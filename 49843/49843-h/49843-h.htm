<h2>TO<br />

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS<br />

THE PRINCE REGENT.</h2>


<p>
SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>The gracious permission which I have received
to dedicate these volumes to your Royal Highness,
affords me an opportunity of interesting
your Royal Highness in favour of the amiable
and ingenuous people whose country they describe.
The high respect they entertain for
British valour and justice, and the lively gratitude
they retain for the generous system of
British Legislation, will, I am sure, give them a
strong claim upon your Royal Highness's good
opinion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Vol I Pg iv]</a></span></p>

<p>To uphold the weak, to put down lawless
force, to lighten the chain of the slave, to sustain
the honour of the British arms and British
good faith; to promote the arts, sciences, and
literature, to establish humane institutions, are
duties of government which have been most
conspicuously performed during your Royal
Highness's regency. For a period of nearly
five years, in which I have had the honour, as
a servant of the East India Company, to preside
over a mild and simple people, it has been
my pride and my ambition to make known to
them the justice and benevolence of my Prince,
whose intentions towards them I could only
fulfil by acting up to the principles of the Authority
which I represented, and by doing every
thing in my power to make them happy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To those who judge that the right to express
their sentiments requires no more than sincerity,
or that their praise is of a value to overbalance
the disrespect of offering it, I shall leave the
usual language of dedications. Conscious that
the assurances of respect and of loyal attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Vol I Pg v]</a></span>ment
can never be offered to your Royal Highness
by the humblest British subject, without
meeting a gracious reception,</p>

<p class="center">I have the honour to be,</p>

<p class="center">With profound veneration and respect,</p>

<p class="center">SIR,</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>As it is possible that, in the many severe strictures
passed, in the course of this work, upon the Dutch
Administration in Java, some of the observations
may, for want of a careful restriction in the words
employed, appear to extend to the Dutch nation and
character generally, I think it proper explicitly to
declare, that such observations are intended exclusively
to apply to the Colonial Government and its
Officers. The orders of the Dutch Government in
Holland to the Authorities at Batavia, as far as my
information extends, breathe a spirit of liberality and
benevolence; and I have reason to believe, that the
tyranny and rapacity of its colonial officers, created
no less indignation in Holland than in other countries
of Europe.</p>

<p>For such, and all other inaccuracies, as well as for
the defects of style and arrangement which may appear
in this work, an apology is necessary; and in the
circumstances under which it has been prepared, it is
hoped that an admissible one will be found. While
in the active discharge of the severe and responsible
duties of an extensive government, it was not in my
power to devote much time to the subject: the most
that I could do, was to encourage the exertions of
others, and to collect in a crude state such new or
interesting matter as fell under my personal observation.
I quitted Java in the month of March in
last year: in the twelve months that have since
elapsed, illness during the voyage to Europe and subsequently,
added to the demands on my time arising
out of my late office, and the duties of private friendship
after an absence of many years, have made great
encroachments; but engaged as I am in public life,
and about to proceed to a distant quarter of the globe,
I have been induced, by the interest which the subject
of these volumes has excited, and the precarious
state of my health, rather to rely on the indulgence
of the public than on the attainment of leisure, for
which I must wait certainly long and, possibly, in vain.</p>

<p>Most sincerely and deeply do I regret, that this
task did not fall into hands more able to do it justice.
There was one<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, dear to me in private friendship and
esteem, who, had he lived, was of all men best calculated
to have supplied those deficiencies which will
be apparent in the very imperfect work now presented
to the Public. From his profound acquaintance with
eastern languages and Indian history, from the unceasing
activity of his great talents, his other prodigious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Vol I Pg viii]</a></span>acquirements, his extensive views, and his
confident hope of illustrating national migrations from
the scenes which he was approaching, much might
have been expected; but just as he reached those
shores on which he hoped to slake his ardent thirst
for knowledge, he fell a victim to excessive exertion,
deeply deplored by all, and by none more truly than
myself.</p>

<p>My acknowledgments are due to the Right Honourable
Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span>, Bart., the venerable President
of the Royal Society, for his kindness and encouragement;
and particularly so to Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Wilkins</span>,
Librarian to the East-India Company, as well as to
Mr. <span class="smcap">William Marsden</span>, for many suggestions, of which
I regret that I have not been enabled to avail myself
so much as I could wish, in consequence of the haste
with which the work has been got up. I am also
indebted to Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Murdoch</span>, not only for access
to his valuable library, but for illustrations from Portuguese
authors, which the reader will find in the
Introduction and Appendix.</p>

<p>For all that relates to the Natural History of Java,
I am indebted to the communications of Dr. <span class="smcap">Thomas
Horsfield</span>. Though sufficient for my purpose, it
forms but a scanty portion of the result of his long
and diligent researches on this subject. Of this, however,
I am happy to say, that the Public will shortly
be able to judge for themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Vol I Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>In sketching the state of the Dutch East-India
Company, and the measures adopted by the Dutch
government respecting Java, subsequently to the year
1780, I have availed myself of much very valuable
information communicated to me by Mr. <span class="smcap">H. W. Muntinghe</span>,
President of the Supreme Court of Justice at
Batavia; and as, in the course of this work, I have
often been obliged to condemn the principles and
conduct of the Dutch colonists, I am anxious to
acknowledge the distinguished merit of this excellent
magistrate, and that of Mr. <span class="smcap">J. C. Cranssen</span>, President
of the Bench of Schepenen, both selected by the late
<span class="smcap">Earl of Minto</span> to be members of the British Council
in Java.</p>

<p>The English came to Java as friends. Holland had
ceased to be an independent nation, and for the time
there could be but two parties, the one English, the
other French. The emissaries of the late ruler of
France had perverted the minds of the majority:
many were doubtful on which side they should rally.
At this critical juncture these two gentlemen declared
for England and the ancient order of things; and to
the influence of their decision and conduct is to be
ascribed, not only the cordiality and good understanding
which soon prevailed between the English and
Dutch, but in a great measure also that general tranquillity
of the country, without which the re-transfer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Vol I Pg x]</a></span>
of it to the rule of its former masters might have
been impracticable.</p>

<p>Of the wisdom and benevolence which determined
the late <span class="smcap">Earl of Minto</span> to place two members of the
Dutch nation at the Board of the British Council in
Java, it is unnecessary to speak. The measure was in
the same spirit which uniformly actuated that enlightened
and virtuous statesman, my revered patron
and ever lamented friend. The selection of the two
gentlemen whom I have mentioned, was no less
advantageous. To their countrymen it was peculiarly
so, and I am happy to have this opportunity of publicly
expressing my acknowledgments to them for the
good counsel, firm support, and unwearied exertions,
by which they were distinguished while members of
the Board.</p>


<h3>ORTHOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p>The principles of Orthography, recommended by
Sir <span class="smcap">William Jones</span>, and adopted by the Asiatic Society
at Calcutta, have been adopted in this work, with
some slight modifications. The consonants preserve
the same sounds generally as the same letters in the
English alphabet: the vowels are used as in Italian.
To avoid confusion, the emphatic syllables are alone
accented, and the inherent vowel <em>a</em> has invariably
been adopted.</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR.</h2>


<p>In reprinting the History of Java in its present
form, the Editor feels it necessary to say a few words.
Though the first edition of this work has been honored
with extraordinary success, and has long been
exhausted, so that copies have become rare, yet
Sir <span class="smcap">Stamford Raffles</span> always considered it as a hasty
production, requiring great alteration and improvement;
and if it had pleased God to prolong his course
of usefulness in this world, he would have bestowed
upon it those corrections and additions which he
thought it required.</p>

<p>The present Editor has only ventured to add a few
short notes which she found prepared by Sir <span class="smcap">Stamford</span>,
and to omit, according to his intention, the
larger part of the comparative vocabularies, retaining
only a hundred words in each language.</p>

<p>The additional plates were prepared some years
ago, for a second quarto edition: they are now published,
with those belonging to the first edition, in a
separate quarto volume, detached entirely from the
present work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Vol I Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>For the drawings from which the engravings of the
antiquities are made, Sir <span class="smcap">Stamford</span> was indebted to
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Baker</span>, of the East India Company's
service; and the present Editor is happy to have this
opportunity of acknowledging the obligation, as well
as her thanks, for many kind intentions to aid her in
reprinting this history.</p>

<p>On the subject of the plates which originally accompanied
the quarto edition, Sir <span class="smcap">Stamford</span> stated in
the Preface to that edition, p. ix, as follows: "The
plates which accompany this work, not otherwise distinguished,
are from the graver, and many of the
designs from the pencil of Mr. <span class="smcap">William Daniell</span>, who
has devoted his undivided attention in forming a
proper conception of his subject, and spared neither
time nor exertion in the execution."</p>

<p>The Editor has only to add, that the size of the
map of Java rendered it impossible to unite it with the
present edition of the History, it is therefore added to
the engravings; and it is also prepared for separate
circulation.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The first arrival of the Portuguese in the Eastern Islands was
in the year 1510, when Alphonzo de Albuquerque first visited
Sumatra. In the following year, Albuquerque conquered the
city of Malacca, and sent to announce that event to those
countries and islands which had traded thither, inviting them
to continue their intercourse, and promising them protection
and encouragement<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. To Java and the Moluccas he sent
Antonio de Abrew, having, however, previously prepared the
way by a Moor or Mahomedan, of the name of <em>Nakoda Ismael</em>,
who was trading in a merchant vessel. Antonio de
Abrew sailed on his mission with three vessels, and took with
him several Javans and Malayus who had been accustomed
to trade with Malacca. The first port on Java at which he
arrived was the city of <em>Agacai</em><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, and from thence he sailed
to Amboina, one of the Moluccas, where<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> he set up his
padroes, or pillars of discovery and possession, as he had
done at every port at which he had touched. One of the
vessels was lost in a storm, but the people were saved and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Vol I Pg xiv]</a></span>carried by Abrew to a port in Banda to which vessels then
resorted for trade, and whither it was that the Javan vessels
used to go for cloves, nutmegs, and mace, which were
carried to that port by the natives of the Moluccas in their
own vessels.</p>

<p><em>Nakoda Ismael</em> returning from the Moluccas with a cargo
of nutmegs, his vessel was wrecked on the coast of Java, near
<em>Tuban</em>. The cargo of the <em>Nakoda's</em> vessel having been saved,
Joam Lopez Alvrin was sent (A. D. 1513) by the governor of
Malacca with four vessels to receive it. Alvrin was well received
in all the ports of Java where he touched, but particularly
at <em>Sidayu</em> belonging to <em>Páteh Unrug</em>, a prince who
had been defeated at Malacca by Fernan Peres.</p>

<p>The straits of <em>Sínga púra</em><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> being infested by the cruisers
of the former king of Malacca, who had been expelled from
his dominions by the Portuguese in 1511, the straits of <em>Sában</em>
were the usual route of the Portuguese vessels from Malacca
to the Spice Islands, and in this voyage they generally touched
at the ports of Java.</p>

<p>About the year 1520 or 1521, Antonio de Britto, with six
vessels under his command, bound to the Moluccas, touched
first at <em>Túban</em> and proceeded afterwards to <em>Agacai</em>, where he
remained seventeen days, during which time he sent a boat
to the island of <em>Madúra</em>, for the purpose of exploring it; but
the men landing incautiously were surprised and made prisoners,
and were not ransomed without much difficulty, and
the friendly intervention of the governor of <em>Agacai</em>.</p>

<p>Antonio de Britto had scarcely accomplished the ransom
of his men, when he was joined by Don Garcia Henriquez
with four vessels bound to Banda for spices, and at the same
time a Javan vessel arrived from Banda. This vessel had
been furnished with a pass from the Spaniards, under Fernan
de Megalhaen, who having passed by the straits which bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Vol I Pg xv]</a></span>
his name, had arrived at the Spice Islands. This was the
first intelligence which the Portuguese received of Megalhaen's
discovery of the route round the southern extremity of
the American continent, and they were the more mortified at
it, as he had left his own country in disgust, and was then

<p>The first voyage made by the Dutch was in 1595, in which
year their first fleet, under the command of Houtman (who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Vol I Pg xvii]</a></span>had been previously employed by the Portuguese in the East
India service), sailed direct to Bantam. At this period th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Vol I Pg xviii]</a></span>e
Portuguese were at war with the king of Bantam, to whom
Houtman offered assistance, in return for which he obtained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Vol I Pg xix]</a></span>permission to build a factory at Bantam, which was the first
settlement formed by the Dutch in the East Indies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Vol I Pg xx]</a></span><br /></p>

<p>Following the example of the Dutch, the English East
India Company, immediately after their incorporation by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Vol I Pg xxi]</a></span>Queen Elizabeth in 1601, fitted out a fleet of four ships, the
command of which was entrusted to Captain Lancaster, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Vol I Pg xxii]</a></span>sailed from London in 1602, first to <em>Acheen</em> (<em>Aché</em>) on Sumatra,
where he procured part of his cargo, and entered into
a treaty with the king, of which a copy is yet in existence.
From <em>Acheen</em> he went to <em>Bantam</em>, and settled a factory there,
which was the first possession of the English in the East
Indies. Captain Lancaster brought home a letter from the
king of Bantam to Queen Elizabeth in 1602, which is still in
the state paper office.</p>

<p>In 1610, the first Dutch governor general, Bolt, arrived at
Bantam, and finding the situation of his countrymen in that
province not favourable to the establishment of a permanent
settlement, removed to <em>Jákatra</em>. On the 4th of March, 1621,
the name of <em>Batavia</em> was conferred upon the new establishment
of the Dutch in <em>Jákatra</em>, which from that period became
the capital of their East Indian empire.</p>

<p>In 1683, the English, who had hitherto maintained a successful
rivalry with the Dutch, withdrew their establishment
from <em>Bantam</em>.</p>

<p>In the year 1811, Holland having become a province of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Vol I Pg xxiii]</a></span>France, the French flag was hoisted at Batavia; and on the
11th September, in the same year, the British government
was declared supreme on Java, by a proclamation of that
date signed by the Earl of Minto, Governor General of
Bengal. On the 17th of the same month, a capitulation was
entered into, by which all the dependencies fell into the hands
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>On the 13th August, 1814, a convention was entered into
by viscount Castlereagh, on the part of his Britannic Majesty,
restoring to the Dutch the whole of their former possessions
in the Eastern Islands; and on the 19th August, 1816, the flag
of the Netherlands was again hoisted at Batavia.</p>

<p>Without adverting to the political importance to Great Britain
of the conquest of Java, or to the great commercial advantages
which both countries might eventually have derived
from its remaining in our hands, I shall merely notice that the
loss of it was no immediate or positive evil to the Dutch. For
many years prior to the British expedition, Holland had
derived little or no advantage from the nominal sovereignty
which she continued to exercise over its internal affairs. All
trade and intercourse between Java and Europe was interrupted
and nearly destroyed; it added nothing to the commercial
wealth or the naval means of the mother country: the
controul of the latter over the agents she employed had proportionally
diminished; she continued to send out governors,
counsellors, and commissioners, but she gained from their inquiries
little information on the causes of her failure, and no
aid from their exertions in improving her resources, or retarding
the approach of ruin. The colony became a burden on the
mother country instead of assisting her, and the Company
which had so long governed it being ruined, threw the load of
its debts and obligations on the rest of the nation.</p>

<p>It might have been some consolation for the loss of immediate
profit, or the contraction of immediate debt, to know,
that such unfavourable circumstances were merely temporary;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Vol I Pg xxiv]</a></span>
that they arose out of a state of political relations which
affected internal improvement, and that the resources of the
colony were progressively increasing, and would become
available when peace or political changes should allow trade
to flow in its former channels. Whether the Dutch could not
indulge such prospects, or whether the system on which the
internal government of their eastern dominion was conducted
was in itself ruinous under any circumstances, a view of the
financial and commercial state of Java before the conquest,
and of the causes which led to the losses and dissolution of
the Dutch East India Company, will assist the reader in determining.</p>

<p>In tracing these causes, it is hardly necessary to go further
back than the period of the Company's history immediately
preceding the war of 1780. The accidental calamities of that
war brought it to the brink of ruin, and its importance in the
past transactions of the country being borne in mind, a general
concern existed in Holland for its preservation, and for the
restoration and maintenance of its credit. With the view of
affording it the most effective and beneficial assistance, inquiries
were set on foot, not only to discover some temporary
means of relief, but to provide a more permanent remedy for
threatened decline. It is impossible to ascertain what might
have been the result of the measures which were then in contemplation,
as the convulsed state of Europe, and especially
of Holland, subsequently to this period, left no room for their
operation, and did not even admit of making the experiment of
their efficiency. The free intercourse of the mother country
with her colonies was interrupted; the trade was thrown into
the hands of neutrals; several possessions were lost for the
want of due protection, and those which remained were left to
support or defend themselves in the best way they could, without
any assistance or reinforcement from home.</p>

<p>For ten years preceding the year 1780, the average annual
sales of the Company amounted to upwards of twenty millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Vol I Pg xxv]</a></span>
of guilders, which was considerably more than in former years,
and the prices of the different articles were nearly the same as
they had been from the years 1648 to 1657, when the sales
only amounted on an average to about eight millions a year;
it was therefore clear, that the decline of the Company was
not to be attributed to the decrease of trade.</p>

<p>On an examination of the Indian books, it was found, that
from the year 1613 to 1696, the profits in India, though moderate,
had always kept equal pace with the profits in Europe.</p>

<p>In 1730 there was already a total loss of 7,737,610, and in
the year 1779 this loss amounted to 84,985,425.</p>

<p>The Company used to send yearly to India, before the commencement
of the war of 1780, twenty ships of about nine
hundred tons each, and eight or ten of about eight hundred
tons each, which, to the number of twenty-two or
twenty-three, returned with cargoes: four from China, three
from Ceylon, three from Bengal, one from Coromandel, and
twelve or thirteen from Batavia. They annually exported
to India provisions and other articles of trade to the amount of
two millions six or eight thousand florins, and in cash from four
to six millions, and sold yearly to an amount generally of
twenty or twenty-one millions; and it was estimated that the
Indian trade maintained, directly and indirectly, all the external
commerce of Holland, employing a capital of about two
hundred and sixty millions of florins.</p>

<p>From the inquiries of a commission appointed by the government
of Holland, in the year 1780, to ascertain the real
state of the Company's finances, and to report how far the nation
would be warranted in giving its further support to the
credit of an institution which had so rapidly declined, it appeared
that in 1789, the arrears of the Company amounted to
seventy-four millions of florins, and that this amount had since
increased to eighty-four or eighty-five millions, of which sum
no less than 67,707,583 florins had been advanced by the
nation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Vol I Pg xxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commissioners, however, being of opinion, that the
affairs of the Company were not irretrievable, recommended
a further loan of seven millions of florins.</p>

<p>A meritorious servant of the Company, Mr. C. Tetsingh,
had offered to the Commissioners a memorial, in which he
proposed that the Company should abandon the trade to
private merchants under certain restrictions; but on this proposal
the Commissioners stated that they were not then prepared
to offer an opinion.</p>

<p>This Commission, in reporting upon the manner in which
the Company's affairs had been managed in India, declared
that "they could not conceal the deep impression which the
same had made upon their minds, and that they could not
fix their thoughts upon it, without being affected with sentiments
of horror and detestation...." "When," said they,
"we take a view of our chief possession and establishment,
and when we attend to the real situation of the internal
trade of India, the still increasing and exorbitant rate of
the expenses, the incessant want of cash, the mass of paper
money in circulation, the unrestrained peculations and
faithlessness of many of the Company's servants, the consequent
clandestine trade of foreign nations, the perfidy of
the native princes, the weakness and connivance of the
Indian government, the excessive expenses in the military
department and for the public defence; in a word, when
we take a view of all this collectively, we should almost
despair of being able to fulfil our task, if some persons of
great talents and ability among the directors had not
stepped forward to devise means by which, if not to eradicate,
at least to stop the further progress of corruption, and
to prevent the total ruin of the Company."</p>

<p>The improvements proposed by the directors extended to
every branch of the administration abroad. They proposed,
first, with regard to the Cape of Good Hope, the yearly
arrears of which settlement had latterly amounted to a million
and a half of florins, that the same should be reduced to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Vol I Pg xxviii]</a></span>
half of that sum. With regard to the further eastern possessions,
the measures proposed for consideration were chiefly
the following.</p>

<p>To confine the Company's future trade to opium, spices,
pepper, Japan copper, tin, and sugar, as far as the European
and Japan markets would require. To abandon the trade to
Western India to the Company's servants and free merchants,
under payment of a certain recognition. To abandon several
factories in that quarter, and to reduce the rest to mere residencies.
To make considerable reductions in the establishment
on the coast of Malabar and in Bengal. To reduce the
establishments on the coast of Coromandel to three factories.
To abandon the establishments on the West coast of Sumatra,
and to leave it open to a free trade. To diminish the expenses
at Ceylon by a reduction of the military force, and by
every other possible means to animate the cultivation and importation
of rice into that settlement. To open a free trade
and navigation to Bengal and Coromandel, under the superintendence
of the Company, on paying a certain recognition.
To encourage, by every means, the cultivation of rice in the
easternmost possessions, and especially at Amboina and
Banda, for the sake of preventing the inducements of a clandestine
trade, which the importation of rice to those places
might afford. To abandon several small factories to the
eastward. To adopt a plan for the trade of Malacca proposed
by Governor De Bruem. To introduce a general reduction
of establishment at Batavia and elsewhere. To introduce
new regulations with regard to the sale of opium at Batavia.
To improve the Company's revenue, by a tax upon salaries
and a duty upon collateral successions. And finally, to send
out commissioners to India, with full powers to introduce a
general reform in the administration.</p>

<p>In a memorial subsequently submitted by the Commissioners,
which formed the basis of all the measures recommended
and adopted at this time, for the better administration
of affairs in India, after shewing that, from the year 1770 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Vol I Pg xxix]</a></span>
1780, the Company had on the whole of its trade and establishments
on the coast of Coromandel, Bengal, Malabar,
Surat, and the western coast of Sumatra, averaged a profit of
only 119,554 florins a year, they recommended the introduction
at Batavia of a public sale of the spices, Japan copper,
and sugar, wanted for the consumption of Western India,
and the establishment of a recognition of ten per cent. on the
piece goods from Bengal, and of fifteen per cent. on the piece
goods from Coromandel. Under such a plan of free trade,
they calculated that, after the diminution of the Company's
establishments in Western India, and the abolition of several
small forts and factories to the eastward, it was highly probable
that the administration in India would, in future, cover
its own expenses, and thereby save the Company from utter
ruin.</p>

<p>It was on these calculations that the Commissioners
appointed by the States of Holland founded their hopes of
the future relief of the Company, and with these prospects
they closed their report, the care and future fate of the Company
devolving from that time chiefly on the Commissioners
appointed at their recommendation to proceed to India, in
order to carry into effect, on the spot, the reforms proposed.
Of these new Commissioners, Mr. Nederburg, then first advocate
to the Company, was appointed the chief.</p>

<p>The Indian Commissioners sailed from Europe in the year
1791. At the Cape of Good Hope they made such changes
and reforms as may be said to have fully effected the object
of their commission. The importance, however, of the Cape
being comparatively small, it is not necessary to enter into
any detail of the measures adopted there. The more momentous
part of their trust was undoubtedly to be discharged in
India, where they arrived in 1793.</p>

<p>If the talents of these Commissioners were to be estimated
by the benefits which resulted from their labours, we may
safely pronounce them to have been incompetent to the task
they had undertaken; but such a criterion cannot with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Vol I Pg xxx]</a></span>
justice be applied. A continuance of peace with Great
Britain was of course reckoned upon in all their calculations,
and war with that power broke out almost immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p>With regard to the abandonment of several forts and factories
to the eastward, to which their attention had been particularly
directed, the result of their deliberation and inquiry
was, that the continuance of the Company's establishment on
Celebes was indispensable for the protection of the Moluccas;
that at Timor reductions had been made, in consequence of
which the revenues covered the expenses; that after mature
investigation the Japan trade was shewn to yield a nett profit
of 200,000 florins; that with regard to the West Coast of
Sumatra the revenues had been made to exceed the expenses,
and the pepper collected in that neighbourhood left still some
profit to the Company.</p>

<p>With respect to the institution of public sales at Batavia
for Japan copper, spices, and sugar, on the introduction of
which it was supposed the establishments in Western India
might be for the most part reduced, they were of opinion,
after deliberating with the Council of India, and after a personal
inquiry into the actual state of the private trade at
Batavia, that chiefly for the want of an adequate means
among the purchasers such sales were entirely impracticable,
and that it would therefore be preferable, after making some
partial reductions in the expense, to continue the establishment
in Bengal and the coast of Coromandel, but that Cochin
on the Malabar coast might, perhaps, be advantageously
abandoned<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p>To determine the mode in which the trade with India
should in future be conducted, these Commissioners assumed
a general calculation of the receipts and disbursements which
would occur at home and abroad, on the supposition that the
Company should, in future, navigate with hired vessels only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Vol I Pg xxxi]</a></span>
and that all marine establishments should be abolished. The
result of this calculation was in abstract as follows. The
estimate may be considered as affording an interesting view
of the hopes and prospects which were at that time entertained
of the resources of the Eastern Islands.</p>

<p>The whole estimate was framed on the principles of monopoly,
and with a view to an increase of the trade on the one
hand, and a reduction of expenses on the other. The quantity
of coffee stated at eighteen million pounds, was calculated
upon the produce which might be expected after two years.
In the calculation of the quantity of pepper, an augmentation
of 1,500,000 pounds beyond the produce of the preceding
year was anticipated, from the encouragement given to the
growth of that article in Bantam and other parts of Java.
With regard to the sugar, calculated at 8,000,000 of pounds
for the home cargoes, it is stated, that the actual deliveries</p>

<p>Or 5,100,000 pounds more than the actual produce. The
whole of that quantity, however, the Commissioners felt confident
might be produced in three years, by encouraging the
manufacture in the Eastern Districts of Java. Among the
retrenchments was a tax upon the salaries of all civil servants,
which reduced the average salary of each to the sum of fifteen
Spanish dollars per month.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Vol I Pg xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>These Commissioners seemed to entertain no very favourable
ideas of the benefits which would arise to private trade
from the license it already enjoyed. As a measure much
more beneficial to the general trade of Europe and to the
Company, they proposed, in lieu of it, to throw open to individuals,
under certain restrictions, the trade and navigation
from Europe to Bengal and Coromandel.</p>

<p>Thus we see these Commissioners sent out with the view
of introducing something like free trade on Java, coming to a
resolution to take away from it even the little private trade
which it had previously been allowed to enjoy.</p>

<p>The Company's trade with continental India had already
been so much encroached upon by foreigners, that it was
judged expedient no longer to exclude the Dutch free trader
from his share in the spoil; but it was hoped, by increased
strictness, to preserve entire to the Company the exclusive
trade in spices, Javan coffee, pepper as far as it was the produce
of her own possessions, Japan copper, the opium which
was consumed in Java and in the Moluccas, and Javan sugar.</p>

<p>The trade of the Dutch Company has thus been brought to
the period, when its monopoly was proposed to be almost
exclusively confined to Java and the Eastern Islands, including
Japan. The causes which operated to destroy the Dutch
influence on the continent of India, are too well known to require
any particular description.</p>

<p>The Dutch had long maintained a decisive superiority, as
well on the continent of Asia, as among the Indian islands,
until the active exertions of their competitors in trade succeeded
in undermining and overturning their monopoly; and
as it was natural their weak side should suffer first, it was on
the continent, where their establishments were far removed
from the chief seat of government, and where they had not
been able to insure to themselves those exclusive privileges
from the princes of the country which they had exacted from
the weaker princes of the Eastern Islands, that other nations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Vol I Pg xxxv]</a></span>
chiefly the French and English, first endeavoured to introduce
themselves.</p>

<p>After reciprocal jealousies had for some time prevented
both nations from making any considerable progress, a successful
war at last turned the scale entirely in favour of the
English, whose influence, from that period, has been paramount
in continental India, and the Dutch East India Company
was no longer able to enforce its system of exclusive
trade there.</p>

<p>Without inquiring into the practicability of realizing the
flattering estimate made out by the Indian Commissioners, or
the policy which dictated a still more rigorous monopoly of
the produce of the Eastern Islands, it ought to be remarked,
although it seems never to have been adverted to by the
Commissioners, whose calculations and plans were exclusively
of a commercial nature, that the original situation of
the Company as a mere mercantile body, looking out for trade
and not dominion, had undergone a material alteration, by
the acquisition it had made from the middle of the last century
of considerable territorial possessions, especially on the
island of Java.</p>

<p>To use the words of one of the most enlightened men who
now adorns his country, and is prepared to give energy to a
better state of things<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, "these territorial acquisitions became
to the Company a source of new relations. In consequence
of them, new rights were acquired and obligations of a
novel kind were contracted, as well with regard to the
territories themselves as the population upon them. The
nature of these rights and duties might have been deemed
worth inquiry; and as all these territorial acquisitions were
made by a delegated authority derived from the government
at home, it was further worthy of investigation how far the
government itself was entitled to a direct share in the
acquisitions made, and how far it was bound to controul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Vol I Pg xxxvi]</a></span>and superintend the exercise of those duties which were
newly contracted. A consideration of these points would
have led to the important question, how far, on a renewal
of the Company's charter, it would be requisite to alter and
modify its conditions according to existing circumstances,
and especially how far it would have been expedient, in
future, to leave the Company the exclusive trade, and at
the same time the uncontrolled sovereignty over the same
country."</p>

<p>But however natural it may be, at the present moment, to
consider questions of this kind, it was perhaps at that time
beyond the common course of human thought to entertain
doubts on the subject. From an honourable regard for ancient
institutions, the mercantile system of the Company was
still considered with reverence and respect; it had been at
all times the boast and pride of the nation; the services which
the Company had rendered to the state in its earlier days, and
the immense benefits which the government had been enabled,
by its means, to spread among the community at large, had
rendered the East India Company and all its privileges, objects
of peculiar care and tenderness. The rights of sovereignty
which the Company afterwards acquired, were obtained
by degrees and almost imperceptibly. Every acquisition
of the kind had been considered, at the time, merely as
the means of increasing its mercantile profits, and all its territorial
rights were looked upon as subservient to its mercantile
system.</p>

<p>In consequence of these ideas, after the whole of the
northern and eastern coast of Java had been added to the
Company's territorial dominions, by a cession in the year
1749, no step seems to have been taken for improving these
acquisitions, by any direct use of the supremacy obtained.
Some contracts were instituted with the native chiefs, for
delivering gratis, or at the lowest possible price, such articles
as would serve the Company's investments at home; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Vol I Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
taxation, the levy of produce, and the management of police
and justice in the inferior courts, were left to the care and
conscience of the natives themselves.</p>

<p>Arguments in favour of this system may perhaps be drawn
from the respect due to the native usages and institutions,
and from a supposed want of power, on the part of the Company,
to assume any direct controul over the native population.
But whatever influence these ideas may have had on
the conduct of the Company, it may be affirmed that an
European government, aiming only to see right and justice
administered to every class of the population, might and
ought to have maintained all the native usages and institutions,
not inconsistent with those principles; and that the
power, for want of which it withheld its interference, would
have been supplied and confirmed by the act of exercising
the power which it possessed, and by the resources it might
have been the means of drawing from the country.</p>

<p>Considering, therefore, the propensity inherent in every
native authority to abuse its influence, and to render it oppressive
to the population at large; the ascendancy of Europeans
in general, even over the class of native chieftains; the scantiness
of many of the establishments proposed in the plan of
the Indian Commissioners; the manifest inadequacy of the
remuneration of the civil servants which it recommended,
and the narrow scale on which all expenses were calculated;
no very durable benefits could have been reasonably expected
from it. The discretionary power being left in the hands of
the native chieftains, the whole of the lower class of the population
would have remained at their disposal; the ascendancy
of the European servants would have subjected both to peculations,
which the insufficiency of their salaries would constantly
have tempted them to practice; the administration of
justice not meeting with a proper remuneration would have
been ineffectual, perhaps corrupt; the reduction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Vol I Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
military establishment would have left the possessions an
easy prey to the first invader; and the original sources of the
Company's revenues in India remaining the same, it seems
probable, that in a short time, the same scenes which had
hitherto met with so much reprobation, would have been
acted over again, and to a still more disgraceful extent.</p>

<p>But of whatever merit might have been the plans suggested
by the Commissioners in India on the 4th July, 1795, the
calamities which had already befallen the mother country
were followed by an event, which it seems the Commissioners
had hardly dared to suspect, and which, in every case, would
have frustrated all their designs. This was the dissolution of
the Company, in consequence of a resolution taken to that
effect on the 24th December, by the body then representing
the government of the United States of Holland.</p>

<p>New views of policy were of course suggested by this important
change. In the year 1800 there appeared a small
volume, entitled "A Description of Java and of its principal
Productions, shewing the Advantages to be derived therefrom
under a better Administration, by Mr. Dirk Van
Hogendorp," in which the writer, after observing that the
true state of Java and its importance to the mother country
had hitherto been little known, or at least that no correct
ideas had yet been formed in Holland with regard to its value,
fertility, population, and advantageous situation for trade,
establishes,</p>

<p>"1. That the system on which the trade in India had
hitherto been conducted and the possessions administered,
was no longer good under present circumstances, but contained
in itself the seeds of decline and ruin.</p>

<p>"2. That the exclusive trade was in its nature injurious,
and naturally caused the ruin of the colonies.</p>

<p>"3. That under a different system, those colonies would
flourish, and yield much greater advantages than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Vol I Pg xxxix]</a></span></p>

<p>"4. That a revenue, founded on the principles of freedom
of trade, property in the soil, and equality of imposts, could
be easily introduced.</p>

<p>"5. And finally, that all the benefits which would thereby
accrue to the mother country, from the territorial revenue,
the duties on trade, the industry and wealth for which that
trade would furnish employment, and the treasures which
the distribution of produce throughout Europe must bring
into the mother country, would greatly exceed the highest
advantages that could be calculated upon, even under the
most favourable prospects, by the means of the fallen Company
or a continuation of its former system."</p>

<p>Many parts of this pamphlet abound in violence and
invective, and others are too highly coloured; but with these
exceptions, it may be safely asserted that it contains a more
correct view of the state of society, and of the resources of
the country, than any paper which had preceded it, and the
author is most justly entitled to all the credit of having
chalked out to his countrymen the road to honour and prosperity,
in the future administration of the Dutch East-Indian
colonies.</p>

<p>Having, in the course of the foregoing sketch of the decline
and fall of the Dutch East-India Company, exhibited a
statement of these resources, under the mercantile system of
the Company, it may be interesting also to state what, in the
opinion of Mr. Hogendorp, the island of Java alone was
capable of affording eventually, under a system founded on
the principles of property in the soil, freedom of cultivation
and trade, and the impartial administration of justice according
to equal rights. "When the exclusive and oppressive
trade of the Company, the forced deliveries, the feudal
services, in short, the whole system of feudal government,
is done away with, and when the effects of this important
revolution are felt in the certain increase of cultivation and
trade, then," observes Mr. Hogendorp, "the limits of pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Vol I Pg xl]</a></span>bability
will by no means be exceeded, in estimating the
aggregate of the revenues of Java, in progress of time, at
twelve millions of rix-dollars, or twenty-four millions of
guilders, annually."</p>

<p>This statement, calculated with reference to the comparative
produce of the West India Islands, has been generally
considered by the colonists as exhibiting a very exaggerated
view, of what the island could, under any circumstances,
afford, and by many as too wild a speculation to
deserve attention; but to this it should be added, that the
plan on which it was founded, viz. an entire change in the
internal management of the country, was considered as
equally wild and romantic by those who declaimed the
loudest against the possibility of these advantages accruing,
and that notwithstanding the doubts then entertained of its
practicability, that measure has been actually carried into
effect, without producing any one of the consequences depicted
by the advocates of the old system, and as far as a
judgment can yet be formed, with all the advantages anticipated
by Mr. Hogendorp.</p>

<p>It is not surprising to find, that the enlightened views of
this writer were never acted upon, when we find it asserted
by a commission, who sat at the Hague in 1803, composed of
the highest, and perhaps best qualified persons in the state of
Holland, and of which he was himself a member (of course a
dissenting one), that "it appeared to them to have been admitted
generally, and without contradiction, that according
to ancient regulations, of which the first institution was lost
even among the Javans themselves, the manner in which
that people are used to live rests on principles, with which
a free and unlimited disposition of the ground and its productions
is absolutely inconsistent; that they were, for
their parts, convinced that such a change could not be
effected, without causing a general fermentation among all
classes of people; that though, in this case, violent mea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Vol I Pg xli]</a></span>sures
might suppress an insurrection, they would rather
advise to bid an eternal farewell to Java, than to resort to
such means; that if they adverted to the question in a commercial
point of view, the same uncertainty, the same
dangers presented themselves. These arose from the
natural disinclination of the Javan to work, which has been
observed by many eminent persons; the danger of new
monopolies, which would fall heavier upon the common
people than the present forced deliveries; the exorbitant
charges to support a great number of native chiefs and
priests, who are at present provided for and ought to be
supported; an undoubted deficiency in the revenues, and a
considerable expenditure during the first years, without the
probability of a remedy. All this," say they, "seems to
forebode a neglect of the cultivation; and after long and
laborious researches, we are compelled to lay it down as a
general principle, that property, of the soil among the
common Javans, and the abolition of public services, cannot
be adopted as the basis of an improvement, of which the
internal management of Java would be susceptible. The
contingents and forced deliveries ought therefore to be continued
and received on account of the state, which has succeeded
to the prerogatives of the former Company<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>."</p>

<p>Marshal Daendels, who was recalled from the government
of Java only a few months before the British conquest, and
who was by far the most active and energetic governor who
had for a long time been at the head of the colony, has written
an account of his own administration, of the state in which he
found the island, of the measures he proposed and executed,
of the improvements which he projected or carried into effect,
of the revenues that might be expected, and of the expenditure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Vol I Pg xlii]</a></span>
that the public service required. Although he enters into
some free and bold strictures on the conduct of the Commissioners,
the estimates they formed, and the policy they recommended,
he does not seem himself to have avoided many of
the faults which rendered their policy objectionable, or to
have entertained any hope of establishing a more liberal system.
Forced services and contingents, and all the tyranny
which they render necessary, still constituted the greatest part
of the ways and means of the colonial treasury, and the grand
source of profits for the Company.</p>

<p>The difficulties he had to struggle with, and the peculiar
habits and character formed by his profession, seem to have
determined his proceedings, more than any matured scheme
of general administration, or any deliberate principles of government.
He thus describes the situation of the colony on
his arrival: "A powerful enemy threatened us by sea, and the
Javan princes, acquiring audacity in proportion as they saw
proofs of our weakness, thought the moment had arrived for
prescribing the law to their former superiors. The very existence
of our dominions on Java was thus in the greatest
danger. Our internal resources of finance were exhausted,
while a stagnation of trade, caused by the blockade of our
shores, cut off all hopes of procuring assistance from without.
In the midst of such disastrous circumstances, and the
failure of so many attempts to introduce reform, and to maintain
the dignity of government, <em>I found it necessary to place
myself above the usual formalities, and to disregard every
law, but that which enjoined the preservation of the colony
entrusted to my management</em>. The verbal order which I received,
at my departure from Holland, had this for its object,
and the approbation bestowed upon my attempts to
carry it into execution, encouraged me in the course of proceeding
which I had began."</p>

<p>The situation in which the Marshal found the colony is
justly drawn; but the result of his operations, and the condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Vol I Pg xliii]</a></span>tion
in which he left the government to his successor, are described
in colours by far too flattering. His partiality for his
own work, and the consciousness of having made great exertions
to accomplish it, seems to have influenced his mind too
easily, in convincing him of the advantage and success of the
measures he had adopted. "In spite," says he, "of all the
obstacles I encountered, I obtained the following results. I
made the general government the centre of authority, from
which every inferior authority descended in a determined
proportion, with a definite responsibility and a salutary controul.
Into all the local and subordinate administrations,
clearness and simplicity were introduced; agriculture was
encouraged, protected, and extended; general industry was
promoted; the administration of justice and of the police
was put on a sure footing; the means of defence were increased
as much as possible; many works were undertaken,
both for the service of government and other useful ends;
new roads were made and old ones improved; the condition
of all the inhabitants, as well native as European, was ameliorated,
and every cause of misunderstanding removed; the
relations of the colonial government with the courts of the
native princes were regulated on principles, conformable to
the dignity, and conducive to the interests of the former;
and, in fine, the revenues of the colony were so augmented,
that after every deduction for internal expenditure, they will
furnish a surplus of five millions, free of all charge, as a nett
return to Holland."</p>

<p>Marshal Daendels, in his memoir, sufficiently showed the
fallacy contained in the report of the Commissioners, concerning
the estimated revenue and profits of the Company.
Instead of the receipt of 1,250,000 florins, accruing from the
profit of the sale of opium (as marked in the table which I
have transcribed), he assures us that not one farthing was
actually obtained. Many of the conclusions of the Commissioners,
concerning the temper of the inhabitants, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Vol I Pg xliv]</a></span>
nature of the soil of particular districts, and the general resources
of the island, he satisfactorily proved to be founded
on erroneous information or mistake; and it is only to be
regretted, that he did not carry the same spirit of impartiality
into the formation of his own reports, which he requires in
those of his predecessors, or anticipates from his successors, an
examination equally rigorous, and a measure of justice equally
strict as that to which they were subjected. Had this been
the case, we should not have been offered such financial
results as make the revenue of the island amount to 10,789,000
rix-dollars, and its expenditure only 5,790,000, leaving a
balance of five millions of profit. It may be interesting to
compare his estimate with the table already exhibited.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Vol I Pg xlv]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The following is the description of Java from Jono de Barros, Decada
4, book 1, chap. 12.
</p>
<p>
"Before we treat of the expedition of Francisco de Sa, it is proper to
state the occasion of the expedition, and how that was connected with
the treaty of peace and friendship which, by order of Jorge de Albuquerque,
governor of Malacca, Henriquez Lerne concluded with the
King of Sunda, on account of the pepper produce in that kingdom.
</p>
<p>
"We must, therefore, first give an account of the voyage of Henriquez
Lerne. The kingdom of Sunda being one of those of the
island of Java, it will be best to begin with a general description of
that island, that what follows may be understood.
</p>
<p>
"The land of Java we consider as two islands, whose position is from
east to west, and nearly in the same parallel, in seven or eight degrees
of south latitude. The total length of the two islands, according to
the best authorities, is about one hundred and eighty leagues, although
perhaps this is rather exaggerated.
</p>
<p>
"The Javans themselves do not divide the land into two islands, but
consider the whole length as constituting only one; and on the west,
where it approaches Sumatra, there is a channel of ten or twelve
leagues wide, through which all the navigation of eastern and western
India used to pass, previous to the founding of Malacca.
</p>
<p>
"A chain of very high mountains runs along the whole length of
Java. Their distance from the northern coast is about twenty-five
leagues. How far they are from the southern shore is not certainly
known, though the natives say about as far as from the northern.
</p>
<p>
"Sunda, of which we are now to treat, is situated at about one-third
of the total length of Java from the west end. The natives of Sunda
consider themselves as separated from Java by a river, called <em>Chiamo</em>
or <em>Chenan</em>, little known to our navigators; so that the natives, in dissecting
Java, speak of it as separated by this river <em>Chiamo</em> from the
island of Sunda on the west, and on the east by a strait from the island
of Báli; as having Madura on the north, and on the south an undiscovered
sea; and they think that whoever shall proceed beyond
those straits, will be hurried away by strong currents, so as never to be
able to return, and for this reason they never attempt to navigate it, in
the same manner as the Moors on the eastern coast of Africa do not
venture to pass the Cape of Currents."
</p>
<p>
The following is the substance of a note inserted in Jono de Barros,
Decadas, p. 76-77, vol. 4, part 1st, 8vo. Lisbon 1777.
</p>
<p>
"The island of Java is divided into many kingdoms along the northern
coast; and beginning to the eastward, those of which we have any
account are​&mdash;<em>Paneruca</em>, <em>Ovalle</em>, <em>Agasai</em>, <em>Paniao</em> (whose king resides in
the interior, and has a supremacy over those just mentioned), <em>Beredam</em>,
<em>Sodaio</em>, <em>Tubam</em>, <em>Cajoam</em>, <em>Japara</em> (the capital of this kingdom is called
<em>Cheronhama</em>, three leagues from the sea coast, near to which <em>Japara</em> is
situated), <em>Damo</em>, <em>Margam</em>, and <em>Matarem</em>.
</p>
<p>
"In the mountainous interior live a numerous class of chiefs, called
Gunos: they are a savage race, and eat human flesh. The first inhabitants
were Siamese, who about the year 800 of the Christian era, on
their passage from Siam to Macassar were driven by a great storm on
the island of <em>Báli</em>. Their junk being wrecked they escaped in their
boat, and arrived at Java, until that period undiscovered; but which,
on account of its size and fertility was immediately peopled by <em>Passara</em>,
son of the king of Siam: and the city of <em>Passaraan</em>, called after his
own name, was founded at a very good seaport, and this was the first
settlement on the island.
</p>
<p>
"The Javans are proud, brave, and treacherous, and so vindictive,
that for any slight offence (and they consider as the most unpardonable
the touching their forehead with your hand) they declare <em>amok</em> to
revenge it. They navigate much to every part of the Eastern Archipelago,
and say that formerly they used to navigate the ocean as far as
the island of Madagascar (St. Laurence).
</p>
<p>
"The city of <em>Bintam</em>, or <em>Banta</em>, which is in the middle of the opening
of the straits of Sunda, stands in the centre of a large bay, which
from point to point may be about three leagues wide, the bottom good,
and the depth of water from two to six fathoms. A river of sufficient
depth for junks and galleys, falls into this bay, and divides the town
into two parts. On one side of the town there is a fort, built of sun-dried
bricks: the walls are about seven palms thick, the bulwarks of
wood, well furnished with artillery.
</p>
<p>
"The island of Sunda is more mountainous than Java. It has six
good sea-ports: <em>Chiamo</em>, at the extremity of the island; <em>Chacatara</em>, or
<em>Caravam</em>; <em>Tangaram</em>, <em>Cheginde</em>, <em>Pandang</em>, and <em>Bintam</em>, which have a
great traffic, on account of the trade carried on, not only with Java, but
with Malacca and Sumatra.
</p>
<p>
"The principal city of this kingdom is called <em>Daro</em>, situated a little
towards the interior, and we are assured that when Henriquez Lerne
first visited it, this town had upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants,
and that the kingdom had upwards of one hundred thousand fighting
men.
</p>
<p>
"The soil is very rich. An inferior gold, of six carats, is found.
There is abundance of butcher's meat, game and provisions, and tamarinds
which serve the natives for vinegar. The inhabitants are not
very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries, and hate the Mahomedans,
and particularly since they were conquered by the <em>Sangue Páti
Dama</em>.
</p>
<p>
"Here four or five thousand slaves may be purchased, on account of
the numerous population, and its being lawful for the father to sell the
children. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste,
which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are
monasteries or convents for the women, into which the nobles put
their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according
to their wishes. The married women, when their husbands die, must,
as a point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of
death they are put into the convents.
</p>
<p>
"The kingdom descends from father to son, and not from uncle to
nephew, (son of the sister), as among the Malabars and other infidels
in India.
</p>
<p>
"They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work.
Their <em>krises</em> are gilt, and also the point of their lances. Many other
particulars might be added (but we reserve them for our geography<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>),
concerning the productions of this island, in which upwards of thirty
thousand quintals of pepper are collected annually."
</p>
<p class="center">
Decad. iv. Chapter 13.
</p>
<p>
"In the year 1522, Jorge Albuquerque, governor of Malacca, equipped
a vessel to carry Henriquez Lerne, with a competent suite and certain
presents, to the king Samiam above mentioned, for the purpose of
establishing a commercial intercourse. Lerne was well received by the
king, who was fully sensible of the importance of such a connection, in
the war in which he was then engaged with the Moors (Mahomedans);
and, therefore, he requested that, for the protection of the trade, the
king of Portugal should erect a fortress, and that he would load as
many ships as he chose with pepper, in return for such merchandise as
the country required. And further, he (the king) obliged himself, as a
pledge of his friendship, to give him annually a thousand bags of
pepper, from the day on which the building of the fortress should
commence.
</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>
"These things being concluded and presents exchanged, Lerne returned
to Malacca, where he was well received by Albuquerque, who
immediately communicated the result to the king of Portugal, who
approved of all that had been done.
</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>
"Francisco de Sá was in consequence dispatched with six vessels (the
names of which and of their commanders are enumerated), with which
he called at Malacca, and accompanied the expedition against Bintam
(then in the possession of the expelled king of Malacca), on leaving
which he was overtaken by a dreadful storm, and one of his vessels,
commanded by Dironte Coelho, reached the port of Calapa (where the
fort was to be built), where she was driven on shore, and all the crew
perished by the hands of the Moors (Mahomedans), who were then
masters of the country, having a few days before taken the town from
the native king, who had concluded the treaty with the King of Portugal,
and given him the site on which to erect the fortress.
</p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>
"But although the intended establishment on Java was thus frustrated,
the Portuguese continued to have intercourse with that island,
at which they frequently touched on their voyage to and from the
Moluccas."
</p>
<p class="center">
Decad. iv. Book i. Chapter 14.
</p>
<p>
"In August, 1626, Antonio de Britto, on his return from Ternati to
Malacca, touched at the port of Paneruca, where he found his countryman,
Jono de Moreno, who had twenty Malay junks under his
command. From thence he proceeded to the town of <em>Tagasam</em>, whose
inhabitants were at war with the Portuguese, and had captured a junk
laden with cloves, which he had dispatched to Malacca, and they even
attempted to take the vessel in which he himself was, which occasioned
his quitting that place, having however first captured a junk
laden with provisions."
</p>

<p class="center">Decad. iv. Book i. Chapter 17.</p>
<p>
"In July, 1528, Don Garcia Henriquez appears to have touched at
the port of Paneruca, (Panarukan) for the purpose of taking in provisions
on his way to Malacca; and it also appears, that the king or
chief of Paneruca sent ambassadors to the Portuguese governor of
Malacca in the same year 1528."
</p>
<p>
The following is the substance of a description of Java from the Decada
of Diego de Couto.​&mdash;Decad. iv. Book iii. Chapter i.
</p>
<p>
Couto describes the wreck of a Portuguese vessel, and the destruction
of her crew by the Moors, who had just become masters of the kingdom
of Sunda, in nearly the same words as Barros. He then proceeds to
state, that Francis de Sá ran before the storm along the coast of Java, and
collected his scattered vessels in the port of <em>Paneruca</em>, and gives a general
description of Java in nearly the following words.
</p>
<p>
"But it will be proper to give a concise description of this country,
and to shew which were the Greater and the Lesser Java of Marco
Polo, and clear up the confusion which has prevailed among modern
geographers on this subject.
</p>
<p>
"The figure of the island of Java resembles a hog couched on its fore
legs, with its snout to the channel of <em>Balaberao</em>, and its hind legs
towards the mouth of the Straits of Sunda, which is much frequented
by our ships. This island lies directly east and west; its length about
one hundred and sixty, and its breadth about seventy leagues.
</p>
<p>
"The southern coast (hog's back) is not frequented by us, and its bays
and ports are not known; but the northern coast (hog's belly) is much
frequented, and has many good ports: and although there are many
shoals, yet the channels and the anchorages are so well known, that
but few disasters happen.
</p>
<p>
"There are many kingdoms along the maritime parts, some of them
subordinate to the others; and beginning at the east (head of the hog),
we will set down the names of such as are known: <em>Ovalle</em>, <em>Paneruca</em>,
<em>Agasai</em>, <em>Sodayo</em>, <em>Paniao</em> (whose sovereign resides thirty leagues inland,
and is a kind of emperor over these and others hereafter mentioned),
<em>Tabao</em>, <em>Berdoao</em>, <em>Cajoao</em>, <em>Japara</em> (whose principal city or town is called
Cerinhama, three leagues inland, while Japara is situated on the sea
shore), <em>Damo</em>, <em>Margao</em>, <em>Banta</em>, <em>Sunda</em>, <em>Andreguir</em> (where there is much
pepper, which is exported by a river called Jande). In the mountainous
interior there are many kings, called <em>Gunos</em>; they live among
rugged mountains, are savage and brutal, and many of them eat
human flesh."
</p>
<p>
"These mountains are exceedingly high, and some of them emit flames
like the island of Ternati. Every one of these kingdoms which we
have named has a language of its own; yet they mutually understand
each other, as we do the Spaniards and Galicians.
</p>
<p>
"The kingdom of Sunda is thriving and abundant; it lies between
Java and Sumatra, having between it and the latter the Straits of
<em>Sunda</em>. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the
Straits, for nearly the space of forty leagues, which in the widest are
about twenty-five, and in others only twelve leagues broad. <em>Banta</em> is
about the middle distance. All the islands are well timbered, but have
little water. A small one, called <em>Macar</em>, at the entrance of the Straits,
is said to have much gold.
</p>
<p>
"The principal ports of the kingdom of <em>Sunda</em> are <em>Banta</em>, <em>Aché</em>, <em>Chacatara</em>
(or, by another name, <em>Caravao</em>), to which every year resort
about twenty <em>Sommas</em>, which are a kind of vessel belonging to <em>Chienhec</em>
(Cochin China), out of the maritime provinces of China, to load
pepper. For this kingdom produces eight thousand <em>bahars</em>, which are
equal to thirty thousand quintals of pepper annually.
</p>
<p>
"Bantam is situated in six degrees of south latitude, in the middle of
a fine bay, which is three leagues from point to point. The town in
length, stretching landward, is eight hundred and fifty fathoms, and the
seaport extends about four hundred. A river capable of admitting
junks and galleys, flows through the middle of the town: a small
branch of this river admits boats and small craft.
</p>
<p>
"There is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick, with
wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is
good; in some places a muddy, in others a sandy bottom, the depth
from two to six fathoms.
</p>
<p>
"The King, Don John, conceiving that if he had a fortress in this
situation he should be master of the Straits, and of all the pepper of
those kingdoms, recommended it strongly to the lord admiral to have a
fort built by Francisco de Sa; and even now it would be perhaps still
more important as well for the purpose of defending the entrance against
the English and the Turks, as for the general security of the trade and
commerce of those parts, which is the principal value of India. And it
was the opinion of our forefathers, that if the king possessed three
fortresses, one in this situation, one on <em>Acheen head</em>, and one on the
coast of <em>Pegu</em>, the navigation of the east would in a manner be locked
by these keys, and the king would be lord of all its riches; and they
gave many reasons in support of their opinions, which we forbear to
repeat, and return to Java.
</p>
<p>
"The island of Java is abundantly furnished with every thing necessary
to human life; so much so, that from it <em>Malacca</em>, <em>Acheen</em>, and other
neighbouring countries, derive their supplies.
</p>
<p>
"The natives, who are called <em>Jaos</em> (Javans), are so proud that they
think all mankind their inferiors; so that, if a Javan were passing along
the street, and saw a native of any other country standing on any
hillock or place raised higher than the ground on which he was walking,
if such person did not immediately come down until he should have
passed, the Javan would kill him, for he will permit no person to stand
above him; nor would a Javan carry any weight or burthen on his
head, even if they should threaten him with death.
</p>
<p>
"They are a brave and determined race of men, and for any slight
offence will run <em>amok</em> to be revenged; and even if they are run through
and through with a lance, they will advance until they close with their
adversary.
</p>
<p>
"The men are expert navigators, in which they claim priority of all
others; although many give the honour to the Chinese, insisting that
they preceded the Javans. But it is certain that the Javans have sailed
to the Cape of Good Hope, and have had intercourse with the island
of Madagascar on the off side, where there are many people of a brown
colour, and a mixed Javan race, who descend from them."
</p>
<p>
Then follows the refutation of a ridiculous story told by Nicolas
Couti, the Venetian, about a tree that produced a rod of gold in its pith,
at which some well informed Javans, of whom Couti inquired, laughed
very heartily.
</p>
<p>
"Marco Polo mentions the greater and the lesser Java. We are of
opinion, that the Java of which we are treating is the lesser, and that
the island of Sumatra is the greater Java; for he says that the greater
Java is two thousand miles in circumference, and that the north star is
not visible, and that it has eight kingdoms, <em>Taleh</em>, <em>Basma</em>, <em>Camara</em>,
<em>Dragojao</em>, <em>Lambri Farafur</em>, from which it is very clear that he means
Sumatra, for it has nearly the dimensions which he assigns it. The
north pole is not visible, as this island lies under the equinoctial line,
which is not the case with any of the islands situated to the northward,
on all of which the north star is seen: and it is still more evident
from the names of the kingdoms, for there cannot be a doubt that
<em>Camara</em> is the same as <em>Camatra</em> (the ç being soft like s). <em>Dragojao</em>
(which is pronounced <em>Dragojang</em>) or <em>Andreguir</em>, and <em>Lambri</em>, still retain
their names on that island."</p></div>

<p>The country known to Europeans under the name of <span class="smcap">Java</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Java Major</span>, and to the natives under those of <em>Tána</em>
(the land) <em>Jáwa</em>, or <em>Núsa</em> (the island) <em>Jáwa</em>, is one of the
largest of what modern geographers call the Sunda Islands.
It is sometimes considered one of the Malayan Islands, and
forms a part of that division of the Oriental Archipelago which
it has been lately proposed to designate as the Asiatic Isles.
It extends eastward, with a slight deviation to the south,
from 105° 11´ to 114° 33´ of longitude east of Greenwich, and
lies between the latitudes 5° 52´ and 8° 46´ south. On the
south and west it is washed by the Indian Ocean; on the
north-west by a channel called the Straits of <em>Súnda</em>, which
separates it from Sumatra, at a distance in one point of only
fourteen miles; and on the south-east by the Straits of <em>Báli</em>,
only two miles wide, which divide it from the island of that
name. These islands, and others stretching eastward, form
with Java a gentle curve of more than two thousand geographical
miles, which with less regularity is continued from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Vol I Pg 2]</a></span>
Acheen to Pegu on one side, and from <em>Tímor</em> to <em>Papúa</em>, or
New Guinea, on the other: they constitute on the west and
south, as do <em>Bánka</em>, <em>Bíliton</em>, the great islands of Borneo and
Celebes, and the Moluccas on the north, the barriers of the
Javan Seas and the Malayan Archipelago. From the eastern
peninsula of India, Java is distant about one hundred and
forty leagues, from Borneo about fifty-six, and from New
Holland two hundred.</p>

<p>To what cause the island is indebted for its present name
of Java<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> (or <em>Jáwa</em> as it is pronounced by the natives) is uncertain.
Among the traditions of the country (which are more
particularly mentioned in another place) there is one, which
relates, that it was so termed by the first colonists from the
continent of India, in consequence of the discovery of a
certain grain, called <em>jáwa-wut</em>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> on which the inhabitants are
supposed to have subsisted at that early period, and that it
had been known previously only under the term of <em>Núsa hára-hára</em>
or <em>Núsa kêndang</em>, meaning the island of wild uncultivated
waste, or in which the hills run in ridges.</p>

<p>In the tenth chapter of Genesis we are told, that "the isles
of the Gentiles were divided in their lands; every one after
his tongue, after their families, in the nations:" and in the
twenty-seventh chapter of Ezekiel we find among the rich
merchants, those of <em>Javan</em> "who traded the persons of men,
and vessels of brass, to the market of Tyre, and who going to
and fro, occupied in her fairs, brought bright iron, cassia, and
calamus." But we shall leave it to others to trace the connection
between the <em>Javan</em> of Holy Writ and the Java of
modern times. It appears, that the Arabs, who had widely
extended their commercial intercourse, and established their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Vol I Pg 3]</a></span>religious faith over the greatest portion of the Indian Archipelago,
long before the Europeans had navigated round the
Cape of Good Hope, designate the whole of the nations and
tribes which inhabit those regions by the general term of the
people of <em>Jawi</em>, as in the following passage taken from one of
their religious tracts:​&mdash;"The people of <em>Jawi</em> do not observe
with strictness the rule laid down for keeping the fast, inasmuch
as they eat before the sun sets, while the Arabs continue
the fast until that luminary has sunk below the horizon."
<em>Jawa</em> or <em>Jawi</em> is also the name by which Borneo, Java, Sumatra,
the Malayan Peninsula, and the islands lying amongst
them, are known among the nations of Celebes, who apply
the <em>Búgis</em> diminutive <em>Jawa-Jawáka</em>, or Java minor, to the
Moluccas, <em>Ámbon</em>, <em>Bánda</em>, <em>Tímor</em>, and <em>Éndé</em>. Jabadios Insulæ,
from <em>Jaba</em>, and <em>dib</em>, <em>div</em> or <em>dio</em>, has been employed in
the largest sense by Europeans, and it is probable this was
once generally the case among the Asiatics, with the terms
<em>Java</em>, <em>Jawa</em>, <em>Jawi</em>, and <em>Jaba</em>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which, as the appellations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Vol I Pg 4]</a></span>people inhabiting the countries beyond the continent or distant,
some have derived from the word <em>jaù</em>, of very general
acceptation in eastern languages, and meaning <em>beyond</em>,
<em>distant</em>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It is, perhaps, in consequence of these names having embraced
the whole, or at least several of the islands collectively,
that the accounts given by Marco Polo, and other early European
voyagers, of particular islands, as Java Major and Java
Minor, are so inconsistent with one another. The country
described by Marco Polo as Java Minor, seems, beyond doubt,
to have been the eastern coast of Sumatra; but that expression,
"or Little Java," is now applied exclusively to <em>Báli</em>, as
"Great Java" is to the island we are now describing. It is
on the latter only, if we except what has been observed of the
names given to the Archipelago generally by the natives of
Celebes, that the islanders themselves apply the name of
<em>Jawa</em>, in any of its forms, to their own country. It has there
even a still more confined application, being generally limited
to the eastern districts of the island, which may be considered
as Java proper, in contra-distinction to the western districts,
which are for the most part inhabited by a people called <em>Súnda</em>,
from whom the Straits and Isles of Sunda have been named by
Europeans.</p>

<p>Whether Sumatra, Java, or any other island of the Archipelago,
or the whole or several of them collectively, may not
have formed the <em>Taprobane</em> of the ancients, is perhaps still an
undecided question, notwithstanding the claims to this distinction
which have of late years been rather admitted than
proved in favour of Ceylon. The most striking fact detailed
in the accounts which have reached us of this ancient country,
and one which, from its nature, is least likely to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Vol I Pg 5]</a></span>
disfigured or perverted by the misrepresentations or prejudices
of travellers, is, that it was bisected in nearly equal portions
by the equinoctial line, and that to the southward of it the
polar star was not visible. How can this statement be evaded,
or in any way applied to Ceylon? Major Wilford seems inclined
to consider <em>Taprobane</em> as derived from the Sanscrit
words <em>tapa</em> (penance) and <em>vana</em> (forest or grove), a derivation
equally favorable to the claims of the Javans, <em>tapa</em> and <em>wana</em>,
or <em>wono</em>, having the like signification in their language; and
if, as there is reason to believe, an extensive intercourse subsisted
in very remote times between Western India and these
islands, where was there a country that could more invite the
retreat of holy men, than the evergreen islands which rise in
endless clusters on the smooth seas of the Malayan Archipelago,
where the elevation and tranquillity of devotion are
fostered by all that is majestic and lovely in nature?</p>

<p>Although in Sumatra no traces of their residence have yet
been discovered, except in the language and customs of the
people; on Java, which is almost contiguous to it, it is abundantly
attested by monuments still existing in stone and brass.
In few countries, with which we are yet acquainted, are more
extensive ruins to be found of temples dedicated to an ancient
worship. If tradition may be trusted, every mountain had its
<em>tapa</em>, or recluse, and the whole energies and resources of the
country would appear to have been applied to the construction
of those noble edifices, the ruins of which still strike the spectator
with astonishment and veneration.</p>

<p>That these splendid and magnificent piles were erected
under the superintendance of a foreign people, more skilled
in the arts than the rude and simple natives of the islands,
can scarcely be doubted; and that they were sacred to the
rites of the Hindu religion, according to some persuasion
or other, is equally clear, from the numerous images of deities
and attributes by which they are adorned, many of which are
still preserved in their original state. Further investigation
may perhaps establish Java and Sumatra, or rather the Malayan
ports (in which general term we may include all the
islands containing the Malayan Ports) as not only the <em>Taprobane</em>
or <em>Tapavana</em> of the ancients, but also the Sacred
Isles of the Hindus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Vol I Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The map of Java which accompanies this work has been
drawn principally from actual surveys, many of which were
made by order of the British Government on the island. The
first map of Java which was presented to the public, and
from which nearly all those, which have subsequently been
engraved, are copies, was published by Valentyn,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and
consists of seven sheets. As, at that period, little more was
known of the island by the Dutch than some parts of the
coast, the country in the immediate vicinity of their capital,
with perhaps the province of Bantam, the author had no
materials for making a map of the whole island, which could
pretend to much authority or value. Most of the land in the
immediate vicinity of Batavia having been sold to Europeans,
was of necessity surveyed, in order to ascertain the different
boundaries; but it was only a short time before the arrival of
Marshal Daendels, in 1808, that any steps appear to have
been taken by the local authorities, to procure correct statistical
and topographical information of the other more
important districts of the island. Something to this effect
was done during the administration of Mr. Engelhard, late
Governor of the North-east Coast, but it was only during the
government of the Marshal that these objects were pursued
with much energy or success.</p>

<p>At the period of the arrival of the English, topographical
surveys of <em>Semárang</em> and several of the eastern districts had
been completed; and although somewhat deficient in accuracy
of measurement and neatness of execution, yet as they
appeared sufficiently correct for many valuable purposes, and
as the Government was anxious to obtain, without loss of
time, a better acquaintance with the geography of the country,
it was determined to make some sacrifice of accuracy to the
considerations of economy and expedition, and to survey the
other districts upon the same plan. While these surveys were
in progress, the territorial interest which the European government
obtained in the central provinces, induced them to turn
their attention to the improvements of which the Solo River
might be susceptible. This river, the most considerable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Vol I Pg 7]</a></span>
the island, passes through <em>Súra-kérta</em>, the capital of the <em>Susuhúnan</em>,
or (as he is termed by Europeans) Emperor of Java,
and discharges itself into the sea near <em>Grésik</em>. An actual
survey was accordingly made by a British officer of experience,
particularly instructed to ascertain how far it might be
practicable to improve its navigation by the aid of artificial
cuts and dams.</p>

<p>A greater object soon called for more extensive measures.
When it was determined to introduce an entirely new system
of internal management, by the abolition of feudal service,
and the establishment of a more permanent property in the
soil, it was deemed essential that a detailed survey should be
made of the different districts successively, in which the new
system was to be introduced. This was intended to form the
basis of a general agricultural survey of the country, then
about to be made. In several of these districts this detailed
survey has been completed; and, with the exception of the
provinces still under native jurisdiction, and called Native
Provinces, nearly the whole of the land on Java, not in a state
of absolute forest, has been measured with more or less accuracy.
Of the native provinces but a very small part has been
actually surveyed; with regard to the rest, the materials from
which the present map is taken, were principally obtained
from observation made during occasional routes through them.
The southern division of Bantam being principally forest, has
not been actually surveyed; neither has the island of Madura
been yet surveyed by Europeans: the eastern part of it was
measured by the natives, and it was principally upon their
authority that the map now presented of that island was
drawn. The best charts of both the north and south coast
have been consulted. The three harbours of Wyn Coops Bay,
<em>Cheláchap</em>, and <em>Pachítan</em>, on the latter, are laid down from
actual survey, as well as the entrance to the harbour of <em>Surabáya</em>.
On the whole, therefore, although the map now
engraved is far from perfect, and of course suffers from the
reduction necessary to adapt it to the rest of the work, it is
presumed that it will aid the reader in most of the geographical
objects to which this volume will refer, and that its superiority
over those that have previously appeared is such as to justify
its publication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Vol I Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The length of Java, in a straight line drawn between its extreme
points, (Java Head, and the south-east point of the island)
is five hundred and seventy-five geographical, equal to six hundred
and sixty-six statute miles: its breadth varies from one
hundred and seventeen geographical, or one hundred and
thirty-five and a half statute miles (between the south-west
point of <em>Pachítan</em> bay and the north point of <em>Japára</em>) to forty-eight
geographical or fifty-six statute miles, (between the
mouth of the <em>Seráyu</em> river and the <em>Marabáya</em>, five degrees
east of <em>Tegál</em>);<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and it is estimated to contain an area of
about fifty thousand statute miles.</p>

<p>Numerous small islands are scattered in its immediate
vicinity, particularly along the northern coast, and contribute,
with the projecting points and headlands inclosing the different
bays, to form harbours of various capacities. The most
important of these islands is that of <em>Madúra</em>, which is separated
from the main land of Java by a strait in one part not
more than a mile broad, and serves to form the important
harbour of <em>Surabáya</em>. This island has the appearance of
being a continuation of the main land of Java, and having
been long subjected to the same political authority, has generally
formed one of the provinces of the Javan empire. In
length <em>Madúra</em> is about seventy-nine geographical, or ninety-one
and a half statute miles; and its narrowest part is about
twenty-seven geographical, or thirty-one and a quarter statute
miles. The small islands lying to the east of it are considered
as its dependencies.</p>

<p>The form of Java is chiefly remarkable for the rectangularity
of its outline, which is such that the island might be divided
into five or six parts, each a rectangular parallelogram drawn
by an unsteady hand. Its western and northern coasts abound
with bays and inlets. The outline of <em>Madúra</em> is more regular,
especially on the northern coast.</p>

<p>The coast from Bantam to the river <em>Chi-mánok</em>, about two
degrees in length on the north, is nearly parallel to that which
extends from Wyn Coops Bay to a point about twenty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Vol I Pg 9]</a></span>
west of <em>Núsa kambúng'an</em>, the breadth throughout being
about seventy-eight geographical miles; and from the same
point to the river <em>Manchíngan</em>, a distance of about one degree
and three-quarters, the coast is nearly parallel to that which
lies between <em>Chéribon</em> and <em>Semárang</em>, the breadth throughout
being about fifty-seven geographical miles. From the west
point of <em>Japára</em> to point <em>Pángka</em> on the north, distant from it
about two degrees, and along the corresponding coast on the
south, the average breadth is seventy-three geographical miles;
and from <em>Surabáya</em> to the north-east point of the island, distant
about one degree and a half, and along the south coast
opposite to it, the average breadth is forty-five geographical
miles.</p>

<p>At the time when Europeans first visited Java, the whole of
the island acknowledged the supremacy of one sovereign: but
there was a period in its history when it was nearly equally
divided under the independent administration of two powers,
one established in the eastern, and the other in the western
districts; and as there is a marked distinction between the
descendants of these two nations, the most general division of
the country is still into the western and eastern districts, to
the latter of which alone the term Java is applied by the
natives. They are separated by the river <em>Losári</em>, which forms
the boundary between <em>Chéribon</em> and <em>Brébes</em>: and all the
western, the northern, with a few of the inland districts and
the Island of <em>Madúra</em>, are under the immediate authority and
administration of the European government. The rest of the
island remains subject to the native princes, and on that
account is designated on the map and elsewhere, with more
regard to convenience than correctness of language, as the
Native Provinces.</p>

<p>The provinces under European authority have latterly been
divided into fifteen residencies, or separate administrations,
exclusive of the seat of government, which, as they will
be frequently referred to in the course of this work, it may be
convenient to notice in this place.</p>

<p>Commencing from the west, the province, or as it is usually
termed, the kingdom of Bantam (properly <em>Bántan</em>) occupies
the first place. This extensive province forms a large portion
of the island. It is washed on three sides by the sea. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Vol I Pg 10]</a></span>
east it joins with the environs and highlands of Batavia and
the district of <em>Chi-ánjur</em>, and on the west it is bounded by
the Straits of Sunda; and in this quarter comprises dependant
islands scattered along its shore, and the two harbours of
<em>Mew</em> and <em>Merák</em>, which, with other bays, deeply indent the
coast. Bantam, the native capital of this province, has been
latterly deserted by the European establishment for <em>Sírang</em>
(commonly called Ceram), an elevated and healthy station
about seven miles further inland.</p>

<p>Next in succession towards the east is the division of
Batavia, which comprises what formerly constituted the
native province of <em>Jákatra</em> or <em>Jokárta</em>. The northern part of
this division, towards the coast, includes the city of Batavia,
populous and important on account of its excellent roads for
shipping, its advantageous position for European commerce,
and as being the long established seat of the Dutch government,
but less fertile and healthy than the more eastern
provinces of the island.</p>

<p>South and east of the division of Batavia and its environs
lie what are termed by Europeans the Preanger (<em>Priáng'en</em>)
Regencies,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the central and southern districts of which,
stretching from Bantam to Chéribon, are extremely mountainous.
This extensive portion of the island, which now
includes a large part of Chéribon, consists of the districts
of <em>Kráwang</em>, <em>Chiásem</em>, <em>Pamanúkan</em>, <em>Kándang-aúr</em>, and
<em>Dramáyu</em> or <em>Indramáyu</em>, along the northern coast, and of the
inland and southern districts of <em>Chi-ánjur</em>, <em>Bándung</em>, <em>Súmedang</em>,
<em>Lim-báng'an</em>, and <em>Súka-púra</em>; the southern coast,
from the boundary of Bantam to that of Chéribon, being
included within the subdivisions of <em>Chi-ánjur</em>, and <em>Súka-púra</em>.</p>

<p>To the eastward of these districts, and crossing the island
from north to south, is the province of <em>Chéribon</em>, divided
into ten principal districts. To the south is the island of
<em>Núsa-kambáng'an</em> which forms the harbour of <em>Cheláchap</em>.</p>

<p>East of Chéribon, as before noticed, it is only the northern
and some of the inland districts, that are immediately subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Vol I Pg 11]</a></span>
to the European authority. These, during the British government
of the island, were comprised under the administrations
of <em>Tegúl</em>, <em>Pakalúng'an</em>, <em>Semárang</em>, <em>Japára</em>, and
<em>Rembáng</em>, which under the Dutch East-India Company constituted
what was termed the government of the <em>North-east
Coast</em>, the seat of which was at <em>Semárang</em>; and of <em>Grésik</em>,
<em>Surabáya</em>, <em>Pasúrúan</em>, <em>Bisúki</em>, and <em>Banyuwángi</em>, which, with
<em>Bankálang</em> and <em>Súmenap</em> on <em>Madúra</em>, constituted, under the
same authority, the division of the <em>Oost Hook</em>, or East Point
of the island, of which <em>Surabáya</em> was the principal station.
Inland of <em>Semárang</em> and <em>Pakalúngan</em>, and bounded by those
divisions, and by the provinces of the native princes, is situated
the rich and fertile district of <em>Kedú</em>, which, with the
more eastern districts of <em>Grobogan</em>, <em>Wirosári</em>, <em>Blóra</em>, <em>Jípang</em>,
<em>Jápan</em>, and <em>Wírasaba</em>, stretching inland from <em>Semárang</em> to
<em>Surabáya</em>, were ceded to the British government in the year
1812.</p>

<p>The capitals of all the northern districts bear the same
name with the districts themselves, and are generally situated
on small rivers at no great distance from the sea.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Native Provinces</span> are divided between two native
sovereigns: the <em>Susuhúnan</em>, or Emperor of Java, who resides
at <em>Súra-kérta</em>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> on the <em>Solo</em> River; and the Sultan, who
resides at <em>Yúg'ya-kérta</em>,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> near the south coast, in the province
of <em>Matárem</em>. These provinces comprise several of the richest
districts of the island, among which are <em>Bányumas</em>, <em>Rómo</em>,
<em>Bágalen</em>, and <em>Matárem</em>, to the west; and <em>Mádion</em>, <em>Jagarága</em>,
<em>Sukawáti</em>, <em>Pranarága</em>, <em>Kértasána</em>, <em>Blítar</em>, and <em>Kedíri</em>, to the
east; and with the exception of the small district of <em>Pachítan</em>,
which has been recently ceded to the European government,
occupy the whole of the southern coast from <em>Chéribon</em> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Vol I Pg 12]</a></span><em>Málang</em>, a distance of not less than two hundred and fifty
miles, and form about a fourth part of the whole island.</p>

<p>The districts near the coasts are generally separated from
each other by rivers; those in the interior often by ranges of
hills and mountains. The districts are again divided, each
subdivision including numerous villages.</p>

<p>The principal harbour of the island is that of <em>Surabáya</em> in
the eastern districts, formed by the approaching extremities of
Java and <em>Madúra</em>. It is broad and spacious, secure against
the violence of the sea and wind, and may be rendered impregnable
to any hostile attack.</p>

<p>The next in importance is that of Batavia, more properly,
perhaps, called the roads of Batavia, which are sheltered by
several islands lying in the outer part of the bay. These
roads, however, not admitting of any means of permanent
defence from the attack of a superior naval force, the Dutch
government, during the late war, were induced to fortify the
small harbour of <em>Merák</em> Bay, on the north-west coast of Bantam.</p>

<p>Along the northern coast, there are perhaps other positions
which admit of being improved into convenient harbours; but
where the whole coast affords excellent anchorage at nearly
all seasons of the year, and where vessels of any burthen can
approach all the principal stations, at a convenient distance
for the barter of their merchandize, the purposes of commerce
are in that respect already sufficiently provided for. The sea
being usually smooth, and the weather moderate, the native
vessels and small craft always find sufficient shelter at the
change of the monsoon, by running under some of the numerous
islands scattered along this coast, or passing up the
rivers, which, though in general difficult of entrance on account
of their bars, are for the most part navigable to such
vessels, as far up as the maritime capitals, through which they
run.</p>

<p>The south coast, on account of its exposure to the open
ocean, the consequent high swell or surf which breaks on it,
and its general want of good anchorage, is seldom visited by
shipping. But even here harbours may be found; and those
of <em>Cheláchap</em> and <em>Pachítan</em> might, no doubt, be frequented
with safety, were it considered desirable to attract commercial
adventurers to this side of the island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Vol I Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing from the coast to the interior of the country, the
stranger cannot fail to be struck with the bold outline and
prominent features of its scenery. An uninterrupted series or
range of large mountains, varying in their elevation above the
sea from five to eleven, and even twelve thousand feet,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
exhibiting, by their round base or pointed tops, their volcanic
origin, extend through the whole length of the island.</p>

<p>The first of this series, commencing from the westward, is
in Bantam. This mountain (<em>Gûnung-kárang</em>), though of
moderate elevation compared with others on the island,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
is seen at a considerable distance from sea, and is a well
known landmark to mariners. It lies due south of the town
of Bantam, at a considerable distance from the sea.</p>

<p>The next mountain of the series is the <em>Salák</em>, the eastern
foot of which is connected with the <em>Gedé</em> or <em>Panarang'o</em>,
situated about fifty miles south of Batavia. These two mountains
are seen from the roads of Batavia, and, from the appearance
they exhibit, are usually termed by mariners the Blue
Mountains.</p>

<p>From the eastern part of the <em>Gedé</em>, the volcanic series separates
into two independent branches, one of which inclines to
the south; the other proceeds almost due east, slightly verging
to the north. The former breaks into an irregular transverse
range, which extends across the island, till it approaches the
northern branch, from whence the general series is continued
in an easterly direction as far as the mountain <em>Sindóro</em>, the
western of the two mountains known by mariners as the Two
Brothers. The mountain <em>Súmbing</em>, or <em>Sindári</em> (the second of
The Brothers), is somewhat further to the south.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the eastern foot of the mountain
<em>Súmbing</em> are three large volcanos, in a direction almost north
and south, dividing the large series transversely; these are
the mountains <em>Ung'árang</em>, <em>Merbábu</em>, and <em>Merápi</em>. The next
volcano, in an eastern direction, is that of <em>Japára</em>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Vol I Pg 14]</a></span>deviates more than any other from the regular series, and
forms a peculiar peninsular appendage to the island. The
series is then continued in an easterly course from the <em>Merápi</em>
as far as the mountain <em>Telágawúrung</em>, which is in contact
with the ocean at the eastern end of the island.</p>

<p>The several large mountains comprised in this series, and
which are in number thirty-eight, though different from each
other in external figure, agree in the general attribute of volcanos,
having a broad base gradually verging towards the
summit in the form of a cone.</p>

<p>They all rise from a plain but little elevated above the level
of the sea, and each must, with very few exceptions, be considered
as a separate mountain, raised by a cause independent
of that which produced the others. Most of them have been
formed at a very remote period, and are covered by the vegetation
of many ages; but the indications and remains of their
former irruptions are numerous and unequivocal. The craters
of several are completely extinct; those of others contain
small apertures, which continually discharge sulphureous
vapours or smoke. Many of them have had irruptions during
late years.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Vol I Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the mountains of the larger series above described,
there are extensive ranges of mountains of an inferior elevation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Vol I Pg 16]</a></span>sometimes connected with the larger series, and sometimes
independent of them, which are also for the most part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Vol I Pg 17]</a></span>volcanic. Numerous ridges of hills traverse the country in
various directions, and the surface of the island in general,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Vol I Pg 18]</a></span>independently of these more striking features, is in most parts
undulating and uneven, except on the sea coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Vol I Pg 19]</a></span>
A country which abounds in mountains is seldom deficient
in rivers; accordingly, no region is perhaps better watered.
Java is singularly favoured in the number of its streams. The
size of the island does not admit of the formation of large
rivers, but there are probably fifty, that in the wet season,
bear down rafts charged with timber and other rough produce
of the country, and not less than five or six at all times
navigable to the distance of some miles from the coast. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Vol I Pg 20]</a></span>would be vain to attempt numbering those which are precious
to the agriculturist; they are many hundreds, if not thousands.</p>

<p>The largest, and most important river on the island, is that
of <em>Sólo</em>, or as it is termed by the natives, <em>Beng'áwan</em> (the great)
<em>Sólo</em>, which takes its rise in the district of <em>Kadáwang</em>, and
after collecting the waters of the surrounding hills, becomes a
stream of considerable depth and breadth at <em>Súra-kérta</em>, where
it is further increased by the waters collected from the adjacent
districts. Its general course from the capital is in an east-north-easterly
direction, till it discharges itself by two principal
outlets into the sea, near <em>Grésik</em> and <em>Sidáyu</em>. After leaving
<em>Matárem</em>, it traverses the provinces of <em>Sukawáti</em>, <em>Jagarága</em>,
<em>Mádion</em>, <em>Jípang</em>, <em>Blóra</em>, <em>Túban</em>, <em>Sidáyu</em>, and <em>Grésik</em>.</p>

<p>At <em>Awi</em>, near the boundary of <em>Mádion</em> and <em>Jagarága</em>, on the
eastern side of the river, a large branch from the south-eastern
provinces, commonly called the river of <em>Mádion</em>, unites itself
with that of <em>Sólo</em>, and from hence its course, which in various
places has been rapid, and in a few places impeded with rocks,
is calm, regular, and steady to its discharge. It has been estimated,
that the extent of the windings of this river is not less
than three hundred and fifty-six English miles, from <em>Súra-kérta</em>
to <em>Grésik</em>, which in the chart only gives a straight line
of one hundred and forty English miles, and during its whole
course no serious impediment appears to its navigation.</p>

<p>This river is of great importance to the inland trade of many
of the eastern provinces. During the rainy season, boats of
considerable size convey the produce of an extensive tract of
country to the sea; and, except during the months of August,
September, and October, and in seasons uncommonly dry, it
bears down boats of middling or small size during the whole
year, from a considerable distance above <em>Súra-kérta</em>. The
boats employed in the navigation of the river are of very
different sizes, and of a peculiar construction: they are very
long in proportion to their breadth, have flat bottoms, and
draw very little water. Those generally used in conveying
the produce from one village to another in the vicinity of
<em>Súra-kérta</em>, carry only a few tons, and have a temporary
covering of straw mats, or <em>kájang</em>; others, more carefully
constructed, have a regular roof of planks and a chamber or
cabin which can be closed, and convey from fifty to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Vol I Pg 21]</a></span>
hundred tons. These are generally used by individuals in
their adventures to <em>Grésik</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>. The largest, which
are the property of the prince, load nearly two hundred tons.
They are employed in transporting the produce of several of
the interior provinces, consisting chiefly of pepper and coffee,
to <em>Grésik</em>, and return laden with salt and foreign merchandize
for the consumption of the interior. They require a considerable
depth of water, and can only pass when the river is
swollen by continued rains. They mostly depart from <em>Súra-kérta</em>
in the month of January. Their course down the river
is rapid: they generally arrive at <em>Grésik</em> in eight days; but
they can perform but one voyage in a season, as they require
nearly four months to work up the stream.</p>

<p>The river of <em>Surabáya</em>, the second in magnitude of the
whole island, rises near <em>Bátu</em>, in the vicinity of the southern
hills of the mountain <em>Arjúna</em>. It is near its source called
<em>Káli-brántas</em>. Near the capital of <em>Málang</em> it receives two
streams from the eastward. There it first takes its course
through the most southern provinces of the island, when winding
round the mountain <em>Káwi</em> it returns again to the north,
receiving near its curvature numerous augmentations from the
southern ridge of mountains. The chief of these is the <em>Lésti</em>,
a considerable river coming from the east, which joins it near
the boundary of <em>Málang</em> and <em>Seríng'at</em>. Continuing its course
in a northern direction, it traverses the provinces of <em>Rówo</em> and
<em>Kedíri</em>, being joined on the way by the river <em>Rówo</em>: here it
attains its utmost magnitude, and is distinguished by the name
of <em>Beng'áwan Kedíri</em>. From the capital of this district to its
mouths, it is navigable for boats of very considerable size, and
its course is steady and uninterrupted. Having crossed the
district of <em>Wirasába</em> and <em>Jápan</em>, it enters that of <em>Surabáya</em>.
It discharges itself into the ocean by five outlets, which form
as many separate rivers. The first of them, taking an easterly
course, is called the river <em>Púnong</em>: then follow those of
<em>Tang'goláng'ing</em>, <em>Sído-kéri</em>, <em>Kedóng</em>, and lastly of <em>Wóno-króno</em>,
which again subdividing sends off the branch which passes
<em>Surabáya</em>.</p>

<p>Several smaller rivers, which fall into the sea between <em>Semárang</em>
and <em>Lásem</em>, are highly important for the conveyance
of teak timber from the central forests to the coast; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Vol I Pg 22]</a></span>
waters from some of them being directed into canals, particularly
through the low district of <em>Demák</em>, tend considerably to
increase the inland navigation of the country.</p>

<p>In the western districts, the principal rivers which discharge
themselves into the sea on the northern coast are the <em>Chikándi</em>,
which forms the present boundary between Bantam
and the environs of Batavia; the <em>Chi-dáni</em>, which discharges
itself below <em>Táng'ran</em>; the <em>Chi-tárom</em>, which falls into the
sea below <em>Kráwang</em>; and the <em>Chi-mánok</em>, which forms the
present boundary between <em>Dramáyu</em> and <em>Chéribon</em>. The
principal rivers which discharge themselves by the south coast
are the <em>Chi-mandíri</em>, which falls into the sea at <em>Palábuan-rátu</em>,
or Wyn Coops Bay; the <em>Chi-tándui</em>, which disembogues
near <em>Núsa-kambáng'an</em>; and the <em>Seráyu</em>, which taking its
rise in the mountain <em>Díeng</em> or <em>Práhu</em>, traverses the rich districts
of <em>Bányumas</em>, and falls into the sea a short distance to
the east of <em>Cheláchap</em>; but these rivers, though of considerable
depth, are choked up at their mouths by heavy banks or
bars, and in consequence of the heavy surf which constantly
breaks on the southern coast, are dangerous at their entrance.</p>

<p>Along the northern coast, almost every district has its principal
river, and most of them are navigable up to the maritime
capitals for native vessels of considerable burthen; but they
all have the disadvantage of being partially blocked up at
their discharge by extensive bars and mud banks, an evil
which is extending with the increase of agriculture, by reason
of the quantify of soil necessarily washed down in the process
of irrigating the land for the rice cultivation. Most of them
require the application of jetties or piers to deepen the passages
at their entrance.</p>

<p>There are no lakes of any considerable size on Java, for
that name cannot be given to the <em>ráwas</em>, or swamps, which
though swelled to a considerable size in the wet season, are
for the rest of the year either dried up or choked by vegetation.
Of this description are two extensive tracts; one inland of
<em>Japára</em>, usually termed by the Dutch the <em>Binnen Zee</em>, or
inland sea; and another in the district of <em>Semárang</em>. In
<em>Báglen</em> also (one of the native provinces on the southern side
of the island) there is a lake which supplies the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Vol I Pg 23]</a></span>
country with fish, and along the coast of which a traffic is
carried on in boats.</p>

<p>Extensive swamps are also found in some parts of the native
provinces, and in the mountainous districts of the <em>Súnda</em>
country. Several very beautiful lakes, of small dimensions,
are discovered among the hills, and some of them can evidently
be shown to have been formed of the craters of extinct
volcanos.</p>

<p>The general aspect of Java on the northern coast is low, in
many places swampy and overgrown with mangrove trees and
bushes, particularly towards the west. The southern coast,
on the contrary, consists almost entirely of a series of rocks
and cliffs, which rise perpendicularly to a considerable height.
In the interior, stupendous mountains stretch longitudinally
throughout the island, while others of an inferior elevation,
and innumerable ranges of hills running in various directions,
serve to form and confine plains and valleys of various elevations
and extent. On the northern side, the ascent is in
general very gradual, from the sea-coast to the immediate
base of the mountains; particularly in the western parts of the
island, where it has the greatest breadth, and where the
mountains are situated far inland. In approaching the mountains,
which lie at the back of Batavia, there is a gradual but
almost imperceptible acclivity for about forty miles. In other
parts, where the mountains and hills approach nearer to the
coast, the ascent is of course more abrupt, as may be observed
in the vicinity of <em>Semárang</em>.</p>

<p>Although the northern coast is in many parts flat and uninteresting,
the interior and southern provinces, from the mountainous
character of the country, may be reckoned amongst the
most romantic and highly diversified in the world; uniting all
the rich and magnificent scenery, which waving forests, never-failing
streams, and constant verdure can present, heightened
by a pure atmosphere and the glowing tints of a tropical sun.</p>

<p>The largest of the elevated plains are; in the west, that of
<em>Bándung</em>, formed between the two ranges of volcanos which
branch off from the foot of the mountain <em>Gedé</em>; and in the east,
those usually termed the plains of <em>Sólo</em> and <em>Kedíri</em>, which extend
along the central districts from the <em>Merápi</em> to <em>Kedíri</em> and
the site of the ancient capital of <em>Mejapáhit</em>. These are of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Vol I Pg 24]</a></span>siderable
magnitude, and with the exception of the valley
of <em>Kedú</em> and the province of <em>Bányumas</em>, through which the
beautiful river of <em>Seráyu</em> bends its winding and romantic
course, are perhaps the richest parts of the island. The low-lands,
however, are not without their claims to that distinction;
especially the flats of <em>Demák</em>, once an extensive swamp,
and the Delta of <em>Surabáya</em>. Large tracts, particularly in the
mountainous ranges of the western districts, still remain in a
state of nature, or where the ground has been once cleared of
forest, are now overrun with long and rank grass. In the
central and eastern districts, the country is comparatively well
clothed with cultivation.</p>

<p>Quitting the low coast of the north, in many parts unhealthy,
the traveller can hardly advance five miles inland without
feeling a sensible improvement in the atmosphere and climate.
As he proceeds, at every step he breathes a purer air and
surveys a brighter scene. At length he reaches the highlands.
Here the boldest forms of nature are tempered by the
rural arts of man: stupendous mountains clothed with abundant
harvest, impetuous cataracts tamed to the peasant's will.
Here is perpetual verdure; here are tints of the brightest
hue. In the hottest season, the air retains its freshness; in
the driest, the innumerable rills and rivulets preserve much of
their water. This the mountain farmer directs in endless
conduits and canals to irrigate the land, which he has laid
out in terraces for its reception; it then descends to the
plains, and spreads fertility wherever it flows, till at last, by
numerous outlets, it discharges itself into the sea.</p>

<p>Almost all the mountains or volcanos, in the large series
before noticed, are found on examination to have the same
general constitution: they are striped vertically by sharp
ridges, which, as they approach the foot of the mountain, take
a more winding course. These ridges alternate with valleys,
whose sides are of a very various declivity. Large rocks of
basaltes occasionally project, and in several instances the
valleys form the beds of rivers towards the tops of the
volcanos; in the rainy season they all convey large volumes
of water.</p>

<p>Next in importance to this extensive series of primary
mountains, there are various ridges of smaller mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Vol I Pg 25]</a></span>
or hills, extending in different directions, with nearly an equal
degree of elevation; sometimes originating from or connected
with the primary volcanos, sometimes forming independent
ranges, and arising separately and at a distance from the great
series. These, which have been termed secondary mountains,
though evidently of a volcanic nature, differ in many particulars
of their constitution from those of the larger series.
They generally extend in long narrow ridges, with but a
moderate elevation, and their sides are less regularly composed
of the vertical ridges above mentioned. In most cases, a
stratified structure and submarine origin may be discovered.
They are generally covered with large rocks of basaltes; and
in some instances they consist of wacken and hornblende,
which is found along their base in immense piles.</p>

<p>Hills of calcareous constitution, with only a moderate degree
of elevation, occur in smaller ridges, often with a flat or
tabular top; or in steep rocks and eminences. These are
sometimes found in the centre of the island, covering the
volcanic districts, but much more frequently near the northern
and southern shores.</p>

<p>Hills of a mixed nature, partly calcareous and partly volcanic,
are also found. The southern coast of the island
consists almost entirely of them, rising in many places to the
perpendicular height of eighty or one hundred feet, and sometimes
much higher. These, as they branch inward and approach
the central or higher districts, gradually disappear,
and give place to the volcanic series, or alternate with huge
masses of basaltic hornblende, that appears to assume a
regular stratification. At the base of these, or in the beds of
the rivers which proceed from them, are frequently found
various silicious stones, as common flints, prase, hornstone,
jasper, porphyry, agate, cornelian, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Alluvial districts, evidently of recent origin, are noticed in
several parts of the island. These are formed from the sediment
and near the discharge of large rivers, and at the borders
of the calcareous ridges, which are in many instances partially
covered by them: their boundary can easily be traced, and
most of them are still in a state of constant progression.
Among other phenomena are mineral wells of various temperature
and impregnation; wells of naphtha, or petroleum;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Vol I Pg 26]</a></span>
and rivers arising, in a few instances, from the craters of volcanos,
impregnated with sulphureous acid<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Vol I Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>From these, and all other investigations yet made, the constitution
of Java appears to be exclusively volcanic. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Vol I Pg 28]</a></span>the vast Asiatic chain of mountains, one branch of which
terminates in Ceylon, proceeds another, which traversing
Arakan, Pegu, and the Malayan peninsula, extends to Sumatra,
<em>Bánka</em>, and <em>Bíliton</em>, where it may be said to disappear.
On Java no granite has been discovered. In its constitution,
as in its direction, it may be considered as the first of a series
of volcanic islands, which extend nearly eastward from the
Straits of Sunda for about twenty-five degrees.</p>

<p>At what period the island assumed its present shape, or
whether it was once joined to Sumatra and <em>Báli</em>, is matter
for conjecture. The violent convulsions which these islands
have so often suffered, justify a conclusion that the face of the
country has been frequently changed, and tradition mentions
the periods when Java was separated from those islands;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Vol I Pg 29]</a></span>but the essential difference which has been found in the
mineralogical constitution of Java and Sumatra, would seem
to indicate a different origin, and to support the opinion that
those two islands were never united. Whether, at a period
more remote, the whole Archipelago formed part of the
continent of Asia, and was divided from it and shattered into
islands; whether they were originally distinct from the main
land, or whether they were formed at the same time, or subsequently,
are questions we cannot resolve. Yet, when we
reflect on the violence of those dreadful phenomena<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Vol I Pg 30]</a></span>have occurred in our own times in the smaller islands of the
volcanic series, and view this range, as it is now presented to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Vol I Pg 31]</a></span>us on the map of the world, a conjecture might perhaps be
hazarded, that the whole may have once formed but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Vol I Pg 32]</a></span>southern side of one large island or continent, within which
much of the main land has fallen in, and subsequently disappeared
on the influx of the sea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Vol I Pg 33]</a></span>
The constitution of the island is unfavourable to metals.
All the examinations hitherto made confirm this assertion,
and it may be laid down as a general position, that no metals
occur, in such a quantity, or with such richness of ore, as to
reward the operations of the miner. The only notice we have
of the existence of gold or silver is contained in the first volume
of the Transactions of the Batavian Society; and the
attempts on the mountain of <em>Párang</em>, in 1723, and on the
<em>Mégeméndung</em>, in 1744, were soon abandoned. Iron pyrites
is found in small quantity in several districts, as well as red-ochre;
which, however, often contains so little iron, as scarcely
to serve for the common purpose of paint. The existence of
mercury in the low lands of <em>Démak</em>, where it is distributed in
minute particles through the clay of the rice-grounds bounding
one of the principal rivers of that district, has not been
considered as an indication of a mine, or of the ores of that
metal.</p>

<p>No diamonds are found, nor other precious stones, but many
minerals of the schorl, quartz, potstone, feldspar, and trap kind.
They mostly exist in mountains of secondary elevation, towards
the southern shores of the island, sometimes in extensive veins;
but separate fragments are carried down by the rivers, and
found far from their original deposition. Prase is found in very
extensive veins; hornstone is also abundant in particular situations,
as well as flint, chalcedony, hyalite, common jasper, jasper-agate,
obsidian, and porphyry.</p>

<p>The soil in Java is for the most part rich, and remarkable for
its depth; probably owing to the exclusively volcanic constitution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Vol I Pg 34]</a></span>of the country, and the constant accession of new mould,
which is washed down the side of its numerous mountains. It
has the character of being in a high degree richer than the ordinary
soil of the Malayan countries in general, particularly of
Sumatra and the Malayan peninsula. The best soil resembles
the richest garden-mould of Europe; and whenever it can be
exposed to the inundation necessary for the rice crop, requires
no manure, and will bear without impoverishment, one heavy
and one light crop in the year: the poorest, with this advantage,
will yield a liberal return to the husbandman. In an island
of such extent and variety of surface, the soil is necessarily various,
but its general character is that of extraordinary fertility.
The red and very light soil of the western districts is generally
considered inferior to the dark brown and stiffer soil which prevails
in the eastern. The best soil is usually found near the
beds of rivers, in the valleys, and on the slopes of the largest
mountains: the worst on the ranges of low calcareous hills,
which run through different parts of the island.</p>

<p>The seasons, in all the countries situated within about ten
degrees of the equator, agree in this: that as one eternal summer
prevails, they are not distinguished as hot and cold, but as
wet and dry. On Java the seasons depend upon the periodical
winds. The period of the setting in of these winds is not determined
within a few weeks; but generally the westerly winds,
which are always attended with rain, are felt in October, become
more steady in November and December, and gradually subside,
till in March or April they are succeeded by the easterly
winds and fair weather, which continue for the remaining half
year. The heaviest rains are in the months of December and
January, and the driest weather is in July and August; at which
latter period, also, the nights are coldest and the days hottest.
The weather is most unsettled when the season is changing,
particularly at the first setting in of the westerly winds: but
those violent storms and hurricanes, which are so often felt in
the West Indies and in higher latitudes, are here unknown. With
the exception of a few days at these periods, or when the westerly
winds are at their height, vessels of any description may
ride in safety in most of the bays along the northern coast of
the island; and on shore, the wind is never so violent as to do
damage. Thunder-storms are, however, frequent, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Vol I Pg 35]</a></span>
lightning is extremely vivid. In the vicinity of the hills,
and elsewhere during the dry season, seldom a day passes without
thunder and lightning; and although these grand exhibitions
of nature cause less consternation in general within the
tropics than beyond them, it cannot be denied that they are destructive
of many lives. Earthquakes are to be expected in a
volcanic country, and are frequent in the vicinity of the volcanos;
but the European towns have never sustained any serious
injury from them.</p>

<p>During the rainy season there are many days free from
showers. The mornings are generally clear, and although the
rains sometimes continue without intermission for several days,
and frequently fall in torrents, they are not marked on Java by
that decided character, either of permanence or violence, which
distinguishes the periodical rains of the continent of India;
neither is the dry season distinguished by that excessive aridity
which attends the hot seasons of that country. Even in July
and August, the atmosphere is refreshed by occasional showers,
and the landscape is at all times of the year covered with the
brightest verdure. The thermometer of Fahrenheit has been
known to rise along the northern coast as high as 90° about three
in the afternoon, and even higher, particularly in the large and
low capitals of Batavia, <em>Semárang</em>, and <em>Surabáya</em>; but from
observations made during a course of some years at Batavia, and
published under the authority of the Dutch government, it has
been found usually to range between 70 and 74° in the evenings
and mornings, and to stand about 83° at noon. By similar observations
at <em>Semárang</em>, the same thermometer, placed in a spacious
and open apartment, has averaged 87½° at noon.</p>

<p>At a distance inland of not more than thirty or forty miles,
where the ascent is gradual, and of fifteen or twenty or less
where it is rapid, the thermometer falls from five to ten degrees
lower. At <em>Chi-serúa</em>, situated about 40 miles inland of Batavia,
and <em>Chi-pánas</em>, about twelve miles further, on the opposite
slope of the mountain <em>Gedé</em>, the thermometer ranges generally
between 60 and 70°. In the morning, at six o'clock, it is sometimes
as low as 57°; and in the afternoon, at three, its usual
height is from 67 to 70°, but seldom rising to 72°. On some of
the hills inland of <em>Semárang</em>, on which Europeans frequently
reside during the dry season, at an elevation of about four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Vol I Pg 36]</a></span>
thousand feet, the thermometer is frequently seen as low as
45°, and generally, in the clear season, ranges from 50 to 62°,
and on the summit of one of the mountains (<em>Sindóro</em>) it has
been observed as low as 27°<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. Ice, as thick as a Spanish
dollar, has been found; and hoar-frost, denominated <em>bóhon
úpas</em>, or the poisonous dew, has been observed on the trees and
vegetation of some of the higher regions.</p>

<p>By its insular situation, the climate of Java enjoys the benefit
of land and sea breezes, which in its least favoured parts
subdue the fierceness of the tropical rays, while the great elevation
of its interior affords the rare advantage, that from the
sea-shore up to the tops of the mountains, there is, almost from
one end of the island to the other, a regular diminution of the
temperature, at the rate of two or three degrees of Fahrenheit
for every ten miles.</p>

<p>The general inference which has been drawn by professional
men, from the experience which the occupation of Java by the
British has afforded, is, that with the exception of the town of
Batavia, and some parts of the northern coast, the island of
Java stands on a level, in point of salubrity, with the healthiest
parts of British India, or of any tropical country in the world.</p>

<p>The principal stations of the British army, composed of
Europeans and Sepoys, were at Weltevreden, within three
miles of the town of Batavia, and at <em>Semárang</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>,
spots certainly less favourable to health than the rest of the
island taken generally; but detachments from it have occasionally
done duty in every district of the island.</p>

<p>The tables included in the Appendix<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, will shew, that notwithstanding
the troops laboured under many disadvantages
and privations, in point of accommodation, &amp;c. to which they
would not have been subjected in a more permanent settlement,
and that they were otherwise exposed to diseases unconnected
with those of the climate, the average casualties were
not excessive. From the 1st November, 1813, to the same
month in 1814, the average number of troops is stated to have
been 7,470, the deaths 504, making a proportion of 1 to 14-8:
the average number of sick in the same period was 862, making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Vol I Pg 37]</a></span>a proportion of sick to well as 1 to 8. From the beginning of
November 1814 to the same month in 1815, out of an average
number of troops stationed in different parts of the island, in
corps and detachments, amounting to 7,487, there were 252
deaths, 63 of which were caused by fever, 123 by dysentery,
and 65 by other diseases, making an average number of deaths
of 21 per month, or in the proportion of one death to thirty men
in the year, a proportion not exceeding that of some of the
healthiest possessions in temperate climates.</p>

<p>To this general result may be added the comparative casualties
in his Majesty's 78th regiment, during the period of its
being stationed in India and Java. This regiment has occasionally
been cantoned at each of the principal stations, and
has remained on the island from the first conquest of Java. By
the table will be seen the number of rank and file of which this
regiment consisted at different periods, since 1797 to 1815, and
the number of casualties in the same periods. It might not be
proper to select the years in which it landed on the continent of
India or on Java; but those in which it was stationed in either
country may be brought together, as fit subjects for comparison.
By calculation, upon the data of the table, it will appear, that
from December 1800 to December 1801, the deaths were to the
number of troops as 1 to about 20½; in 1801-2, as 1 to 12; in
1803-4, as 1 to 5¼; in 1804-5, as 1 to 8½; in 1805, as 1 to about
20; in 1806-7, as 1 to 28 nearly; in 1807-8, as 1 to 24½; in
1809-10, as 1 to about 23; in 1811-12, as 1 to 3¾; in 1813-14,
as 1 to 6; and in 1814-15, as 1 to about 20 nearly. The places
at which the regiment was stationed at these different periods
will be seen by the table; and the cause of the unusual mortality
that prevailed in 1811-12, and which exceeds any of the years
on the continent, will be found in an extract from the letter of
Dr. Currie, the surgeon, inclosing the return. The mortality in
the last year was as 1 to 20 in the regiment, and among the whole
troops, according to the data above, as 1 to about 30; a low
estimate for climates, whose characters stand higher for salubrity
than that of Java.</p>

<p>That the climate of Java, in general, is congenial to the
human frame, at least to that of an Asiatic, is corroborated by
the great extent of its native population, compared with that
of the surrounding islands, notwithstanding the checks which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Vol I Pg 38]</a></span>
it experienced both from the native princes and the European
government; and the convincing proof which the records of
the British army now afford, are perhaps sufficient to remove
the unfavourable impression which existed against the climate
of the island, as affecting Europeans.</p>

<p>At the same time, however, that Java has to boast this
general character of high salubrity, comparatively with other
tropical climates, it is not to be denied that there are some
spots upon it which are decidedly unhealthy. These are to be
found along the low swampy marshes of the northern coast,
which are mostly recent encroachments upon the sea: the
principal of these is Batavia, the long established capital of
the Dutch eastern empire.</p>

<p>The climate of this city has ever been considered as one of
the most baneful in the world. It has even been designated
the storehouse of disease; with how much justice, is too woefully
demonstrated by the writings of those visitors who have
survived its perils, and the records of the Dutch East-India
Company itself. If we may credit Raynal,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> there perished
between the years 1714 and 1776, in the hospitals of Batavia,
above eighty-seven thousand sailors and soldiers. From the
table, No. 1, imperfect as it is, on account of the loss of many
of the registers at the period of the British conquest, it will
be seen what a large proportion the deaths bore to the whole
population; and from the table, No. 2, of the same Appendix,
discovered among the Dutch records, it appears further, that
the total amount of deaths in this city, from the year 1730
to the year 1752, was in twenty-two years more than a million
of souls.</p>

<p>To those who are acquainted with the manner in which the
affairs of the Dutch East-India Company were managed
abroad, there will perhaps be no difficulty in laying rather
at the door of the colonists, than of the nation, the crime of
maintaining a commercial monopoly, at such a dreadful expence
of lives as resulted from confining the European population
within the narrow walls of this unhealthy city. That
the sacrifice was made for that object, or to speak more correctly,
under that pretext, for the private interests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Vol I Pg 39]</a></span>
colonists who were entrusted with its details, can scarcely be
doubted. From the moment the walls of the city were demolished,
the draw-bridges let down, and free egress and
ingress to and from the country was permitted, the population
began to migrate to a more healthy spot, and they had not to
go above one or two miles beyond the precincts before they
found themselves in a different climate. But this indulgence,
as it gave the inhabitants a purer air, so it gave them a clearer
insight into the resources of the country, and notions of a freer
commerce, which, of all things, it was the object of the local
government and its officers to limit or suppress.</p>

<p>Necessity might have first determined the choice of the
spot for the European capital; but a perseverance in the policy
of confining the European population within its walls,
after so many direful warnings of its insalubrity, cannot but
lead to the inference, that either the monopoly of the trade
was considered a greater object to the nation than the lives
of the inhabitants, or that the more liberal views of the government
were defeated by the weakness or corruption of its
agents.</p>

<p>Of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, as of the mineral,
we shall content ourselves with such an account as may be
necessary to convey to the reader a general notion of the
nature of the country and its resources, referring the man of
science to the intended publication of Dr. Thomas Horsfield,
a gentleman whose sole attention has, for the last seven years,
been directed to the natural history of Java.</p>

<p>Java is distinguished not only by the abundance of its
vegetation, but by its extraordinary variety. Upwards of a
thousand plants are already contained in the herb-area of
Dr. Horsfield, of which a large proportion are new to the
naturalist. Between the tops of the mountains and the sea-shore,
Java may be considered as possessing at least six
distinct climates, each furnishing a copious indigenous botany,
while the productions of every region in the world may find a
congenial spot somewhere in the island.</p>

<p>Vegetable productions, which contribute to the food and
sustenance of man, are found in great variety. Of these the
most important is rice, which forms the staple grain of the
country, and of which there are upwards of a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Vol I Pg 40]</a></span>
varieties. Maize, or Indian corn, ranks next, and is principally
cultivated in the higher regions, or in those tracts
where the soil is unfavourable to the rice cultivation. The
bean, or <em>káchang</em>, of which there are many varieties, is an important
article of food. Of the sugar-cane, which is used by
the natives only in its raw state, they distinguish eight
varieties, an account of which, as well as of the cultivation of
coffee, pepper, indigo, tobacco, &amp;c. will be found in the
chapter on agriculture. Aniseed, <em>múngsi</em>, cummin-seed,
<em>márícha</em> (black pepper), <em>chábi jáwa</em> (long pepper), <em>kumúkus</em>
(cubebs), socha dolichos, and <em>mendéking</em>, plants of considerable
importance, may be considered as indigenous to the island,
and are collected for various uses in diet and medicine.</p>

<p>Besides the cocoa-nut and other productions more generally
known, there are many trees growing spontaneously, of which
the seeds and kernels are used as food; the principal of these
are the <em>peté</em>, <em>jéngkol</em>, and <em>kómlandíngan</em>, several species of the
mimosa, and the <em>púchang</em> and <em>kamíri</em>. The bread-fruit tree
grows on Java, and is of the same species (although inferior in
quality) with that of the South Sea Islands: but the fruit is
comparatively very little esteemed or employed as an article
of food.</p>

<p>Of tuberous roots, besides those furnished from the principal
genera, convolvulus, dioscorea, and arum, are those from the
<em>bangkwang</em> (dolichos bulbosus), the roots of which are much
esteemed by the natives, and the <em>kéntang jáwa</em> (ocymum
tuberosum) or Java potatoe. Most of the numerous varieties
of the convolvulus and dioscorea, which furnish food for the
natives, have been enumerated in one of the first volumes of
the Batavian Transactions. The jatropha manihot, called
<em>úwi blanda</em>, or <em>wúdo</em>, has been propagated through all parts
of Java, and is found growing in the hedges.</p>

<p>The true sago of Amboina and the Eastern Islands, is found
only solitary in a few low and marshy situations, and the preparation
of it from the pith of the tree is not known to the
inhabitants of Java: the leaves only are employed for covering
houses; but from the <em>áren</em>, or sagurus rumphii, which grows
abundantly in every part of the island, and on account of its
variously extensive uses, ranks next in importance to the
cocoa-nut, a substance is prepared, similar in all respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Vol I Pg 41]</a></span>
to the true sago of the Eastern Islands. The tops of various
trees of the palm kind, which are sought after in other parts
of the East as food, are, on account of the abundance of rice
and other esculent vegetables, but little regarded in Java; but
the young shoots of many varieties of the <em>bambu</em> are used in
the diet of the natives. Wheat and potatoes, with almost every
species of European vegetables, are cultivated with success.
Of the oil-giving plants a particular account will be given
when describing the agriculture of the country.</p>

<p>Java, in common with the Malayan islands in general,
abounds in indigenous fruits. "No region of the earth,"
observes Mr. Marsden, "can boast an equal abundance and
variety of indigenous fruits." The <em>mangústin</em>, which on
account of its acknowledged pre-eminence amongst Indian
fruits, has been termed the pride of these countries; the
<em>durian</em>, or <em>dúren</em>, to which the natives of these islands are so
passionately attached; the <em>rámbutan</em>, the <em>lánseh</em> or <em>lánseb</em>,
with an extensive variety of the jack, the mango, the plantain,
the guava, the pine-apple, the papaw, the custard-apple,
the pomegranate, and almost every species of fruit which
grows within the tropics, are here found in the greatest variety.
The tamarind tree is general. The island also produces many
kinds of oranges, citrons, lemons, and in particular the pumplemous
(known in Bengal under the name of the Batavian
lembu, or lime, and in the West Indies as the shaddock),
besides the <em>sáwu</em>, <em>klédung</em>, <em>pachítan</em>, and a variety of others,
not generally known to Europeans, but well calculated for the
table. Of the mango, at least forty varieties are enumerated;
the wild raspberry, which is found in the higher regions, is
not destitute of flavour; one kind, in particular, with dark
violet-coloured fruit, approaches in taste to the European
species. In some of the mountainous tracts are to be found
peaches, Chinese pears, and some other fruits imported from
Japan, the Cape of Good Hope, and China.</p>

<p>Among innumerable flowers which bloom in perpetual succession
throughout the year, and impregnate the air of these
countries with their fragrance, those of the <em>champáka</em>, <em>tán-jong</em>,
<em>meláti</em>, <em>kanáng'a</em> and <em>nágasári</em>, hold the first rank;
they are used by the natives in the ornament of their persons,
and are remarkable for their fragrance. The myrtle and rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Vol I Pg 42]</a></span>
are found in the gardens of Europeans. A great variety
of ornamental trees and shrubs, many of them overlooked in
the catalogues of Rhumphius and Van Rheede, have been
noticed, as deserving cultivation for their utility as well
as beauty.</p>

<p>The medicinal plants of Java have been described in an
account published in the Batavian Transactions: among these
are many which are employed in the daily practice of the
natives, of which a large proportion have not been subjects of
investigation or experiment by Europeans, and others which
had not previously been botanically described or classed.
In a country hitherto imperfectly explored, and abounding in
profuse vegetation, it was natural to calculate on the discovery
of many useful medicinal plants; and among upwards of
sixty, described, for the first time, by Dr. Horsfield, he particularly
notices several, as likely to become most valuable
articles in general medicinal practice.</p>

<p>Besides abundance of coir, termed <em>sepét</em> by the natives, prepared
from the fibres which surround the cocoa-nut, and gamuti
(called <em>duk</em>), prepared from those of the <em>áren</em> tree, both
of which are well known, another species of palm, the <em>gebáng</em>,
also yields valuable ropes, the fibre of which is obtained from
the large petioles or stalks of the leaves by pounding and
beating. Intelligent natives assert, that ropes prepared from
these are particularly valuable, exceeding in strength all other
kinds of equal size. The fibres and ropes are called <em>bas</em>.
The cotton shrub (gossypium herbaceum) is universal; and
hemp, though its uses are unknown to the Javans, is found in
the gardens of foreign settlers. Besides these, the island
affords various kinds of vegetables, the fibrous bark of which
is made into thread, rope, cloth, &amp;c.; but they are never cultivated,
and when required for use are collected in their wild
state. The general denomination, in the Javan language, of
the internal bark of all vegetables which can be manufactured
into cords, thread, &amp;c. is <em>lúlub</em>. This being freed, by beating
or maceration, from the adhering particles of the exterior bark,
yields the fibrous substance, which is twisted by the most
simple process, commonly by the hands alone. The trees
which afford the <em>lúlub</em> are the <em>wáru</em>, which is very abundant,
and is manufactured into ropes for all common domestic pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Vol I Pg 43]</a></span>poses;
the <em>melínju</em>, the bark of which is called <em>bágu</em>; and
the <em>béndo</em>, which affords ropes of superior strength and
durability.</p>

<p>Of the bambusa, the <em>pring-ápus</em>, the stem of which may be
considered arborescent, furnishes the cheapest ropes. These
are made with great expedition, being split into thin strips,
which are twisted on the spot into cords fit for all common
purposes, although they are serviceable only for a few days.
They are uniformly used, in travelling, for securing baggage,
&amp;c. Among shrubs principally employed for these purposes
are the <em>werúng</em>, <em>urís-urísan</em>, <em>dalúmpang</em>, <em>che-plákan</em> and
<em>glúgo</em>; among plants, the <em>widúri</em> and <em>rámi</em>; the fibres of the
latter afford very strong and durable cords, which are chiefly
employed for nets or lines, and used in fishing: they greatly
resemble the sunn of western India, and would probably
be found to answer the same purpose, as well in furnishing
the bags called in India gunny-bags, for the transportation of
goods, as for the manufacture of paper in Europe. This
remark applies also to the <em>lúlub</em> of several of the other shrubs
mentioned. Several species of <em>písang</em> or plantain yield the
materials for ropes and cords of various fineness, according
to the methods employed in preparing them. In the
Manilla Islands, cables are made from these fibres; and in
the first volume of the Batavian Transactions a mode is
described of preparing from them a substance resembling
cotton. The leaves of the '<em>nanas</em>, or pine-apple, contain also
abundance of useful fibres, which are easily separated in a
bundle, after scraping off the coriaceous substance. It is very
fine, and the separate fibres are employed by the natives
in sewing without any preparation; but it may also be spun,
and is made into a kind of stuff resembling silk, gauze, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mats are made from several species of pandanus, from
a kind of grass called <em>méndong</em>, and from the leaves of various
palms, particularly the <em>gebáng</em>. The latter affords the most
common kinds, coarser and less durable than the others, as
well as bags (straw sacks) resembling very coarse mats.</p>

<p>The paper in common use with the Javans is manufactured
from the <em>glúgo</em>, (morus papyrifera.)</p>

<p>A variety of vegetable substances are used in dyeing: the
principal of which, however, are the <em>tom</em>, or indigo, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Vol I Pg 44]</a></span>
extensively cultivated throughout the island; and the <em>wong-kúdu</em>,
which affords a lasting scarlet. A black dye is obtained
from the bark of several exotic trees, united with the rind
of the <em>mangústin</em> fruit. A yellow dye is also obtained from
an exotic wood, heightened by the addition of the bark of
the <em>nángka</em> tree, and a variety of the mango.</p>

<p>Extensive forests of the <em>játi</em>, or teak of India<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>, are found in
almost all the eastern provinces; but the most valuable and
important are in the central districts, situated inland, between
<em>Semárang</em> and <em>Sidáyu</em>, and particularly in the districts of
<em>Blóra</em>, <em>Jípang</em>, and <em>Padáng'an</em>.</p>

<p>Of the teak tree there is but one species known, the tectona
grandis of Linnæus, the tekka of Van Rheede, and the jatus of
Rhumphius. Its natural history has been already fully detailed,
and all the kinds generally enumerated are merely varieties.
These are usually distinguished among the natives of
Java by names derived from the quality and colour of the
wood. The principal are the <em>játi kápur</em>, the chalky teak, and
a kind varying in colour, and on account of its excellence
termed <em>játi súng'gu</em>, or the true teak. The former is the most
common: its wood is of a whitish hue, and it sometimes contains
calcareous concretions in nodules or streaks. This sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Vol I Pg 45]</a></span>
is chiefly employed for common domestic purposes, and
though inferior in quality to many others, from its abundance
and comparative cheapness, is perhaps the most generally useful.
The <em>játi súng'gu</em> is harder, closer, and more ponderous,
and particularly selected for ship-building. The colour of
the wood is of different shades, from light to intense brown,
with a cast of violet verging sometimes to red or black. If the
stem is covered with spines, or rather pointed scales, it is
called <em>játi dúri</em>, but in its texture and quality it agrees with
the <em>játi súnge'gu</em>. Besides these the natives distinguish, as
<em>játi gémbol</em>, those excrescences or protuberances which are
produced from a variety of the <em>játi</em>, furnishing materials for
handsome cabinet-work.</p>

<p>The teak tree on Java grows at a moderate elevation above
the level of the ocean. It is generally conceived, that the timber
afforded by forests growing on a soil of which the basis is
limestone, and the surface uneven, gravelly, or rocky, is the
hardest, the freest from chalky concretions, and in all respects
the best; but in laying out a teak plantation, a soil consisting in
a great proportion of black vegetable mould, is always selected
for the purpose of obtaining a rapid growth. The teak tree is
slender and erect. It shoots up with considerable vigour and
rapidity, but its expansion is slow. Like all other trees affording
useful timber of a close grain, it is many years in arriving
at maturity. Under favourable circumstances, a growth of
from twenty to twenty-five years affords a tree having about
twelve inches diameter at the base. It requires at least a century
to attain its perfection, but for common purposes, it is
usually felled when between thirty and fifty years old<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the extent to which cultivation has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Vol I Pg 46]</a></span>
carried in many districts of the island, large portions of its
surface are still covered with primeval forests, affording excellent
timber of various descriptions. Besides the teak, there
are several kinds of wood or timber employed for various domestic
purposes, as the <em>súren</em> (the tuna of Bengal), of which the
wood is very light, stronger and more durable than all other
kinds of similar weight produced on the island: as the grain
is not fine, it is not employed in making furniture, but it is useful
for chests, trunks, carriages, &amp;c.; its colour is red, and its
odour somewhat resembling that of the cedar. Its weight is
probably inferior to that of the larch.​&mdash;The <em>wúngú</em> or <em>ketángi</em>
is often used instead of teak: the grain is somewhat finer:
when in full blossom it is perhaps the most beautiful tree existing.​&mdash;The
<em>wádang</em> or <em>báyur</em>, a light and tolerably durable
wood, is employed for masts and spars of small vessels; but
the surface must be well covered with resinous substances to
prevent its splitting.​&mdash;The <em>gintúngan</em> is employed in the same
manner, but grows to a larger size; the colour of the wood and
bark is red.​&mdash;The <em>lampéan</em> or <em>lában</em> is light but durable, and
affords materials for the handles of the spears or pikes borne by
the natives.​&mdash;The <em>nángka</em> abounds in several districts where
teak is not found, and is almost exclusively used in the construction
of houses, and other domestic purposes: the wood is
more close and ponderous than the <em>súren</em>, which it otherwise
resembles; it takes a tolerable polish, and is sometimes employed
for furniture. The colour is yellow; but it is made to
receive a brownish hue, by the application of the young teak-leaves
in polishing: its bark is used as a yellow dye.​&mdash;The
<em>lúren</em> resembles the <em>nángka</em>, but is generally of rare occurrence,
though in some tracts it furnishes the only timber: its use in
the neighbouring islands, particularly on Sumatra, is well
known.​&mdash;The <em>kusámbi</em> is uncommonly heavy, hard, and close:
it supplies anchors for small vessels, blocks, pestles, and numerous
similar utensils.​&mdash;The <em>sáwur</em> is a very beautiful and useful
wood; the colour resembles that of mahogany, but the grain
is closer, and it is more ponderous: its chief use is for handles
of tools for carpenters and other artificers, for machinery, especially
for the teeth of the wheels of mills, and other purposes
where a hard and durable wood is required. On account
of its scarcity, it is uniformly cut down on Java before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Vol I Pg 47]</a></span>
it arrives at the necessary size for cabinet-work. Forests of it
grow on the hills of <em>Báli</em>, opposite the Javan shore, whence it
is brought over by boat-loads for sale.</p>

<p>The <em>pílang</em> is a very hard wood, and employed in the
eastern districts, instead of lignum-vitæ, for the construction
of ships'-blocks, &amp;c.​&mdash;The <em>pung</em> is equally hard, and uniformly
employed by the natives for pegs in constructing their <em>prahus</em>.​&mdash;The
<em>wáli kúkun</em> is equal to the <em>kusámbi</em> in weight, and
exceeds it in hardness: it is employed for anchors, naves of
wheels, machinery, &amp;c.​&mdash;The <em>tang'gulun</em> is a hard wood of a
close grain, and employed by turners for various small works.​&mdash;The
<em>kelúmpit</em> is a very large tree: sections are employed by
the natives for cart wheels.​&mdash;The <em>járan</em> is a white wood taking
the tool easily: the natives prefer it to all others for the construction
of their saddles, which consist principally of wood.​&mdash;The
<em>demólo</em> affords a light wood, which is made into planks,
and employed where durability is not much required.​&mdash;The
wood of the <em>kedáwung</em> is whitish and moderately hard.​&mdash;The
<em>lában</em> is a yellowish and hard wood: it is employed for the
handles of axes and various utensils.​&mdash;The <em>jánglot</em> is considered
by the natives as the toughest wood produced in the
island, and is always employed for bows when procurable:
the tree is of a moderate size.​&mdash;The <em>béndo</em> is a light wood,
useful for canoes.​&mdash;The <em>séntul</em> is a light close-grained wood,
and easily worked: it resembles the <em>súren</em>.</p>

<p>For household furniture, cabinet-ware, &amp;c. are employed​&mdash;the
<em>sóno kling</em> of the <em>Maláyus</em>, the colour of which is a deep
brown, inclining to black:​&mdash;the <em>sóno kómbang</em>, which has
some resemblance to the <em>lingua</em> wood of the Moluccas:​&mdash;the
<em>war'm-lot</em>, dark brown; and <em>próno-sodo</em>, resembling the walnut,
both scarce:​&mdash;the <em>wer'n</em>, of a brown colour, of a close substance
and light, abundant in some districts:​&mdash;the <em>mentáus</em>
and <em>júmberit</em>, the wood of which is white and fine-grained,
uniformly used for inlaying:​&mdash;the <em>randu kúning</em>, yellowish
and close-grained:​&mdash;and the <em>íng'as</em>, of a brownish red colour,
and very brittle.</p>

<p>For the hilts and sheaths of krîses, the natives make use of
the <em>timóko</em>, of which the black and white variegated fragments
are called <em>pélet</em>. These are of various kinds.​&mdash;The <em>arúman</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Vol I Pg 48]</a></span>
variegated white and black, is also employed for canes, handles,
and spears, &amp;c. and is very heavy.​&mdash;The <em>tiké</em>, yellowish,
closed and marble,​&mdash;the <em>mángu</em>,​&mdash;the <em>áti áti</em>,​&mdash;the <em>kráminan</em>,​&mdash;the
<em>púrwo-kúning</em> and several others, are employed for the
same purposes.​&mdash;The <em>kamúning</em> is of a brownish colour and
very fine grain:​&mdash;the <em>tayúman</em> resembles the last and is very
much esteemed:​&mdash;the <em>wúni stelágo</em> affords a reddish wood.</p>

<p>Among the most extensively useful productions ought not
to be forgotten the <em>bámbu</em>, or <em>príng</em>, which abounds on Java,
and seems, from the greater luxuriance and variety by which
it is here distinguished, to find the soil and climate more congenial
to its growth than those of any other country. It blossoms
in different parts of the island. The rattans (<em>rótan</em>) of
Java are on the whole inferior to those of Sumatra and Borneo:
the improved state of cultivation is unfavourable to their
growth and propagation.</p>

<p>Many woods afford excellent fuel. The charcoal prepared
from the <em>kusámbi</em> is equal perhaps to that of any other wood
with which we are acquainted, and is universally preferred in
cooking, and in the other branches of domestic economy.
Charcoal, for gunpowder, is uniformly prepared from the celtis
orientalis, called <em>áng'grung</em>.</p>

<p>Among the useful trees must be noticed: the soap-tree, of
which the fruit is used to a very great extent in washing linen:​&mdash;the
<em>kasémak</em>, from the bark of which is made a varnish for
umbrellas:​&mdash;the <em>sámpang</em>, from the resin of which the natives
prepare a shining varnish for the wooden sheaths of krîses:​&mdash;the
cotton-tree, from which a silky wool is obtained for stuffing
pillows and beds:​&mdash;the wax-tree, which, though scarce on Java,
grows abundantly on some parts of Madúra: (the kernel, by
expression, produces an oil, which some time after becomes hard
and bears a resemblance to wax; it may be burnt in lamps or
converted into candles, and affords an agreeable odour): the <em>bendúd</em>,
a shrub producing the substance of which the elastic gum,
commonly called Indian-rubber, is prepared. The art of preparing
it in this form is however unknown in Java. Torches
are made of it, for the use of those who search for birds' nests
in the rocks, and it serves for winding round the stick employed
to strike musical instruments, as the <em>gong</em>, &amp;c. to soften<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Vol I Pg 49]</a></span>
the sound. The <em>mínyak káwon</em> or <em>niátu</em> is a very useful tree,
which grows solitary in all, and abundantly in some parts of
the island, and produces a kind of tallow.</p>

<p><em>Dámar</em>, or resin, is distinguished by the inhabitants of these
countries into two kinds: <em>dámar-bátu</em> or <em>séla</em>, and <em>dámar-puti</em>,
comprising numerous varieties obtained from different trees.
None of these are, however, produced on Java. Besides the
<em>rásamála</em>, which is very limited as to its place of growth,
the <em>Canáram</em>, and a peculiar resin employed by the natives
for varnishing the wooden sheaths of their krîses, called
<em>sámpang</em>, few odoriferous resins are found. The camphor-tree,
which abounds on Sumatra and Borneo, is unknown on
Java. The wood oil, distinguished among the Malays by the
name of <em>krúwing</em> (which in Java is applied to all resinous or
oily substances employed in the construction of vessels), is not
a native of Java, but it grows abundantly on Banka and
Sumatra.</p>

<p>None of what are called the finer kinds of spices, namely,
the nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon, are indigenous to Java; but
the few trees which have been planted in the gardens of
Europeans have thriven well: and, from the nature of the soil
and climate, there seems little doubt that the nutmeg and clove,
in particular, might be extensively cultivated throughout the
island, did it suit the policy of the European government to
admit of their general introduction.</p>

<p>The vine was once extensively cultivated in some of the
eastern provinces of the island, in which the soil and climate
appear well calculated for its growth; but an apprehension, on
the part of the Dutch East-India Company, that its cultivation
on Java might interfere with the wine trade of the Cape of
Good Hope, induced them to discourage it, and the preparation
of wine from the grape was strictly prohibited. Lieutenant-Colonel
Mackenzie, when noticing the vast quantities of ashes
thrown up from the different volcanos, makes the following
observation on the eastern part of Java. "The soil of the
country is evidently enriched by the ashes and earth
emitted by these eruptions, and there is reason to conclude,
what persons well acquainted with the south of Europe
assert, that the vines of Italy and the Cape would thrive in
perfection, in a soil and climate so well adapted to them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Vol I Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the vegetable productions of Java, none has excited
more interest than the celebrated <em>úpas</em>, or poison-tree. Mr.
Marsden, in his history of Sumatra<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, has referred to various
concurring authorities, in refutation of the very extraordinary
tales told of this tree; and, in this general account of the productions
of Java, it may perhaps be sufficient to refer the reader
to the particulars contained in the subjoined note<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Vol I Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the useful or domestic quadrupeds it may be observed,
that neither the elephant nor the camel is a native of Java:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Vol I Pg 52]</a></span>the former is rarely imported, the latter unknown. Neither
the ass nor mule is found; but the island has a fine breed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Vol I Pg 53]</a></span>small horses (<em>járan</em>), strong, fleet, and well made. A still
finer breed is imported from <em>Bíma</em>, on the neighbouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Vol I Pg 54]</a></span>island of <em>Sumbáwa</em>, which by competent judges has been said
to resemble the Arab in every respect except size. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Vol I Pg 55]</a></span>seldom exceed thirteen hands, and in general are below this
standard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Vol I Pg 56]</a></span>
The bull and cow (<em>sápi</em> or <em>lémbu</em>) are general, but much
more so in the central and eastern districts than in the western.
The breed has been greatly improved by the species
introduced from continental India. But the animal of most
essential and general use in the agriculture of the country is
the buffalo (<em>kábu</em>, <em>maísa</em>, or <em>múnding</em>), a particular account
of which will appear in the chapter on Agriculture. Goats
(<em>wedús</em>) are numerous and of a small size: sheep (called here
European goats) are scarce and small. As in other sultry
climates, the latter have a coarse woollen coat, which is
employed for stuffing saddles, pillows, &amp;c. but it is in so little
request that the inhabitants are rarely at the trouble of shearing
for it. The hog (<em>chéleng</em>) is reared principally among the
Chinese.</p>

<p>Of beasts of prey may be enumerated several species of the
tiger, as the <em>máchan lóreng</em> (felis tigris), <em>máchan gogor</em> (a
variety), <em>máchan tútul</em> (probably the small leopard of Pennant),
<em>máchan kombang</em> and <em>kúwuk</em>, the smallest kind, called tiger-cats.
The jackal, and several varieties of the wild-dog; as
the <em>ásu wáwar</em>, <em>ásu ájag</em>, or <em>ásu kíki</em>; and among other wild
quadrupeds, the rhinoceros, and <em>bánteng</em>, or wild Javan ox,
the wild-hog and the stag: the last, as well as the rib-faced
and axis deer, is tamed and fattened for food. The aggregate
number of mammalia on Java have been estimated at about
fifty. The habits and manners of the larger animals, the
tiger, leopard, black tiger, rhinoceros and stag, and two species
of deer, the varieties of the wild-hog, &amp;c. are sufficiently known;
but the <em>bánteng</em>, or Javan ox, the Javan buffalo, the varieties
of the wild-dog, those of the weasel and squirrel, and most of
the other smaller quadrupeds, still present curious subjects for
the study of the naturalist. Next to the rhinoceros, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Vol I Pg 57]</a></span>sometimes (though rarely at present) injures plantations, the
wild-hogs are the most destructive animals. They are often
poisoned (or intoxicated, according to the quantity they consume)
by the <em>kálák kámbing</em>, or by the remains from the
preparation of <em>brom</em>. The practice of suspending rags impregnated
with urine, at small distances around the plantations,
is universal over the whole island. These animals are
said to have so violent an aversion to this odour, that even
this "feeble barrier" is useful in preserving the plantations.</p>

<p>Musk, called <em>dedes</em>, is procured from the <em>rasé</em>.</p>

<p>Although the same qualities are ascribed to them here as in
other countries, bezoars are comparatively scarce in Java;
and those occasionally found in the maritime capitals are
uniformly brought from other countries. The hog-deer and
Nicobar pigeon are not natives; and although wild-hogs, in
which bezoars are said to be found, are very abundant, they
are never examined or approached by the natives. Every
extraordinary concretion, calculus, ossification, &amp;c. found in
any part of an animal, is called <em>mustíka</em>, which corresponds to
the bezoar of the Arabs, Persians, &amp;c. A concretion of feathers
found in the stomach of a fowl is called <em>mustíka áyam</em>, and is
carefully preserved. A stony concretion, discovered accidentally
by the rattling of a human skull exposed for many
years to the action of the sun, has been denominated <em>mustíka
órang</em>, and the most salutary virtues ascribed to it. Analogous
to the bezoars, must be considered the horns of the
rhinoceros, whose virtues are highly prized.</p>

<p>Among the domestic fowls, or poultry, are the turkey, which
is comparatively scarce, and chiefly raised for the tables of
Europeans; the goose, which is very common near all the
establishments of Europeans; the <em>bébek</em>, or duck, abundant
in every part of the island; the common fowl and pigeons.
Among the birds of prey, the eagle is not found; but there
are several varieties of the falcon, of which the <em>jóko wuru</em>
is the largest; also the carrion crow and the owl. Of the
parrot kind, two only, the <em>bétet</em> and <em>selíndit</em>, are found on Java.
The peacock (<em>merák</em>), is very common in large forests. The
number of distinct species of birds has been estimated not
greatly to exceed two hundred, of which upwards of one hundred
and seventy have been described, and are already con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Vol I Pg 58]</a></span>tained
in the collections made on account of the English East
India Company.</p>

<p>The dorsal feathers of the white heron, and the vent feathers
of the <em>sándang láwé</em>, are employed, as substitutes for ostrich
feathers, by the natives, for plumes, &amp;c. It is very rarely that
the feathers of geese, &amp;c. are employed for beds or pillows, the
silky cotton of the <em>kápok</em> being preferred on account of its
coolness. For ornamenting the arrows of the natives, the
feathers of some of the falcon tribe are chiefly employed.</p>

<p>Among the interesting subjects which still remain open for
search, are the habits and constitution of the hirundo esculenta,
the small swallow which forms the edible nests, annually
exported in large quantities from Java and the Eastern
Islands for the Chinese market. These birds not only abound
among the cliffs and caverns of the south coast of the island,
but inhabit the fissures and caverns of several of the mountains
and hills in the interior of the country. From every observation
which has been made on Java, it has been inferred, that
the mucilaginous substance, of which the nests are formed, is
not, as has been generally supposed, obtained from the ocean.
The birds, it is true, generally inhabit the caverns in the vicinity
of the sea, as agreeing best with their habits, and affording
them the most convenient retreats for attaching their nests
to; but several caverns are found inland, at a distance of forty
or fifty miles from the sea, containing nests similar to those on
the shore. From many of their retreats along the southern
coast, they have been observed to take their flight in an inland
direction, towards the pools, lakes, and extensive marshes covered
with stagnant water, as affording them abundance of
their food, which consists of flies, mosquitoes, gnats, and small
insects of every description. The sea that washes the foot of
the cliffs, where they most abound, is almost always in a state
of the most violent agitation, and affords none of those substances
which have been supposed to constitute the food of the
esculent swallow. Another species of swallow on this island
forms a nest, in which grass or moss, &amp;c. are merely agglutinated
by a substance, exactly similar to that of which exclusively
the edible nests consist. This substance, from whatever
part of these regions the nests be derived, is essentially
uniform, differing only in the colour, according to the relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Vol I Pg 59]</a></span>
age of the nests. It exhibits none of those diversities which
might be expected, if it were collected casually (like the mud
employed by the martin, and the materials commonly employed
in nest-making), and applied to the rocks. If it consisted of
the substances usually supposed, it would be putrescent and
diversified.</p>

<p>Dr. Horsfield thinks that it is an animal elaboration, perhaps
a kind of secretion; but to determine its nature accurately,
it should be carefully analyzed, the anatomy of the bird should
be investigated, and its character and habits watched.</p>

<p>The kayman of the Dutch, the <em>boáya</em> of the Malays, and the
<em>bóyo</em> or <em>bájul</em> of the Javans, which abounds along the shores
and in the principal rivers of the island, resembles more the
crocodile of Egypt than that of the Ganges, or the American
alligator. The character of the lacerta crocodiles, as given in
the Systema Naturæ, applies to the Javan crocodile, with this
difference, that in the latter the two crests of the tail coalesce
towards the extremity, in which respect it agrees with that of
the Ganges; but its head and jaws are broad, and rounded.
In its manners, habits, and destructive qualities, it resembles
the largest animals of this genus. Next to the crocodile in size
is the <em>béwak</em> of the Malays, or <em>menyáwak</em> or <em>selíra</em> of the
Javans. It sometimes attains the length of six or seven feet,
and lives near the banks of rivers and marshes. Its character
agrees with those of the lacerta monitor. It is erroneously denominated
the guana by Europeans. The eggs of this animal,
as well as of the crocodile, are eaten by the natives, and the
fat is collected for medical purposes. A small lizard, the
<em>búnglon</em> of the Javans, is erroneously called the chameleon, in
consequence of the property of changing its colour. It has the
specific characters of the guana, but is much smaller, seldom
exceeding eighteen or twenty inches in length. There are
various other lizards.</p>

<p>Two varieties of the turtle, <em>pényu</em> and <em>pényu kombang</em>, are
found in the seas surrounding Java. Both yield the substance
called tortoise-shell, but they are seldom taken of sufficient
size to render it valuable: the flesh is excellent. Another
kind, of which the species is unknown, renders a thicker shell.
<em>Kúro</em> is the name of the common land-tortoise, which is found
very abundantly in particular districts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Vol I Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the rana esculenta, green frog (<em>kódok íjù</em> of the
Javans) which is frequently eaten, and the <em>kódok benju</em>, there
is the common toad, <em>kódok</em>, and the <em>bánkong</em> and <em>kíntel</em>. The
frog-fish (rana paradosa), or a variety of it, is also found on the
island, and has been exhibited in the same supposed metamorphosis
as in other countries. No noxious quality of any
of these animals is here known.</p>

<p>It is uncertain whether the boa constrictor be found on Java.
The serpent usually called the <em>úlar sáwa</em> is a species of coluber,
and has been described in one of the volumes of the Batavian
Transactions; but several other species are found which arrive
at a very large size. One of them, the <em>úlar lánang</em>, is very
much dreaded by the natives, and said to be poisonous. Of the
<em>úlar sáwa</em> there are several varieties, one of which, <em>úlar sáwa
máchan</em>, is most beautifully variegated. Upwards of twenty
serpents are enumerated as poisonous. The <em>úlar lámpe</em> is
found at or near the discharge of large rivers into the ocean,
and is more abundant in some districts than in others. This
is greatly dreaded by the natives; its bite however is rarely
mortal, and the effects are comparatively slow, death seldom
occurring within twenty-four hours from the time of its infliction.
No remedies which deserve notice are known by the
natives: charms and superstitious applications are generally
resorted to. The most remarkable serpent is the <em>úlar kádut</em>,
or <em>kárang</em>. The úlar lánang, and some of the varieties <em>úlar
sáwa</em> are slender, and possess considerable agility. According
to the account of the natives, they frequently ascend trees, and
suspending themselves by the extremity of their tail, seize
upon small animals passing below; but the true <em>úlar sáwa</em> of
the Eastern Javans is slow, thick, and unwieldy. Nothing
which could illustrate its supposed power of fascination has
been noticed.</p>

<p>Of the fish most commonly used for food by the natives,
many of which are excellent and abundant, thirty-four species
of river fish, seven found chiefly in pools or stagnant waters,
and sixteen sea fish, are already enumerated by Dr. Horsfield.
The classes of amphibia and pisces, doubtless, afford many
new subjects for investigation. Valentyn enumerates five hundred
and twenty-eight uncommon kinds of fish found in the
waters of the Eastern Islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Vol I Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Honey and wax are produced by three species of bees,
inhabiting the largest forests, but they are both collected in
very inconsiderable quantities. Bees are occasionally domesticated
by the Arabs and Indians near the large settlements,
but never by the natives. Silk-worms were once introduced
by the Dutch near Batavia, but attention to them did not
extend among the natives. The chrysalis of the large atlas
affords a coarse silk, which is however not collected for use.
To the fruit, several insects, and to the corn while in the ear,
a peculiar species, generally known by the name of <em>wálang-sángít</em>,
are most destructive. The latter has in some years
destroyed the growth of whole districts, and occasioned partial
scarcity. The natives attempt, in some instances, to extirpate
it by burning chaff and brimstone in the fields. There are
scorpions and centipedes, but their bite is considered of little
consequence: the natives generally apply a cataplasm of
onions to the wound. The class of insects affords many new
objects; specimens of most of the genus papilio, and many of
other genera have already been collected.</p>

<p>Java does not afford the same opportunities for beautiful
collections of shells as the Moluccas, Papua, and other Islands.
Along the northern coast, few shells are found of beauty or
variety, and the corallines have mostly lost their integrity by attrition;
but the extensive bays in the southern shore contain
many of these objects in a state of beauty and perfection.</p>

bears a great resemblance to Ιάων. This Javan was the fourth son of
Japheth, and is said to have come into Greece after the confusion of Babel,
and seated himself in Attica; and this report receives no small confirmation
from the divine writings, where the name of Javan is in several places put

<em>Jawa</em>, and to have been used with the same latitude, according to the following
notices by Major Wilford. "There was a constant intercourse,
both by sea and land, between the kingdom of <em>Magad'hi</em> and China, on
the authority of Chinese history; and they traded to an island and kingdom,
called Founan, to the eastward of Siam, during the third and fourth
centuries. This was probably a Malay kingdom; but we cannot ascertain
its situation. It seems that the Malay emperors and kings, as those of
<em>Zapagi</em> and <em>Founan</em>, did what they could to introduce trade and learning
into their dominions, but their exertions proved ineffectual; at least they
were not attended with much success; and their subjects soon relapsed into
their former mode of life." ... "There are two countries called Maharaja,
which are often confounded together; the first, at the bottom of the
Green Sea, including Bengal and all the countries on the banks of the
Ganges; the second comprehended the peninsula of Malacca, and some of
the adjacent islands in the seas of China. In these countries the emperor,
or king, always assumed the title of Maharaja, even until this day. Their
country, in general, was called <em>Zapagé</em> or <em>Zabaja</em>, which is a corruption
from <em>Java</em> or <em>Jaba</em>, as it was called in the west, and was also the name of
Sumatra, according to Ptolemy, who calls it <em>Jaba-diu</em>, and to Marco Polo.
In the peninsula of Malacca was the famous emporium of <em>Zaba</em>: Zubaja,
in Sanscrit, would signify then <em>Zaba</em>. The empire of <em>Zabajé</em> was thus
called, probably, from its metropolis, <em>Zaba</em>, as well as the principal islands
near it. <em>Zaba</em> was a principal emporium even as early as the time of
Ptolemy. It remained so till the time of the two Mussulman travellers of
Renaudot, and probably much longer. It is now called <em>Batu Sabor</em>, upon
the river Jehor, which is as large as the Euphrates, according to these
travellers; who add, that the town of Calabar, on the coast of Coromandel,
and ten days to the south of Madras, belonged to the Maharaja of Zabaje.
The wars of this Maharaja with the king of <em>Alkoner</em> or countries near Cape
Comorin, are mentioned by the two Mussulman travellers in the ninth century,
and it seems that, at that time, the Malayan empire was in its
greatest splendor."​&mdash;<em>Asiatic Researches</em>, vol. ix.</p></div>

account of two or three of the volcanos which have been examined by that

therefore, extracted from a paper published by Dr. Horsfield in the
Batavian Transactions.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Tankuban-Prahu.</span>​&mdash;This mountain (which has derived its name
from its appearance at a distance, resembling a <em>prahu</em>, or boat, turned
upside down) forms a vast truncated cone. Its base extends to a very
great distance, and it belongs to the largest mountains of the island,
forming one of its most interesting volcanos. Although it has had no
violent eruption for many ages, as is evident from the progress of vegetation,
and from the depth of black mould which covers its sides, its
interior has continued in a state of uninterrupted activity.
</p>
<p>
"The crater is one of the largest, perhaps the largest, of the island. It
has, in general, the shape of a funnel; but its sides are very irregular.
The brim, or margin, which bounds it at the top, has also different
degrees of elevation, rising and descending along the whole course of
its circumference. The perpendicular depth at the side, where I descended
(in the south), is at least two hundred and fifty feet: in the
west the margin rises considerably higher. The regular circumference
of the crater I estimate one English mile and nearly an half. The south
side of the interior crater, near the top, is very steep. I found it impossible
to descend, without the assistance of ropes tied to the shrubs
at the margin. It consists here of small fragments of lava. About one-third
of its depth it becomes more oblique or inclining, and the lower
part consists of large piles of rocks, through which the descending
streams of water have excavated a winding channel. The east side descends
gradually about one-half of the depth, where it is terminated
abruptly by a perpendicular pile of large rocks, which continues to the
bottom. The north side is more gradually shelving than the others,
and is partly covered with vegetation. The west side is one perpendicular
pile of rocks. The nucleus of the mountain consists of large
masses of basaltes, in which the volcanic opening is situated; and the
sides exhibit piles and strata of this stone in every possible variety of
configuration. In some places the rocks have the appearance of a
regular wall, which is suddenly diversified by large fragments suspended
apparently by a small base, and threatening to fall down every instant.
Sometimes they rise in an oblique manner, and appear to have been
disposed by art. But I shall not attempt a minute description of the
disposition of the rocks and the strata which form the internal walls of
the crater, which, without an accurate drawing, would be tedious and
scarcely intelligible. The surface of the rocks which line the interior of
the crater is completely calcined, generally of a white colour, sometimes
inclining to grey or yellow. In many places small fragments of
lava adhere to and cover the rocks of basalt: these are of different sizes,
and of great variety of form and colour; but the most are calcined or
burnt, or the surface like the rocks themselves. The different sides of
the internal crater are excavated in many places, by furrows made by
the descending water, which penetrate to a considerable depth, and expose
more completely the interior basaltic composition. The bottom
of the crater has a diameter of three hundred yards, but is not completely
regular; its form depends on the gradual meeting of the sides
below. Its surface is much diversified: it is strewed, like the sides,
with immense blocks of basalt, the interstices between which are excavated,
in a similar manner, by the streams of the descending water.
</p>
<p>
"Near the centre, somewhat inclining to the west side, it contains an
irregular oval lake, or collection of water, whose greatest diameter is
nearly one hundred yards: it dilates into several branches. The water
is white, and exhibits truly the appearance of a lake of milk, boiling
with a perpetual discharge of large bubbles, which rise with greatest
force from the eastern side. The heat is 112° of Fahrenheit's scale:
the apparent boiling arises from a constant development of fixed air.
The water has a sulphureous odour; its taste is astringent, somewhat
saline. Shaken in a bottle it explodes its fixed air with great violence.
The sides of the lake, to some distance, are lined by a white aluminous
earth, most impalpably fine, and very loose, on which account it is
very difficult to approach the water. In attempting to examine its
temperature, and to collect for analysis, I sunk into the earth to a
considerable distance, and found it necessary to dispose large fragments
of basaltes before I was able to pass over it. This earth consists of the
clay (alumine) of the lavas dissolved by the sulphureous steams on the
bottom of the crater; it is of the purest kind, and divided to a degree
minute almost beyond conception. Large quantities have been several
times thrown out of the ancient craters of the island. One eruption of
this substance occurred in the year 1761 from the mountain Gedé: it
was considered as an eruption of ashes.
</p>
<p>
"I was witness to a similar eruption, which occurred from the mountain
of <em>Klut</em>, in the month of June last year. The earth very much
resembled ashes, and was so impalpably fine and light, that the common
breeze of the monsoon carried it from this mountain, situated in the
longitude of Surabáya, to Batavia and farther westward. It possessed
the properties of the purest clay, and being mixed with water became
viscid and ductile. It can easily be formed into vessels, and if procurable
in large quantities, might usefully be employed in the arts. All its
properties indicated sufficiently that it was the alumine of the lavas,
divided in an extreme degree by the causes above-mentioned. The Javanese
are not wholly unacquainted with the properties of this earth.
It is a custom amongst silversmiths to collect the ashes thrown out by
similar eruptions, for the purpose of making <em>moulds</em> for the finest works.
</p>
<p>
"Towards the eastern extremity of the lake are the remaining outlets
of the subterraneous fires: they consist of several apertures, from which
an uninterrupted discharge of sulphureous vapours takes place. Two
of these are larger than the rest; they are several feet distant from each
other. The apertures are of an irregular oblong form, and covered
with crystals of impure sulphur, which form from the discharged vapours,
and adhere to those incrustations of the aluminous earth which
have formed themselves in a great variety of configurations (hollows,
tubes, &amp;c.) near the apertures. The vapours rush out with incredible
force, with violent subterraneous noises, resembling the boiling of an
immense cauldron in the bowels of the mountain: their colour is white,
like the concentrated vapours of boiling water. The apertures cannot
be approached without the greatest danger, as their true extent cannot
be discovered: they are surrounded by incrustations of sulphur adhering
to delicate laminæ of the aluminous earth, which are extremely
brittle. The greatest diameter of the large opening is nearly twelve
inches.
</p>
<p>
"To give an adequate description of the interior of this crater would
furnish matter for an able pen: the force of the impression is increased,
perhaps, by the recollection of the danger which has been overcome in
descending to the bottom. Every thing here contributes to fill the mind
with the most awful satisfaction. It doubtless is one of the most grand
and terrific scenes which nature affords; and, in the present instance,
the extent of the crater, as well as the remains of the former explosions,
afforded a view and enjoyment which is not in my power to describe.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Papandayang.</span>​&mdash;The Papandáyang, situated on the western part of
the district of Cheribon, in the province of <em>Suka-pura</em>, was formerly one
of the largest volcanos of the island; but the greatest part of it was
swallowed up in the earth, after a short but very severe combustion, in
the year 1772. The account which has remained of this event asserts,
that near midnight, between the 11th and 12th of August, there was
observed about the mountain an uncommonly luminous cloud, by which
it appeared to be completely enveloped. The inhabitants, as well
about the foot as on the declivities of the mountain, alarmed by this appearance,
betook themselves to flight; but before they could all save
themselves, the mountain began to give way, and the greatest part of it
actually <em>fell</em> in and disappeared in the earth. At the same time, a tremendous
noise was heard, resembling the discharge of the heaviest
cannon. Immense quantities of volcanic substances, which were thrown
out at the same time and spread in every direction, propagated the effects
of the explosion through the space of many miles.
</p>
<p>
"It is estimated, that an extent of ground, of the mountain itself and
its immediate environs, fifteen miles long and full six broad, was by this
commotion swallowed up in the bowels of the earth. Several persons,
sent to examine the condition of the neighbourhood, made report, that
they found it impossible to approach the mountain, on account of the
heat of the substances which covered its circumference, and which were
piled on each other to the height of three feet; although this was the
24th of September, and thus full six weeks after the catastrophe. It is
also mentioned, that forty villages, partly swallowed up by the ground
and partly covered by the substances thrown out, were destroyed on this
occasion, and that 2,957 of the inhabitants perished. A proportionate
number of cattle was also destroyed, and most of the plantations of cotton,
indigo, and coffee, in the adjacent districts, were buried under the
volcanic matter. The effects of this explosion are still very apparent on
the remains of this volcano; but I defer an account of it, till I have had
an opportunity of making a more minute examination.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Guntur.</span>​&mdash;The whole of the eastern part of this mountain is completely
naked, and exposes to view, in a striking manner, the course of
the lavas of the latter eruptions: the top is a regular cone, and covered
with loose fragments of lava. I shall give a very concise abstract of the
observations on the mountain, and on the different streams of lava which
have lately flowed from its crater. I could distinctly trace, from the
base of the conical top to the roots of the mountain, five different eruptions.
The latest stream of lava which I examined (the mountain
has since had a later eruption) was thrown out in 1800. Its course
along the top cannot be distinctly observed, being completely covered
with sand and small fragments of lava, which generally rise towards the
end of an eruption. At the place where the stream first appeared distinctly,
it was about five yards broad and completely even on the surface:
having proceeded about twenty yards further it gradually widened,
and was formed into a connected stream, higher in the middle, the sides
tapering or inclining towards the top, forming a ridge with a pointed or
sharp back. As the stream arrived at the foot of the mountain, it spread
more and more, and pursued its course to the eastward, about six hundred
yards over the adjacent country. Its greatest breadth, from north
to south, is about one hundred and sixty yards, and it terminates abruptly
by a rounded margin, consisting of large blocks of lava piled upon each
other, nearly perpendicularly, to the height of fifteen to twenty feet.
</p>
<p>
"This stream of lava, like all the others of later date which I have examined
on the island, does not consist of a connected mass of fluid lava,
united like a stream of melted metal; at least on the surface where it is
exposed to view. It is made up of separate masses, which have an irregular
(generally oblong or cubical) shape, and lie upon each other as
'loose disjointed clods,' in an immense variety of disposition. In some
of these fragments I think I could observe a tendency to assume the regular
basaltic figure. During its course down the steeps of the mountain,
the stream, as has been observed, forms the long connected ridge
(which has been described above, in the account of the volcanos, as generally
covering the sides); but having arrived at the foot and spread
more at large, these lumps of lava dispose themselves, in some instances,
in plains, bounded by deep vallies: now they rise to a considerable height,
and form a steep perpendicular eminence; then again they are piled upon
each other more gradually, and appear rising by steps and divisions.
But to give an accurate description of the arrangement of these fragments
of lava would be unnecessarily prolix, and would require, to be
clearly understood, a good drawing. In different places, the sulphureous
vapours have forced their way through the interstices of the blocks of
lava. The sides of their outlets (whose form is very irregular) is covered
with a white calcareous crust; and the heat is so great, that small pieces
of paper thrown into them are immediately singed.
</p>
<p>
"This stream of lava is bounded on the north by another, of the same
nature and disposition, thrown out of the mountain (according to an
estimate made from the commencement and progress of vegetation upon
it) about thirty years ago. In its course along the sides of the mountain
it forms the same pointed ridges above described. It affords a plain
demonstration of the manner in which the surface of lava is decomposed
and rendered fit for vegetation. A third district of lava bounds the new
stream first described in the south: it is more extensive than the others,
and consists of several distinct regions, probably thrown out during one
eruption (which appears to have been more violent than the others), but
in successive periods shortly following each other. It extends farther
to the eastward than the others, and covers a great portion of the foot
of the mountain. Vegetation has already made considerable progress
upon it: in the vallies between the separate streams of lava are found
not only plants but also small shrubs. At one place, near the termination
of this stream, the lava is piled up in two irregular ridges to the
height of twenty feet; and at a small distance from its eastern extremity,
in a spot which has escaped the effects of the later eruptions, and is
covered by pleasant wood, are three different hot wells, within the circumference
of a quarter of a mile. In the south, this district of lava is
bounded by a recent stream, which appears to have been thrown out in
1800, by the same eruption which produced the first mentioned stream.
It differs from the others only in the colour of its lava, which has a
reddish hue: it is less considerable in extent than any of the others, and
cannot be traced far from the foot of the mountain. The fifth stream
of lava which I examined is still farther towards the south, and is one
of the oldest which have been discharged from the eastern part of the
crater. Near the foot of the mountain, vegetation has made greater
progress than in any of the other districts of lava.
</p>
<p>
"The colour of the recent lava of this mountain is jet-black or grey:
one of the streams only has a reddish colour. Its texture is very loose,
and its fracture very porous. The smaller fragments have much the
appearance of the scoriæ of a blacksmith's forge: on being thrown
against each other, they emit a sound like two bricks coming into
contact. The interior crater of this mountain, as it has remained after
the eruption of 1800, is less interesting than the others which I have
examined. Its shape is somewhat oval, the greatest diameter being
about one hundred yards: its depth is not very considerable. Its structure,
in general, is similar to that of <em>Tankuban-prahu</em>. It has one remaining
aperture, which discharges with great force hot sulphureous
vapours."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Mineral wells, of various qualities, are found in almost every part of
the island. As an instance of the hot wells, the following account of those
found in Cheribon is selected. "At the village of <em>Bongas</em> (situated about
ten miles to the north-east of <em>Karang-Sambong</em>) I directed my route to
the large mountain, in order to examine part of the hills along its foot,
called the hills of <em>Pana-wangan</em>, and several hot wells which are found
near their borders. On approaching these hills, after a very gentle
acclivity covered entirely by calcareous stones, I very soon came to the
spot of the hot wells. They are found on a gently inclining plain, about
one hundred yards in circumference. This plain is perfectly white;
and on approaching it, it is perceived at some distance by a sulphureous
vapour, arising from the whole neighbourhood. The water springs
from several apertures, but their temperatures are not equal; the
hottest indicates the degree of one hundred and thirty of Fahrenheit's
scale. They all contain a very large quantity of calcareous earth in
solution and suspension, which coming into contact with the air, immediately
separates, and adheres to the surrounding objects, or is precipitated
to the ground. The branches of the shrubs in the vicinity are
all enveloped by a stalactical incrustation. The water from the different
wells gently descending the white calcareous plain, is collected in a
rivulet below. A large number of calcareous rocks are found in the
vicinity of the plains; some are covered with elegant crystals of calcareous
spar, others have a coralline appearance, and some have the
fracture of alabaster. On proceeding up the hills, immense irregular
blocks of calcareous rocks are found strewed about in the valleys.
About one hundred yards above this district are several wells of naphtha,
or petroleum. It rises in small plashes of water, about twelve or
eighteen inches in diameter, upon which it drives its black specks,
emitting the peculiar odour of the petroleum. The earth in the circumference
of these plashes is strongly impregnated with this oil: it is very
tough, and from that immediately bounding apertures, the naphtha flows
out on its being pressed; some portions exactly resemble asphaltum.
A considerable space of ground is occupied by these wells. The stones
are all calcareous. A few hundred yards above this spot, the borders
of the hills become very steep. I examined them to some extent. They
are composed exclusively of calcareous stones. Several extensive stalactitic
caves are found at no great distance above the wells; they
exhibit the usual appearances of calcareous caves and vaults. The
process of incrustation is continually going on. In some places, deep
perforations extend into the heart of the hills."​&mdash;<em>Essay on the Mineralogy

<p>
Among other objects of curiosity, which can only be illustrated by particular
description, are the explosions of mud, situated between the district
of Grobogan on the west, and of Blora and Jipang on the east. By the
natives they are termed Blédeg, and are described by Dr. Horsfield as salt
wells.
</p>
<p>
"These salt wells," he observes, "are dispersed through a district of
country several miles in circumference, the base of which, like that of
other parts of the island which furnish mineral and other saline waters,
is limestone. They are of considerable number, and force themselves
upwards, through apertures in the rocks, with some violence and ebullition.
The waters are strongly impregnated with sea-salt, and yield
upon evaporation very good salt for culinary purposes. (In quantity
not less than two hundred tons in the year.)
</p>
<p>
"About the centre of this limestone district, is found an extraordinary
volcanic phenomenon. On approaching it from a distance, it is first
discovered by a large volume of smoke rising and disappearing at
intervals of a few seconds, resembling the vapours arising from a violent
surf: a dull noise is heard, like that of distant thunder. Having
advanced so near, that the vision was no longer impeded by the smoke,
a large hemispherical mass was observed, consisting of black earth,
mixed with water, about sixteen feet in diameter, rising to the height of
twenty or thirty feet in a perfectly regular manner, and as it were
pushed up, by a force beneath; which suddenly exploded with a dull
noise, and scattered about a volume of black mud in every direction.
After an interval of two or three, or sometimes four or five seconds, the
hemispherical body of mud or earth rose and exploded again. In the
same manner this volcanic ebullition goes on without interruption,
throwing up a globular body of mud, and dispersing it with violence
through the neighbouring plain. The spot where the ebullition occurs
is nearly circular and perfectly level, it is covered only with the earthy
particles impregnated with salt water, which are thrown up from below;
the circumference may be estimated at about half an English mile. In
order to conduct the salt water to the circumference, small passages, or
gutters, are made in the loose muddy earth, which lead it to the borders,
where it is collected in holes dug in the ground for the purpose of
evaporation.
</p>
<p>
"A strong, pungent, sulphureous smell, somewhat resembling that of
earth-oil, is perceived on standing near the explosion; and the mud
recently thrown up possesses a degree of heat greater than that of the
surrounding atmosphere. During the rainy season these explosions are
more violent, the mud is thrown up much higher, and the noise is
heard at a greater distance.
</p>
<p>
"This volcanic phenomenon is situated near the centre of the large
plain which interrupts the large series of volcanos; and owes its origin
to the general cause of the numerous volcanic eruptions which occur
on the island." <em>Batavian Trans.</em> vol. ix.
</p>
<p>
"These salt wells, as Dr. Horsfield terms them, and other phenomena
connected with them, appear to be precisely of the same description as the
mud volcano at Macalouba, in Sicily, and the eruptions described by
Pallas, at Tainan and Kercha (the boundary of Europe to the south-east
of Little Tartary) and no doubt owe their origin to similar causes​&mdash;the
extrication of gas, as well described by Dallas, in his Translation of the
History of Volcanos, by the Abbé Ordinaire," page 249. All the phenomenon
described in this work, as well in Sicily as at Tainan and
Kercha, are to be found in Java, where, on the hypothesis of the Abbé,
"the vitriolic acid liberating a great quantity of fixed air from the salts
with which this argillaceous and limy mass is impregnated, is observed
escaping copiously, by a general bubbling on the surface of the plain,
when the substances are sufficiently diluted by rain," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
On the hypothesis of the Abbé it may, therefore, be doubted whether
the assertion "that the Blédegs owe their origin to the general cause of the
numerous volcanos on the island, is correct." Pallas conceives that the
phenomenon at Kercha and Tainan may be explained by supposing a deep
coal mine to have been for ages on fire, that the sea broke in upon it, that
the water was turned into steam, and that the expansion occasioned
thereby, and the struggle of the different gases to get free, force the upper
surface, &amp;c. but there seems no necessity for admitting the action of fire;
the mud he describes is only <em>luke-warm</em>, this is precisely the case in Java.
</p>
<p>
It is remarkable that in Java, as in Sicily, in the vicinity of these phenomena,
"the country around is of calcareous earth; briny springs and
salt mines are found in the neighbourhood; some beds of oil of petroleum
are also observed floating on adjacent stagnant waters."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> In order to give the reader some idea of the tremendous violence with
which nature sometimes distinguishes the operations of the volcano in
these regions, and enable him to form some conjecture, from the occurrences
of recent experience, of the effects they may have produced in past
ages, a short account of the extraordinary and wide-spread phenomena
that accompanied the eruption of the Tomboro mountain, in the island of
Sumbawa, in April 1815, may not be uninteresting. Almost every one is
acquainted with the intermitting convulsions of Etna and Vesuvius, as
they appear in the descriptions of the poet and the authentic accounts of
the naturalist, but the most extraordinary of them can bear no comparison,
in point of duration and force, with that of Tomboro. This eruption
extended perceptible evidences of its existence over the whole of the Molucca
islands, over Java, a considerable portion of Celebes, Sumatra, and
Borneo, to a circumference of a thousand statute miles from its centre,
by tremulous motions, and the report of explosions; while within the
range of its more immediate activity, embracing a space of three hundred
miles around it, it produced the most astonishing effects, and excited the
most alarming apprehensions. On Java, at the distance of three hundred
miles, it seemed to be awfully present. The sky was overcast at noon-day
with clouds of ashes, the sun was enveloped in an atmosphere, whose
"palpable" density he was unable to penetrate; showers of ashes covered
the houses, the streets, and the fields to the depth of several inches; and
amid this darkness explosions were heard at intervals, like the report of
artillery or the noise of distant thunder. So fully did the resemblance of
the noises to the report of cannon impress the minds of some officers, that
from an apprehension of pirates on the coast vessels were dispatched to
afford relief. Superstition, on the other hand, on the minds of the natives,
was busily at work, and attributed the reports to an artillery of a
different description to that of pirates. All conceived that the effects experienced
might be caused by eruptions of some of the numerous volcanos
on the island; but no one could have conjectured that the showers of
ashes which darkened the air, and covered the ground of the eastern districts
of Java, could have proceeded from a mountain in Sumbawa, at the
distance of several hundred miles. Conceiving that it might be interesting
and curious to preserve an authentic and detailed account of the information
that could be gained of this wonderful phenomenon, while the event
was still recent and fully remembered, I directed a circular to the different
Residents, requiring them to transmit to the Government a statement of
the facts and circumstances connected with it, which occurred within their
own knowledge. From their replies, the narrative drawn up by Mr.
Assey, and printed in the ninth volume of the Batavian Transactions,
was collected; the following is an extract from that paper:​&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The first explosions were heard on this island (Java) in the evening
of the 5th of April: they were noticed in every quarter, and continued
at intervals until the following day. The noise was, in the first instance,
universally attributed to distant cannon: so much so, that a detachment
of troops was marched from Djocjocarta, under the apprehension that a
neighbouring post had been attacked; and along the coast boats were
in two instances dispatched in quest of supposed ships in distress. On
the following morning, however, a slight fall of ashes removed all doubt
as to the cause of the sound; and it is worthy of remark, that as the
eruption continued, the sound appeared to be so close, that in each
district it seemed near at hand, and was generally attributed to an eruption
either from the mountains Merapi, Klut, or Bromo. From the 6th
the sun became obscured; it had every where the appearance of being
enveloped in a fog. The weather was sultry and the atmosphere close,
and still the sun seemed shorn of its rays, and the general stillness and
pressure of the atmosphere seemed to forebode an earthquake. This
lasted several days. The explosions continued occasionally, but less
violently, and less frequently than at first. Volcanic ashes also began
to fall, but in small quantities, and so slightly as to be hardly perceptible
in the western district. This appearance of the atmosphere continued,
with little variation, until the 10th of April; and till then it
does not appear that the volcano attracted much observation, or was
considered of greater importance than those which have occasionally
burst forth in Java. But on the evening of the 10th, the eruptions were
heard more loud and more frequent; from Cheribon eastward the air
became darkened by the quantity of falling ashes; the sun was nearly
darkened; and in some situations, particularly at Solo and Rembang,
many said that they felt a tremulous motion of the earth. It was universally
remarked in the more eastern districts, that the explosions were
tremendous, continuing frequently during the 11th, and of such violence
as to shake the houses perceptibly. An unusual thick darkness was remarked
all the following night, and the greater part of the next day.
At Solo candles were lighted at 4 p. m. of the 12th; at Mágelan in
Kédu, objects could not be seen at three hundred yards distance. At
Grésik, and other districts more eastward, it was dark as night in the
greater part of the 12th April, and this saturated state of the atmosphere
lessened as the cloud of ashes passed along and discharged itself on its
way. Thus the ashes that were eight inches deep at Bányuwángi were
but two in depth at Súmenap, and less in Grésik, and the sun does not
seem to have been actually obscured in any district west of Semárang.
</p>
<p>
"All reports concur in stating, that so violent and extensive an eruption
has not happened within the memory of the oldest inhabitant, nor
within tradition. They speak of similar effects, in a lesser degree, when
an eruption took place from the volcano of Karang Asam in Bali, about
seven years ago, and it was at first supposed that this mountain was the
seat of the eruption. The Balinese on Java attributed the event to a
recent dispute between the two Rajahs of Bali Baliling, which terminated
in the death of the younger Rajah by order of his brother.
</p>
<p>
"The haziness and heat of the atmosphere, and occasional fall of volcanic
ashes, continued until the 14th, and in some parts of the island
until the 17th of April. They were cleared away universally by a heavy
fall of rain, after which the atmosphere became clear and more cool;
and it would seem that this seasonable relief prevented much injury to
the crops, and removed an appearance of epidemic disease which was
beginning to prevail. This was especially the case at Batavia, where,
for two or three days preceding the rain, many persons were attacked
with fever. As it was, however, no material injury was felt beyond the
districts of Banyuwángi. The cultivators every where took precaution
to shake off the ashes from the growing paddy as they fell, and the timely
rain removed an apprehension very generally entertained, that insects
would have been generated by the long continuance of the ashes at the
root of the plant. In Rembang, where the rain did not fall till the 17th,
and the ashes had been considerable, the crops were somewhat injured;
but in Banyuwángi, the part of the island on which the cloud of ashes
spent its force, the injury was more extensive. A large quantity of
paddy was totally destroyed, and all the plantations more or less injured.
One hundred and twenty-six horses and eighty-six head of cattle also
perished, chiefly for want of forage, during a month from the time of
the eruption.
</p>
<p>
"From Sumbawa to the part of Sumatra where the sound was noticed,
is about nine hundred and seventy geographical miles in a direct line.
From Sumbawa to Ternate is a distance of about seven hundred and
twenty miles. The distance also to which the cloud of ashes was carried,
so quickly as to produce utter darkness, was clearly pointed out to have
been the island of Celebes and the districts of Grésik on Java: the former
is two hundred and seventeen nautical miles distant from the seat
of the volcano; the latter, in a direct line, more than three hundred geographical
miles."
</p>
<p>
The following is an extract from the reports of Lieutenant Owen Phillips,
dated at Bima on the island of Sumbawa. "On my trip towards the
western part of the island, I passed through nearly the whole of Dompo
and a considerable part of Bima. The extreme misery to which the
inhabitants have been reduced is shocking to behold. There were still
on the road-side the remains of several corpses, and the marks of where
many others had been interred: the villages almost entirely deserted and
the houses fallen down, the surviving inhabitants having dispersed in
search of food. The Rajah of Sang'ir came to wait on me at Dompo,
on the 3d instant. The suffering of the people there appears, from his
account, to be still greater than in Dompo. The famine has been so
severe that even one of his own daughters died from hunger. I presented
him with three coyangs of rice in your name, for which he appeared
most truly thankful.
</p>
<p>
"As the Rajah was himself a spectator of the late eruption, the following
account which he gave me is perhaps more to be depended upon than
any other I can possibly obtain. About 7 p. m. on the 10th of April,
three distinct columns of flame burst forth near the top of the Tomboro
mountain (all of them apparently within the verge of the crater), and
after ascending separately to a very great height, their tops united
in the air in a troubled confused manner. In a short time, the whole
mountain next Sang'ir appeared like a body of liquid fire, extending itself
in every direction. The fire and columns of flame continued to rage
with unabated fury, until the darkness caused by the quantity of falling
matter obscured it at about 8 p. m. Stones, at this time, fell very thick
at Sang'ir; some of them as large as two fists, but generally not larger
than walnuts. Between 9 and 10 p. m. ashes began to fall, and soon
after a violent whirlwind ensued, which blew down nearly every house in
the village of Sang'ir, carrying the ataps, or roofs, and light parts away
with it. In the part of Sang'ir adjoining Tomboro its effects were much
more violent, tearing up by the roots the largest trees and carrying them
into the air, together with men, horses, cattle, and whatever else came
within its influence. (This will account for the immense number of
floating trees seen at sea). The sea rose nearly twelve feet higher than
it had ever been known to do before, and completely spoiled the only
small spots of rice land in Sang'ir, sweeping away houses and every
thing within its reach. The whirlwind lasted about an hour. No explosions
were heard till the whirlwind had ceased, at about 11 a. m.
From midnight till the evening of the 11th, they continued without intermission;
after that time their violence moderated, and they were only
heard at intervals, but the explosions did not cease entirely until the
15th of July. Of the whole villages of Tomboro, Tempo containing
about forty inhabitants is the only one remaining. In Pekáté no vestige
of a house is left: twenty-six of the people, who were at Sumbawa at
the time, are the whole of the population who have escaped. From the
most particular inquiries I have been able to make, there were certainly
not fewer than twelve thousand individuals in Tomboro and Pekáté at
the time of the eruption, of whom only five or six survive. The trees
and herbage of every description, along the whole of the north and west
sides of the peninsula, have been completely destroyed, with the exception
of a high point of land near the spot where the village of Tomboro
stood."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> It is remarkable that the teak tree, which, as far as our information
yet extends, is not to be found on the peninsula of Malacca, or on Sumatra
or the adjacent islands, should grow in abundance on Java and
several of the islands which lie east of it: as on Madúra and its dependent
islands, Báli, Sumbáwa, and others. Sumbáwa produces a considerable
quantity. The whole of the hills on the north-east part of that
island under Bíma are covered with it; but from the constant demand for
the timber, the trees are seldom allowed to grow to more than a foot in
diameter, except in the forests exclusively appropriated to the use of the
sovereign. In Dómpo, which occupies the central division of the same
island, the teak cannot be used by any but the sovereign, and the trees
are in consequence allowed to attain their full size. The timber is here
uncommonly fine, and by the natives considered superior to that of Java;
but the forests being surrounded by steep hills, and the population but
scanty, it cannot be transported to the sea-coast without great labour and
expense. On Celebes the teak tree is only known in a few spots. The
principal forest is in the district of Mario; and this does not appear to be
indigenous, as the natives assert that the seed from which the forest has
grown, was brought from Java about eighty years ago by one of the
sovereigns of Tanété.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> The Dutch, apprehensive of a failure in the usual supply of teak
timber, have long been in the habit of forming extensive plantations of
this tree; but whether from a sufficient period not having yet elapsed for
the trial, or that the plantations are generally made in soils and situations
ill calculated for the purpose, experience, as far as it has yet gone, has
shown, that the trees which are left to the operations of nature, attain to
greater perfection, even in a comparatively barren soil, unfit for any other
cultivation, than those which are with great care and trouble reared in a
fertile land. Their wood is more firm, more durable, and of a less chalky
substance than that of the latter.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Although a serious refutation of the gross imposition practised on the
people of Europe, by the romance of Foersch on the subject of the upas,
or celebrated poison-tree of Java, may at this day be in a great measure
superfluous, as the world has long ceased to be the dupe of his story, and
as regular series of experiments have been instituted, both in France and in
England, to ascertain the nature and potency of the poison; yet it may
not be altogether displeasing to the reader to see in this place an authentic
account of the poison, as drawn out by Dr. Horsfield at my request, and published
in the seventh volume of the Batavian Transactions. Almost every
one has heard of its fabulous history, which, from its extravagant nature,
its susceptibility of poetical ornament, its alliance with the cruelties of a
despotic government, and the sparkling genius of Darwin, whose purpose
it answered to adopt and personify it as a malignant spirit (in his Lives of
the Plants), has obtained almost equal currency with the wonders of the
Lerna Hydra, the Chimera, or any other of the classic fictions of antiquity.
</p>
<p>
"Although the account published by Foersch, in so far as relates to the
situation of the poison-tree, to its effects on the surrounding country,
and to the application said to have been made of the upas on criminals
in different parts of the island, as well as the description of the poisonous
substance itself, and its mode of collection, has been demonstrated
to be an extravagant forgery,​&mdash;the existence of a tree on Java, from the
sap of which a poison is prepared, equal in fatality, when thrown into the
circulation, to the strongest animal poisons hitherto known, is a fact
which is at present my object to establish and illustrate. The tree which
produces this poison is the anchar, and grows in the eastern extremity
of the island. The work of Rhumphius contains a long account of the
upas, under the denomination of arbor toxicaria. The tree does not
grow on Amboyna, and his description was made from the information
he obtained from Makasar. His figure was drawn from a branch of
what is called the male-tree, sent to him from the same place, and establishes
the identity of the poison-tree of Makasar, and the other Eastern
Islands, with the anchar of Java. The simple sap of the arbor toxicaria
(according to Rhumphius) is harmless, and requires the addition of several
substances, of the affinity of ginger, to render it active and mortal.
In so far it agrees with the anchar, which, in its simple state, is
<em>supposed</em> to be inert, and before being employed as a poison, is subjected
to a preparation which will be described after the history of the tree.
Besides the true poison-tree, the upas of the Eastern Islands, and the
anchar of the Javans, this island produces a shrub, which, as far as observations
have hitherto been made, is peculiar to the same, and, by a
different mode of preparation, furnishes a poison far exceeding the upas
in violence. Its name is chetik, and its specific description will succeed
to that of the anchar: the genus has not yet been discovered or described.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Description of the Anchar.</span>​&mdash;The anchar belongs to the twenty-first
class of Linnæus, the monoecia. The male and female flowers are produced
in catkins (amenta) on the same branch, at no great distance
from each other: the female flowers are in general above the male.
The characters of the genus are:​&mdash;<span class="smcap">Male</span> flower; calix, consisting of several
scales, which are imbricate. Corol; none. Stamens; filaments
many, very short, covered with scales at the receptacle. The receptacle,
on which the filaments are placed, has a conical form, abrupt, somewhat
rounded above.​&mdash;<span class="smcap">Female</span> flower; catkins, ovate. Calix; consisting
of a number of scales (generally more than in the male), containing one
flower. Corol; none. Pistil; germ single, ovate. Styles; two, long,
slender, and spreading. Stigmas; single and acute. Seed-vessel; an
oblong drupe, covered with the calix. Seed; an ovate nut, with one cell.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Specific Description.</span>​&mdash;The anchar is one of the largest trees in the
forests of Java. The stem is cylindrical, perpendicular, and rises completely
naked to the height of sixty, seventy, or eighty feet. Near the
surface of the ground it spreads obliquely, dividing into numerous broad
appendages or wings, much like the canarium commune (the canary-tree),
and several other of our large forest trees. It is covered with a whitish
bark, slightly bursting in longitudinal furrows. Near the ground this
bark is, in old trees, more than half an inch thick, and upon being
wounded yields plentifully the milky juice from which the celebrated
poison is prepared. A puncture or incision being made into the tree, the
juice or sap appears oozing out of a yellowish colour (somewhat frothy)
from old, paler or nearly white from young trees; exposed to the air,
its surface becomes brown. The consistence very much resembles milk:
it is more thick and viscid. This sap is contained in the true bark (or
cortex), which, when punctured, yields a considerable quantity, so that
in a short time a cup-full may be collected from a large tree. The inner
bark (or liber) is of a close fibrous texture, like that of the morus papyrifera,
and when separated from the other bark, and cleansed from
the adhering particles, resembles a coarse piece of linen. It has been
worked into ropes, which are very strong; and the poorer class of people
employ the inner bark of the younger trees, which is more easily
prepared, for the purpose of making a coarse stuff which they wear in
working in the fields. But it requires much bruising, washing, and a long
immersion, before it can be used, and when it appears completely purified,
persons wearing this dress being exposed to rain, are affected with
an intolerable itching, which renders their flimsy covering insupportable.
It will appear from the account of the manner in which the poison is
prepared, that the deleterious quality exists in the gum; a small portion
of which still adhering, produces, when exposed to wet, this irritating
effect: and it is singular, that this property of the prepared bark is known
to the Javans in all places where the tree grows, while the preparation of
a poison from its juice, which produces a mortal effect when introduced
into the body by pointed weapons, is an exclusive art of the inhabitants
of the eastern extremity of the island. The stem of the anchar having
arrived at the above-mentioned height, sends off a few stout branches,
which spreading nearly horizontally with several irregular curves, divide
into smaller branches, and form a hemispherical, not very regular, crown.
Previous to the season of flowering, about the beginning of June, the
tree sheds its leaves, which reappear when the male flowers have completed
the office of fecundation. It delights in a fertile, not very elevated,
soil, and is only found in the largest forests. One of the experiments
to be related below was made with the upas prepared by myself.
In the collection of the juice I had some difficulty in inducing the inhabitants
to assist me; they feared a cutaneous eruption and inflammation,
resembling (according to the account they gave of it) that produced
by the ingas of this island, the rhus vernix of Japan, and the rhus
radicans of North America. The anchar, like the trees in its neighbourhood,
is on all sides surrounded by shrubs and plants: in no instance
have I observed the ground naked or barren in its immediate circumference.
The largest tree I met with in Balambangan, was so closely
environed by the common trees and shrubs of the forest in which it
grew, that it was with difficulty I could approach it. Several vines and
climbing shrubs, in complete health and vigour, adhered to it, and ascended
to nearly half its height; and, at the time I visited the tree and
collected the juice, I was forcibly struck with the egregious misrepresentation
of Foersch. Several young trees spontaneously sprung from
seeds that had fallen from the parent, put me in mind of a line in Darwin's
Botanic Garden:​&mdash;
</p>
<p>
'Chain'd at his root two scion-demons dwell;'
</p>
<p>
while in recalling his beautiful description of the upas, my vicinity to
the tree gave me reason to rejoice that it was founded in fiction.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Description of the Chetik.</span>​&mdash;The fructification of the chetik is
still unknown: after all possible research in the district where it grows,
I have not been able to find it in a flowering state. It is a large
winding shrub. The root extends creeping a considerable distance
parallel to the surface, sending off small fibres at different curves, while
the main root strikes perpendicularly into the ground. The stem,
which in general is shrubby, sometimes acquires the size of a small tree.
The poison is prepared from the bark of the root. The chetik grows
only in close, shady, almost inaccessible forests, in a deep, black, fertile
vegetable mould. It is very rarely met with even in the wildernesses
of Balambangan.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Preparation of the Poison from the Anchar.</span>​&mdash;This process
was performed for me by an old Javan, who was celebrated for his
superior skill in preparing the poison: about eight ounces of the juice
of the anchar, which had been collected the preceding evening in the
usual manner, and been preserved in the joint of a bambu, was carefully
strained into a bowl. The sap of the following substances, which
had been finely grated and bruised, was carefully expressed and poured
into it, viz. arum (nampu), kempferia galanga (kenchur), anomum
(bengli) a variety of zerumbed, common onion and garlic, of each about
half a drachm. The same quantity of finely powdered black pepper was
then added, and the mixture stirred. The preparer now took an entire
fruit of capsicum fruticosum or Guinea pepper, and having opened it,
he carefully separated a single seed, and placed it on the fluid in the
middle of the bowl. It immediately began to reel round rapidly, now
forming a regular circle, then darting towards the margin of the vessel,
with a perceptible commotion on the surface of the liquor, which continued
about one minute. Being completely at rest, the same quantity
of pepper was again added, and another seed of the capsicum laid on as
before. A similar commotion took place in the fluid, but in a less
degree, and the seed was carried round with diminished rapidity. The
addition of the same quantity of pepper was repeated a third time,
when a seed of the capsicum being carefully placed in the centre of the
fluid, remained quiet, forming a regular circle about itself in the fluid,
resembling the halo of the moon. This is considered as a sign that the
preparation of the poison is complete.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Preparation of the Poison from the Chetik.</span>​&mdash;The bark of
the root is carefully separated and cleared of all the adherent earth, a
proportionate quantity of water is poured on, and it is boiled about an
hour, when the fluid is carefully filtered through a white cloth; it
is then exposed to the fire again, and boiled down to nearly the consistence
of an extract; in this state it much resembles a thick syrup.
The following spices, having been prepared as above described, are
added in the same proportion as to the anchar, viz. kempferia galanga
(kenchur), (súnti), anomum zingéber (shai), common onion, garlic, and
black pepper. The expressed juice of these is poured into the vessel,
which is once more exposed to the fire for a few minutes, when
the preparation is complete. The upas of both kinds must be preserved
in very close vessels."
</p>
<p>
Dr. H. then details the particulars of twenty experiments made on different
animals with these poisons, as well in their simple state as procured
from the bark, powerfully prepared in the manner as above stated,
in which the violence of the poison was manifested; and concludes with
some general observations, from which the following are extracted:
</p>
<p>
"The operation of the two different poisons on the animal system is
essentially different. The first seventeen experiments were made with
the anchar. The rapidity of its effect depends in a great degree upon
the size of the vessel wounded, and on the quantity of poison carried
into the circulation. In the first experiment, it induced death in
twenty-six minutes: in the second, which was made with the sap
collected at Púgar, in thirteen minutes. The poison from different
parts of the island has been found nearly equal in activity.
The common train of symptoms is; a trembling and shivering of
the extremities, restlessness, erection of the hair, discharges from
the bowels, drooping and faintness, slight spasms and convulsions,
hasty breathing, an increased flow of saliva, spasmodic contractions of
the pectoral and abdominal muscles, retching, vomiting, excrementitious
vomiting, frothy vomiting, great agony, laborious breathing,
repeated convulsions, and death. The effects are nearly the same on
quadrupeds, in whatever part of the body the wound is made. It sometimes
acts with so much force, that not all the symptoms enumerated
are observed. In these cases, after the premonitory symptoms (tremors,
twitchings, faintness, an increased flow of saliva), the convulsions come
on suddenly, and are quickly followed by death. The upas appears to
affect quadrupeds with nearly equal force, proportionate in some degree
to their size and disposition. To dogs it proved mortal in most experiments
within an hour; a mouse died in ten minutes; a monkey in
seven; a cat in fifteen; a buffalo, one of the largest quadrupeds of the
island, died in two hours and ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
"If the simple or unprepared sap is mixed with the extract of tobacco,
instead of the spices mentioned, it is rendered equally, perhaps more,
active. Even the pure juice, unmixed and unprepared, appears to act
with a force equal to that which has undergone the preparative process.
Birds are very differently affected by this poison. Fowls have a peculiar
capacity to resist its effects: a fowl died in twenty-four hours after the
wound; others have recovered after being partially affected.
</p>
<p>
"The eighteenth and succeeding experiments were made with the
poison prepared from the chetik. Its operation is far more violent and
rapid than that of the anchar, and it affects the animal system in a different
manner. While the anchar operates chiefly on the stomach, alimentary
canal, the respiration and circulation, the chetik is determined
to the brain and nervous system: a relative comparison of the appearances
on dissection, demonstrates in a striking manner the peculiar
operation of each. A general view of the effects of the chetik on quadrupeds
is given in these experiments. After the previous symptoms
of faintness, drowsiness, and slight convulsions, it acts by a sudden
impulse, which like a violent apoplexy prostrates at once the whole
nervous system. In two of these experiments this sudden effect took
place in the sixth minute after the wound, in another in the seventh
minute: the animals suddenly started, fell down head foremost, and
continued in convulsions until death ensued. This poison affects fowls
in a much more violent manner than that of the anchar. They are first
affected by a heat and itching of the breast and wings, which they shew
by violently pecking those parts; this is followed by a loose discharge
from the bowels, when they are seized with tremors and fluttering of the
wings, which having continued a short time, they fall down head foremost,
and continue convulsed till death. In some instances, particularly
young fowls, the poison acts with great rapidity; death has frequently
occurred within the space of a minute after a puncture with a poisoned
dart.
</p>
<p>
"Taken into the stomach of quadrupeds, the chetik acts as a most
violent poison; but it requires about thrice the period to produce the
same effect which a wound produces. But the stomach of fowls can
resist its operation. Having mixed about double the quantity generally
adhering to a dart with the food of a fowl, it consumed it without
shewing any marks of indisposition. The poison of the anchar does by
no means act as violently on quadrupeds as that of the chetik. I have
given it to a dog: it produced at first nearly the same symptoms as a
puncture; oppression of the head, twitchings, faintness, laborious
respiration, violent contraction of the pectoral and abdominal muscles,
&amp;c. which continued nearly two hours; but after the complete evacuation
of the stomach by vomiting, the animal gradually recovered.
</p>
<p>
"I have but little to add concerning the operation of the anchar on the
human system. The only credible information on this subject is contained
in the work of Rhumphius, who had an opportunity of personally
observing the effect of the poisoned darts and arrows as they were
used by the natives of Makasar, in their attack on Amboyna about the
year 1650. They were also employed by the inhabitants of Celebes in
their former wars with the Dutch. Speaking of their operation he says,
'the poison touching the warm blood, it is instantly carried through
the whole body, so that it may be felt in all the veins, and causes an
excessive burning, particularly in the head, which is followed by
fainting and death.' This poison (according to the same author)
possesses different degrees of virulence, according to its age and state
of preservation. The most powerful is called upas raja, and its effects
are considered as incurable; the other kinds are distributed among the
soldiers on going to war. After having proved mortal to many of the
Dutch soldiers in Amboyna and Makasar, they finally discovered an
almost infallible remedy in the root of the radix toxicaria of Rhumphius,
which, if timely applied, counteracted, by its violent emetic
effect, the force of the upas. An intelligent Javan of Banyuwangi
informed me, that a number of years ago an inhabitant of that district
was wounded in a clandestine manner, by an arrow thrown from a blow-pipe,
in the fore-arm, near the articulation of the elbow. In about
fifteen minutes he became drowsy; after which he was seized with
vomiting, became delirious, and in less than half an hour he died. From
the experiments above related, we may form an analogous estimate of
its probable effects on man." <em>Batavian Transactions</em>, vol. vii.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Vol I Pg 62]</a></span></p></div></div>

<p>The inhabitants of Java seem to owe their origin to the same
stock, from which most of the islands lying to the south of the
eastern Peninsula of Asia appear to have been first peopled.
This stock is evidently Tartar, and has, by its numerous and
wide-spreading branches, not only extended itself over the
Indian Archipelago, but over the neighbouring Continent.
"To judge from external appearance, that is to say, from
shape, size, and feature," observes Dr. Francis Buchanan,
in his Notices on the Birman Empire<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, "there is one very
extensive nation that inhabits the east of Asia. It includes
the eastern and western Tartars of the Chinese authors, the
Calmucs, the Chinese, the Japanese, and other tribes inhabiting
what is called the Peninsula of India beyond the
Ganges, and the islands to the south and east of this, as
far at least as New Guinea."​&mdash;"This nation," adds the same
author, "may be distinguished by a short, squat, robust,
fleshy stature, and by features highly different from those of
an European. The face is somewhat in shape of a lozenge,
the forehead and chin being sharpened, whilst at the cheek
bones it is very broad. The eyebrows, or superciliary ridges,
in this nation, project very little, and the eyes are very
narrow, and placed rather obliquely in the head, the external
angles being the highest. The nose is very small,
but has not, like that of the negro, the appearance of being
flattened, and the apertures of the nostrils, which in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Vol I Pg 63]</a></span>European are linear and parallel, in them are nearly circular
and divergent, for the <em>septum narium</em> being much
thickest towards the face, places them entirely out of the
parallel line. The mouths of this nation are in general well
shaped; their hair is harsh, lank, and black. Those of
them that live even in the highest climates do not obtain the
deep hue of the negro or Hindu; nor do such of them as
live in the coldest climates acquire the clear bloom of the
European."</p>

<p>But although the Javans are to be included under this
general description, it does not follow that they bear an exact,
or very striking resemblance, in person and feature, to the
Chinese or Japanese, nor even that they are liable to be confounded
with the Birmans or Siamese. From the former,
indeed, they are far removed by many obvious characteristics;
and though more nearly resembling the latter, they possess
many peculiarities, which mark them out to the most careless
observer as a race distinct and separate for ages, though still
retaining general traces of a common origin. As we approach
the limits of savage life, and recur to that inartificial, unimproved
state of society, in which the primitive divergence may
be supposed to have taken place, we shall find the points of
resemblance increased, and the proofs of a common descent
multiplied. The less civilized of the tribes inhabiting the
islands, approach so nearly, in physical appearance, to that
portion of the inhabitants of the Peninsula, which has felt least
of the Chinese influence on the one side, and of the Birman and
Siamese on the other, and exhibit so striking an affinity in their
usages and customs, as to warrant the hypothesis that the tide
of population originally flowed towards the islands, from that
quarter of the Continent lying between Siam and China. But
at what era this migration commenced; whether, in the first
instance, it was purely accidental and subsequently gradual;
or whether, originally, it was undertaken from design, and
accelerated, at any particular periods, by political convulsions
on the Continent, we cannot at present determine with any
certainty, as we have no data on which to rely with confidence.
It is probable, however, that the islands were peopled
at a very remote period, and long before the Birman
and Siamese nations rose into notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Vol I Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever opinion may be formed on the identity of the
tribes inhabiting these Islands and the neighbouring Peninsula,
the striking resemblance in person, feature, language,
and customs, which prevails throughout the whole Archipelago,
justifies the conclusion, that its original population issued
from the same source, and that the peculiarities which distinguish
the different nations and communities into which it is at
present distributed, are the result of a long separation, local
circumstances, and the intercourse of foreign traders, emigrants,
or settlers.</p>

<p>Excluding the Philippines, as distant from the scene of
our present observations, it may be noticed, that of the three
chief nations in these islands, occupying respectively Java,
Sumatra, and Celebes, the first has, especially by its moral
habits, by its superior civilization and improvements, obtained
a broader and more marked characteristic than the others.
Both the Malayan and <em>Búgis</em> nations are maritime and commercial,
devoted to speculations of gain, animated by a spirit
of adventure, and accustomed to distant and hazardous enterprises;
while the Javans, on the contrary, are an agricultural
race, attached to the soil, of quiet habits and contented dispositions,
almost entirely unacquainted with navigation and
foreign trade, and little inclined to engage in either. This
difference of character may perhaps be accounted for, by the
great superiority of the soil of Java to that of the other
two islands.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted, that our information on the state and
progress of society in these islands is scanty, as Europeans
only became acquainted with them when they were on their
decline. The Malayan empire, which once extended over all
Sumatra<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, and the capital of which is still nominally at <em>Menáng-kábaù</em>
on that island, had long been dismembered; but
its colonies were found established on the coasts of the Peninsula
and throughout the Islands, as far east as the Moluccas.
The Mahometan institutions had considerably obliterated their
ancient character, and had not only obstructed their improvement,
but had accelerated their decline. Traditional history
concurs with existing monuments, in proving them to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Vol I Pg 65]</a></span>formerly made considerable advances in those arts, to which
their industry and ingenuity were particularly directed, and
they still bear marks of that higher state of civilization which
they once enjoyed.</p>

<p>What the Malayan empire was on Sumatra, in the western
part of the Archipelago, that of <em>Guah</em> or <em>Mengkásar</em>, was on
Celebes in the east; but the people of this latter nation, whom
we may generally designate by the name of <em>Búgis</em>, had not
been equally influenced by foreign settlers nor exposed to the
inroads of the Arab missionaries, and they consequently maintained
their ancient worship and their native institutions for a
longer period. Like the <em>Maláyus</em>, they sent forth numerous
colonies, and at one period extended the success of their arms
as far west as Acheen on Sumatra, and <em>Kéddah</em> on the Malayan
peninsula, and in almost every part of the Archipelago, Malayan
and <em>Búgis</em> settlers and establishments are to be found.</p>

<p>The Javans, on the contrary, being an agricultural people,
are seldom met with out of their native island. At one period
of their history, indeed, their power seems to have been exerted
in acquiring or perpetuating foreign dominion, and they
seem to have sent out colonies to Borneo, the Peninsula, Sumatra,
and probably Celebes: but when Europeans became
acquainted with them, their external influence appears to have
been contracted, and their sovereignty nearly confined within
the limits of Java itself. Their foreign establishments thus receiving
from them no protection, and deriving no advantage
from nominal obedience, declared their independence: and,
having but little communication with the mother-country,
soon became assimilated to the character, and merged into the
body of the Malayan nation.</p>

<p>The comparative advancement of these three nations in the
arts of civilized life, seems to be directly as the fertility of the
soil they occupied, or the inducements they held out to foreign
intercourse; and inversely, as the indulgence of their own
roving, adventurous spirit, and piratical habits. The arts
never fix their roots but in a crowded population, and a
crowded population is generally created only on a fertile territory.
Egypt, from the fertility of soil and the consequent
density of its population, led the way in science and refinement
among ancient nations; while the sterile tracts conti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Vol I Pg 66]</a></span>guous
to that favoured land have been inhabited, from primeval
times, by dispersed tribes of unimproved barbarians. In like
manner, Java having become populous from its natural fertility,
and having, by its wealth and the salubrity of its
climate, invited the visits of more enlightened strangers, soon
made great progress in arts and knowledge; while the <em>Búgis</em>,
being more deficient in these advantages, have been left considerably
behind in the race of improvement. They may lay
claim, however, to the most originality of character.</p>

<p>It will be the object of another part of this work, to trace
the source of that foreign influence, to which these three
nations are principally indebted for their civilization: here,
therefore, it may not be necessary to advert to the circumstance
further, than by generally observing, that from western
Asia they received the rudiments and impulse of improvement;
an inference abundantly justified by the extensive remains of
the arts, institutions, and languages of that country, which are
still to be found throughout the Archipelago.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Java and Madúra are in stature rather
below the middle size, though not so short as the <em>Búgis</em> and
many of the other islanders. They are, upon the whole, well
shaped, though less remarkably so than the <em>Maláyus</em>, and
erect in their figures. Their limbs are slender, and the wrists
and ankles particularly small. In general, they allow the body
to retain its natural shape. The only exceptions to this observation
are, an attempt to prevent the growth, or to reduce the
size of the waist, by compressing it into the narrowest limits;
and the practice still more injurious to female elegance, of
drawing too tightly that part of the dress which covers the
bosom. Deformity is very rare among them. The forehead is
high, the eyebrows well marked and distant from the eyes,
which are somewhat Chinese, or rather Tartar, in the formation
of the inner angle. The colour of the eye is dark; the
nose small and somewhat flat, but less so than that of the
islanders in general. The mouth is well formed, but the lips
are large, and their beauty generally injured by the practice of
filing and dyeing the teeth black, and by the use of tobacco,
<em>sári</em>, &amp;c. The cheek-bones are usually prominent; the beard
very scanty; the hair of the head generally lank and black,
but sometimes waving in curls, and partially tinged with a
deep reddish brown colour. The countenance is mild, placid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Vol I Pg 67]</a></span>
and thoughtful, and easily expresses respect, gaiety, earnestness,
indifference, bashfulness, or anxiety.</p>

<p>In complexion, the Javans, as well as the other eastern
islanders, may be considered rather as a yellow than a copper-coloured
or black race. Their standard of beauty, in this
respect, is "a virgin-gold colour:" except perhaps in some
few districts in the mountainous parts of the country, where a
ruddy tinge is occasioned by the climate, they want the degree
of red requisite to give them a copperish hue. It may be
observed, however, that they are generally darker than the
tribes of the neighbouring islands; especially the inhabitants
of the eastern districts, who may indeed be considered as
having more delicate features, and bearing a more distinct
impression of Indian colonization, than those of the Western
or <em>Súnda</em> districts. The <em>Súndas</em> exhibit many features of a
mountainous race. They are shorter, stouter, hardier, and
more active men, than the inhabitants of the coast and eastern
districts. In some respects they resemble the Madurese, who
display a more martial and independent air, and move with a
bolder carriage than the natives of Java. A considerable difference
exists in person and features between the higher and
lower classes; more indeed than seems attributable to difference
of employment and treatment. The features and limbs
of the chiefs are more delicate, and approach more nearly to
those of the inhabitants of Western India, while those of the
common people retain more marked traces of the stock from
which the islands were originally peopled. In colour there
are many different shades in different families and different
districts, some being much darker than others. Among many
of the chiefs a strong mixture of the Chinese is clearly discernible:
the Arab features are seldom found, except among
the priests, and some few families of the highest rank.</p>

<p>The women, in general, are not so good-looking as the men:
and to Europeans many of them, particularly when advanced
in years, appear hideously ugly. But among the lower orders,
much of this deficiency of personal comeliness is doubtless to
be attributed to the severe duties which they have to perform
in the field, to the hardships they have to undergo in carrying
oppressive burdens, and to exposure in a sultry climate. On
the neighbouring island of <em>Báli</em>, where the condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Vol I Pg 68]</a></span>
women among the peasantry does not appear by any means so
oppressed and degraded, they exhibit considerable personal
beauty; and even on Java, the higher orders of them being kept
within-doors, have a very decided superiority in this respect.</p>

<p>In manners the Javans are easy and courteous, and respectful
even to timidity; they have a great sense of propriety,
and are never rude or abrupt. In their deportment they are
pliant and graceful, the people of condition carrying with
them a considerable air of fashion, and receiving the gaze
of the curious without being at all disconcerted. In their
delivery they are in general very circumspect and even slow,
though not deficient in animation when necessary.</p>

<p>Here, as on Sumatra, there are certain mountainous districts,
in which the people are subject to those large wens
in the throat, termed in Europe <em>goitres</em>. The cause is generally
ascribed by the natives to the quality of the water; but
there seems good ground for concluding, that it is rather to be
traced to the atmosphere. In proof of this it may be mentioned,
that there is a village near the foot of the <em>Teng'gar</em>
mountains, in the eastern part of the island, where every
family is afflicted by this malady, while in another village,
situated at a greater elevation, and through which the stream
descends which serves for the use of both, there exists no such
deformity. These wens are considered hereditary in some families,
and seem thus independent of situation. A branch of
the family of the present <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Bándung</em> is subject to
them, and it is remarkable that they prevail chiefly among the
women in that family. They neither produce positive suffering
nor occasion early death, and may be considered rather as deformities
than diseases. It is never attempted to remove them.</p>

<p>The population of Java is very unequally distributed, whether
we consider the fertility or the extent of the districts over which
it is spread. The great mass of it lies in the eastern and native
districts, as will be perceived from the annexed tables.</p>

<p>The table No. I., is compiled from materials collected by a
committee appointed on the first establishment of the British
government, to enquire and report on the state of the country.
It will be found to illustrate, in some degree, the proportionate
numbers of the different ranks and classes of society in the
island. Beyond this, however, it cannot be depended upon,
as the returns of which it is an abstract were made at a period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Vol I Pg 69]</a></span>
when the Dutch system of administration provisionally remained
in force; and every new enquiry into the state of the
country being at that time considered by the people as a prelude
to some new tax or oppression, it became an object with
them to conceal the full extent of the population: accordingly
it was found to differ essentially in amount from the results of
information subsequently obtained on the introduction of the
detailed land-revenue settlement, when an agreement with each
individual cultivator becoming necessary to the security of his
possession, he seldom failed to satisfy the necessary enquiries.
The table No. II., here exhibited, at least as far as regards the
European provinces, may therefore be considered as faithful a
view of the population of the country as could be expected, and
as such, notwithstanding the inaccuracies to which all such
accounts are liable, it is presented with some confidence to the
public.</p>

<p>It was formed in the following manner. A detailed account
of the peasantry of each village was first taken, containing the
name of each male inhabitant, with other particulars, and from
the aggregate of these village lists a general statement was constructed
of the inhabitants of each subdivision and district. An
abstract was again drawn up from these provincial accounts,
exhibiting the state of each residency in which the districts
were respectively included, and the totals of these last, collected
into one tabular view, constitute the present abstract.
The labour of this detailed survey was considerable, for as
each individual cultivator was to receive a lease corresponding
with the register taken, it was necessary that the land he rented
should be carefully measured and assessed<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Vol I Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>By the last table, it appears that in some districts the population
is in the ratio of two hundred and eighty-one to a square
mile, while in others it is not more than twenty-four and three
quarters: in the districts of <em>Banyuwángí</em> it is even as low as
seven. The soil in the eastern districts is generally considered
superior to that in the western, and this circumstance, added
to the superior facilities which they afford to commerce, may
serve to account for their original selection as the chief seat of
the native government, and consequently for their denser population
at an early period.</p>

<p>This disproportion was also promoted by the policy of the
Dutch Company. The Dutch first established themselves in
the western division, and having no confidence in the natives,
endeavoured to drive them from the vicinity of Batavia, with
the view of establishing round their metropolis an extensive
and desert barrier. The forced services and forced deliveries,
which extended wherever Dutch influence could be felt, and
of which more will be said hereafter, contributed to impoverish,
and thereby to depopulate the country. The drain also of the
surrounding districts, to supply the place of the multitudes
who perished by the unhealthy climate of Batavia, must have
been enormous; and if to these we add the checks to population,
which were created over Bantam, the <em>Priáng'en</em> Regencies,
and Chéribon, in the pepper and coffee cultivation, of the
nature of which an account will be given when treating of the
agriculture of the country, we need go no further to account for
the existing disproportion. It was only about sixty years ago
that the Dutch government first obtained a decided influence in
the eastern districts, and from that moment, the provinces subjected
to its authority ceased to improve, and extensive emigrations
took place into the dominions of the native princes. Such
were the effects of this desolating system, that the population
of the province of <em>Banyuwángi</em>, which in 1750 is said to have
amounted to upwards of eighty thousand souls, was in 1811
reduced to eight thousand.</p>

<p>The <em>Priáng'en</em> Regencies, from their inland situation and
mountainous character, may probably have at all times been
less closely peopled than other parts of the island, and their
insufficient population would furnish no proofs of the oppressions
of government, did we not observe extensive tracts, nay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Vol I Pg 72]</a></span>
whole districts, exhibiting the traces of former cultivation, now
lying waste and overgrown with long rank grass. Chéribon
and Bantam have shared the same fate. These provinces, according
to authentic accounts, were at the period of the first
establishment of the European government, among the richest
and most populous of the island. In 1811 they were found in
a state of extreme poverty, affording little or no revenue, and
distracted by all the aggravated miseries of continued insurrections.</p>

<p>If we look at Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, the capitals
of the British government in India: if we look at the great
cities of every nation in Europe; nay, if we even confine ourselves
to the capitals of the native princes on Java, we shall
find that population has always accumulated in their vicinity.
And why was not this the case with the Dutch capital? The
climate alone will not explain it. Bad government was the
principal cause; a system of policy which secured neither
person nor property​&mdash;selfish, jealous, vexatious, and tyrannical.
It is no less true than remarkable, that wherever the
Dutch influence has prevailed in the Eastern Seas, depopulation
has followed. The Moluccas particularly have suffered at
least as much as any part of Java, and the population of those
Islands, reduced as it is, has been equally oppressed and degraded.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for the interests of humanity, and for the
importance of Java, that the native governments were less
oppressive than the sway of their European conquerors, and
that their states afforded a retreat from a more desolating
tyranny. It has been ascertained, that, on the first establishment
of the Dutch in the eastern part of the Island, the inhabitants
of whole districts at once migrated into the native
provinces. Every new act of rigour, every unexpected exaction,
occasioned a further migration, and cultivation was
transferred to tracts which had previously scarcely a family on
them. This state of things continued down to the latest date
of the Dutch government. During the administration of
Marshal Daendels, in the years 1808, 1809, and 1810, nearly
all the inhabitants of the province of <em>Demák</em>, one of the richest
in the eastern districts, fled into the native provinces; and
when an order was given for the rigid enforcement of the coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Vol I Pg 73]</a></span>
monopoly, every district suffered in its population, in proportion
to the extent of service levied upon it. Of the sacrifice of
lives by thousands and tens of thousands, to fill the ranks of the
Dutch native army, and to construct roads and public works,
we shall speak more at large hereafter.</p>

<p>The total population of Java and Madúra appears from the
Table No. II., to amount to 4,615,270, of which about four
millions and a half may be considered as the indigenous population
of the country, and the rest as foreign settlers. Itinerants,
who are principally found along the coast in the different
maritime and commercial capitals, are not included; neither is
the nautical population, which cannot be estimated at less than
30,000 souls; so that the whole population of these two
islands may, perhaps, be taken in round numbers at not much
less than five millions. Of these not less than three millions
are in the provinces immediately subject to European authority,
and upwards of a million and a half in the provinces of
the native princes.</p>

<p>While the British were in possession of Java, there is reason
to believe that the population of the Island was rapidly increasing;
that of the provinces immediately under the European
authority was certainly augmented by the return of numerous
families from emigration: but previously to that period, no such
authentic registers were kept as might enable us to ascertain
with precision the variations in the number of the inhabitants
during the Dutch government.</p>

<p>Nothing can more completely shew the vague and defective
information formerly attainable on this subject, than the loose
and contradictory statements published by those who took
most pains to be well informed, and who felt it their duty to
collect all the light that could be attained. In some accounts
which have met the public eye, the population of Java is placed
on a level with that of the most powerful European states, and
assumed as high as thirty millions, while in others, where one
would expect more accuracy<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, it is rated at only a million.
The most respectable authorities<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> state the population about
a century ago at three millions; but the slightest reflection will
convince us, that such an estimate must have proceeded upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Vol I Pg 74]</a></span>data merely conjectural, for from our knowledge of the Dutch
maxims of administration we may safely say, that until very
lately, they never thought it an object to prosecute statistic
enquiries, and that if ever they had done so, under the old
system, they could have obtained no results deserving of confidence
or credit.</p>

<p>About the year 1750, a certain number of families were
assigned by the stipulations of a treaty to one of the native
princes<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>; and on his death, about thirty years afterwards,
when an account was taken of this population, it appeared
that the number of families had nearly doubled. But this increase
cannot be taken as the average increase of the Island,
for at this period the native provinces received a considerable
accession to their numbers, in consequence of the emigrations
from the Dutch territories.</p>

<p>If any inference can be drawn from this and other corresponding
circumstances, it would seem, that notwithstanding
the drains on the existing race, and the preventive checks to
an increase, which were experienced during the latter years of
the Dutch administration, the island was actually more populous
in 1811, when it was surrendered to the British, than in
1750, when at the termination of a destructive war, the Dutch
acquired the greatest portion of it from the natives.</p>

<p>To support the opinion of an increase within the last half
century (which is every where asserted) we have the assurance,
that during that period the greatest internal tranquillity prevailed
in the provinces subject to native administration; that
no years of scarcity and famine were experienced, and that the
island was blessed with genial seasons and abundance of subsistence.
But to place in the opposite scale, we have the
government oppressions to which we formerly alluded, and
which one would suppose sufficient to counteract the natural
tendency of these advantages. As demonstrative of the strength
of that principle of population, which could even maintain its
stationary amount in conflict with political drains and discouragements,
it may be proper to mention cursorily a few of them.
Great demands were, at all times, made on the peasantry of the
island, to recruit the ranks of the Dutch army, and to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Vol I Pg 75]</a></span>
the many other wants of the public service; the severities and
consequent mortality to which the troops were liable, may be
calculated, from the reluctance of the unfortunate wretches,
selected as victims of military conscription, to engage in the
duties of a military life. Confined in unhealthy garrisons,
exposed to unnecessary hardships and privations, extraordinary
casualties took place among them, and frequent new levies became
necessary, while the anticipation of danger and suffering
produced an aversion to the service, which was only aggravated
by the subsequent measures of cruelty and oppression. The
conscripts raised in the provinces were usually sent to the metropolis
by water; and though the distance be but short between
any two points of the island, a mortality, similar to that of a slave-ship
in the middle passage, took place on board these receptacles
of reluctant recruits. They were generally confined in the
stocks till their arrival at Batavia, and it is calculated that for
every man that entered the army and performed the duties of a
soldier, several lives were lost. Besides the supply of the army,
one half of the male population of the country was constantly
held in readiness for other public services; and thus a great
portion of the effective hands were taken from their families,
and detained at a distance from home, in labours which broke
their spirit and exhausted their strength. During the administration
of Marshal Daendels, it has been calculated that the
construction of public roads alone, destroyed the lives of at
least ten thousand workmen. The transport of government
stores, and the capricious requisitions of government agents of
all classes, perpetually harassed, and frequently carried off
numbers of the people. If to these drains we add the waste of
life occasioned by insurrections, which tyranny and impolicy
excited and fomented in Chéribon, the blighting effects of the
coffee monopoly, and forced services in the <em>Priáng'en</em> Regencies,
and the still more desolating operation of the policy pursued
and consequent anarchy produced in the province of
Bantam, we shall have some idea of the depopulating causes
that existed under the Dutch administration, and the force of
that tendency to increase, which could overcome obstacles so
powerful.</p>

<p>Most of these drains and checks were removed during the
short period of British administration; but it is to be regretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Vol I Pg 76]</a></span>
(so far as accurate data on this subject would be desirable) that
there was not time to learn satisfactorily the result of a different
system, or to institute the proper registers, by which
alone questions of population can be determined. The only
document of that kind, to which I can venture to refer as authentic,
is a statement of the births and deaths that occurred in
the given general population of the <em>Priáng'en</em> Regencies for
one year. From this account it would appear, that even in
these Regencies, where, if we except Batavia, the checks to
population are allowed to be greater than elsewhere, the births
were to the total existing population as 1 to 39, and the deaths
as 1 to 40 very nearly; that the births exceed the deaths by
618, or about 1 in 40, in a population of 232,000, and that, at
that rate, the population would double itself in three hundred
and seventy-five years. A slow increase, certainly, compared
with England, where the births, in the three years ending
1800, were to the persons alive as 1 in 36, and the deaths as
1 to 49, and where, consequently, the nation would double
itself in one hundred and sixty years (or taking the enumeration
of 1811 as more correct, where the population would be
doubled in eighty years): but not much slower than that of
France, where, according to the statements of numbers in 1700
and 1790, about three hundred years would be required to
double the inhabitants. It has been estimated that the population
in some more favourable districts would double itself in
fifty years. One inference cannot fail to be drawn from the
register to which I have referred; that the births and deaths,
though they nearly approach each other, are low, compared
with the existing numbers; and that, consequently, the climate
is healthy, and the marriages not very prolific, as far as
this district is concerned.</p>

<p>In the absence of authentic documents, which would have
enabled us to resolve many interesting questions regarding the
population, such as the number of children to a marriage, the
ordinary length of life, the proportion of children that die in
infancy and at the other stages of life, the ratio between the
births and deaths, and the consequent rate of increase, the
effect of polygamy and multiplied divorces, the comparative
healthiness of the towns and the villages, and several others,​&mdash;I
shall state a few observations on some of these heads, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Vol I Pg 77]</a></span>
few facts tending to shew, that under a better system of
government, or by the removal of a few of the checks that previously
existed, Java might, in a short time, be expected to be
better peopled.</p>

<p>The soil is in general extremely fertile, and can be brought
to yield its produce with little labour. Many of the best spots
still remain uncultivated, and several districts are almost desert
and neglected, which might be the seats of a crowded and
happy peasantry. In many places, the land does not require
to be cleared, as in America, from the overgrown vegetation of
primeval forests, but offers its services to the husbandman,
almost free from every obstruction to his immediate labours.
The agricultural life in which the mass of the people are
engaged, is on Java, as in every other country, the most
favourable to health. It not only favours the longevity of the
existing race, but conduces to its more rapid renewal, by
leading to early marriages and a numerous progeny. The
term of life is not much shorter than in the best climates of
Europe. A very considerable number of persons of both
sexes attain the advanced age of seventy or eighty, and some
even live to one hundred and upwards; nearly the same proportion
survive forty and fifty, as in other genial climates.</p>

<p>While life is thus healthy and prolonged, there are no
restraints upon the formation of family connexions, by the
scarcity of subsistence or the labour of supporting children.
Both sexes arrive at maturity very early, and the customs of
the country, as well as the nature of the climate, impel them
to marry young; the males at sixteen, and the females at
thirteen or fourteen years of age: though frequently the women
form connexions at nine or ten, and, as Montesquieu expresses
it, "infancy and marriage go together." The conveniences
which the married couple require are few and easily procured.
The impulse of nature is seldom checked by the experience of
present deficiencies, or the fear of future poverty. Subsistence
is procured without difficulty, and comforts are not wanting.
Children, who are for a very short period a burden to their
parents, become early the means of assistance and the source
of wealth. To the peasant who labours his field with his own
hand, and who has more land than he can bring into cultivation,
they grow up into a species of valuable property, a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Vol I Pg 78]</a></span>
treasure; while, during their infancy and the season of helplessness,
they take little from the fruits of his industry but bare
subsistence.</p>

<p>Their education costs him little or nothing; scarcely any
clothing is required, his hut needs very little enlargement, and
no beds are used. Many of them die in infancy from the
small-pox and other distempers, but never from scanty food or
criminal neglect of parents. The women of all classes suckle
their children, till we ascend to the wives of the regents and
of the sovereign, who employ nurses.</p>

<p>Though women soon arrive at maturity, and enter early into
the married state, they continue to bear children to an advanced
age, and it is no uncommon thing to see a grandmother
still making addition to her family. Great families are however
rare. Though there are some women who have borne
thirteen or fourteen children, the average is rather low than
otherwise. A <em>chácha</em>, or family, is generally less numerous
than in Europe, both from the circumstance that the young
men and women more early leave the houses of their parents
to form establishments for themselves, and from an injudicious
mode of labouring among women of the lower ranks. Miscarriages
among the latter are frequently caused by over-straining
themselves in carrying excessive burdens, and
performing oppressive field-work, during pregnancy. The
average number of persons in a family does not exceed four,
or four and a half. As the labour of the women is almost
equally productive with that of the men, female children
become as much objects of solicitude with their parents as
male: they are nursed with the same care, and viewed with
the same pride and tenderness. In no class of society are
children of either sex considered as an incumbrance, or the
addition to a family as a misfortune; marriage is therefore
almost universal. An unmarried man past twenty is seldom
to be met with, and an old maid is considered a curiosity.
Neither custom, law, or religion, enjoins celibacy on the priesthood,
or any other order of the community, and by none of
them is it practised. Although no strictness of principle, nor
strong sense of moral restraint, prevails in the intercourse of
the sexes, prostitution is not common, except in the capitals.</p>

<p>As the Javans are a quiet domestic people, little given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Vol I Pg 79]</a></span>
adventure, disinclined to foreign enterprise, not easily roused
to violence or bloodshed, and little disposed to irregularities
of any kind, there are but few families left destitute in consequence
of hazards incurred or crimes committed by their
natural protectors. The character of blood-thirsty revenge,
which has been attributed to all the inhabitants of the Indian
Archipelago, by no means applies to the people of Java; and
though, in all cases where justice is badly administered or
absolutely perverted, people may be expected to enforce their
rights or redress their grievances, rather by their own passions
than by an appeal to the magistrate, comparatively few lives
are lost on the island by personal affrays or private feuds.</p>

<p>Such are a few of the circumstances that would appear to
have encouraged an increase of population on Java. They
furnish no precise data on which to estimate its rapidity, or
to calculate the period within which it would be doubled, but
they allow us, if tranquillity and good government were enjoyed,
to anticipate a gradual progress in the augmentation
of inhabitants, and the improvements of the soil for a long
course of time. Suppose the quantity of land in cultivation
to be to the land still in a state of nature as one to seven,
which is probably near the truth, and that, in the ordinary
circumstances of the country, the population would double
itself in a century, it might go on increasing for three hundred
years to come. Afterwards the immense tracts of unoccupied
or thinly peopled territories on Sumatra, Borneo, and the numerous
islands scattered over the Archipelago, may be ready
to receive colonies, arts, and civilization from the metropolis
of the Indian seas. Commercial intercourse, friendly relations,
or political institutions, may bind these dispersed communities
in one great insular commonwealth. Its trade and
navigation might connect the centre of this great empire with
Japan, China, and the south-western countries of Asia. New
Holland, which the adventurous <em>Búgis</em> already frequent, and
which is not so far distant from Java as Russia is from
England, might be included in the circle, and colonies of
Javans settled on the north, might meet with the British
spreading from the south, over that immense and now uncultivated
region. If we could indulge ourselves in such reveries
with propriety, we might contemplate the present semi-bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Vol I Pg 80]</a></span>barous
condition, ignorance, and poverty of these innumerable
islands, exchanged for a state of refinement, prosperity, and
happiness.</p>

<p>I formerly alluded to the oppressions of government, as the
principal checks to the increase of population on Java. There
are many others, such as the small-pox, and other diseases,
which are common to that country with the rest of the world.
From the scattered state of the population, any contagious
distemper, such as the small-pox, was formerly less destructive
on Java, than in countries where the inhabitants are
more crowded into large towns, and it is hoped that, from
the establishment for vaccine inoculation which the British
government erected, and endeavoured to render permanent, its
ravages may, in time, be entirely arrested. The diseases most
peculiar to the country, and most dangerous at all ages, are
fevers and dysenteries: epidemics are rare. There are two
moral causes which, on their first mention, will strike every
one as powerfully calculated to counteract the principle of
population: I mean the facility of obtaining divorces, and the
practice of polygamy. A greater weight should not, however,
be given them than they deserve after a consideration of all
the circumstances. It is true, that separations often take place
on the slightest grounds, and new connexions are formed with
equal frivolity and caprice; but in whatever light morality
would view this practice, and however detrimental it would be
to population in a different state of society, by leaving the
children of the marriage so dissolved to neglect and want,
it has no such consequences on Java. Considering the age at
which marriages are usually contracted, the choice of the
parties cannot be always expected to be considerate or judicious.
It may be observed also that the women, although they
do not appear old at twenty, as Montesquieu remarks, certainly
sooner lose that influence over their husbands, which depends
upon their beauty and personal attractions, than they do in
colder climates. In addition to this, there is little moral
restraint among many classes of the community, and the
religious maxims and indulgences acted upon by the priesthood,
in regulating matrimonial sanctions, have no tendency
to produce constancy, or to repress inclination. Dissolutions
of marriage are, therefore, very frequent, and obtained upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Vol I Pg 81]</a></span>
slightest pretences; but, as children are always valuable, and
as there is very little trouble in rearing or providing for them, no
change of mate, in either party, leads to their abandonment or
neglect. Indeed, the ease of supporting children, which renders
the practice less detrimental to the increase of population, may
be one of the principal causes why it is generally followed and
so little checked. No professed prostitution or promiscuous
intercourse is the consequence of this weakness of the nuptial
tie. It is rather brittle than loose; it is easily dissolved, but
while it remains it generally insures fidelity.</p>

<p>Polygamy, though in all cases it must be injurious to population
and happiness, so far as it goes, is permitted on Java, as in
other Mahomedan countries, by religion and law, but not practiced
to any great extent. Perhaps the ease of obtaining
matrimonial separations, by admitting of successive changes of
wives, diminishes the desire of possessing more than one at a
time.</p>

<p>It is plain, likewise, that whatever be the law, the great
body of the people must have only one wife; and that, where
there is nearly an equality of number between the sexes, inequality
of wealth or power alone can create an unequal distribution
of women. On Java, accordingly, only the chiefs and
the sovereign marry more than one wife. All the chiefs, from
the regents downwards, can only, by the custom of the country,
have two; the sovereign alone has four. The regents, however,
have generally three or four concubines, and the sovereign
eight or ten. Some of the chiefs have an extraordinary
number of children; the late Regent of <em>Túban</em> is reputed to
have been the father of no fewer than sixty-eight. Such
appropriations of numerous women as wives or concubines,
were owing to the political power of native authorities over the
inferior classes; and as, by the new system, that power is
destroyed, the evil may to a certain extent be checked. If we
were to depend upon the statement of a writer whom Montesquieu
refers to, that in Bantam there were ten women to one
man, we should be led to conclude with him, that here was a
case particularly favourable to polygamy, and that such an
institution was here an appointment of nature, intended for the
multiplication of the species, rather than an abuse contributing
to check it. There is not the least foundation, however, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Vol I Pg 82]</a></span>
report. The proportion of males and females born in Bantam,
and over the whole of Java, is nearly the same as in Europe, and
as we find generally to exist, wherever accurate statements can
be obtained. From the information collected in a very careful
surrey of one part of the very province in question, the preponderance
seemed to be on the side of male children to an extraordinary
degree; the male children being about forty-two
thousand, and the females only thirty-five thousand five hundred.
There were formerly, it is true, great drains on the male
population, to which I have before alluded, and which, in the
advanced stages of life, might turn the balance on the other
side; but as they were never so destructive as to render polygamy
a political institution, so that institution was not carried to
such an extent, as to render it a peculiar obstacle to the progress
of population. Upon the whole, we may conclude that in Java,
under a mild government, there is a great tendency to an increase
in the number of inhabitants, and to the consequent improvement
and importance of the island.</p>

<p>Besides the natives, whose numbers, circumstances, and character
I have slightly mentioned, there is on Java a rapidly
increasing race of foreigners, who have emigrated from the
different surrounding countries. The most numerous and important
class of these is the Chinese, who already do not fall
far short of a hundred thousand; and who, with a system of free
trade and free cultivation, would soon accumulate tenfold, by
natural increase within the island, and gradual accessions of
new settlers from home. They reside principally in the three
capitals of Batavia, <em>Samárang</em>, and <em>Surabáya</em>, but they are to
be found in all the smaller capitals, and scattered over most
parts of the country. A great proportion of them are descended
from families who have been many generations on the island.
Additions are gradually making to their numbers. They arrive
at Batavia from China, to the amount of a thousand and more
annually, in Chinese junks, carrying three, four, and five hundred
each, without money or resources; but, by dint of their industry,
soon acquire comparative opulence. There are no
women on Java who come directly from China; but as the Chinese
often marry the daughters of their countrymen by Javan
women, there results a numerous mixed race, which is often
scarcely distinguishable from the native Chinese. The Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Vol I Pg 83]</a></span>
on their arrival generally marry a Javan woman, or purchase
a slave from the other islands. The progeny from this connexion,
or what may be termed the cross breed between
the Chinese and Javans, are called in the Dutch accounts
<em>pernákans</em>. Many return to China annually in the junks, but
by no means in the same numbers as they arrive.</p>

<p>The Chinese, in all matters of inheritance and minor affairs,
are governed by their own laws, administered by their own
chiefs, a captain and several lieutenants being appointed
by government for each society of them. They are distinct
from the natives, and are in a high degree more intelligent,
more laborious, and more luxurious. They are the life and
soul of the commerce of the country. In the native provinces
they are still farmers of the revenue, having formerly been so
throughout the island.</p>

<p>Although still numerous, they are considered to have much
decreased since the civil war in 1742, during which not only
a large proportion of the Chinese population was massacred
by the Dutch in the town of Batavia, but a decree of extermination
was proclaimed against them throughout the island.</p>

<p>The natives of the Coromandel and Malabar coast, who
reside on Java, are usually termed Moors. They appear to be
the remnant of a once extensive class of settlers; but their
numbers have considerably decreased, since the establishment
of the Dutch monopoly, and the absolute extinction of the
native trade with India, which we have reason to believe was
once very extensive. Trading vessels, in considerable numbers,
still continue to proceed from the Coromandel coast to Sumatra,
Penang, and Malacca, but they no longer frequent
Java.</p>

<p><em>Búgis</em> and <em>Maláyus</em> are established in all the maritime
capitals of Java. They have their own quarter of the town
allotted to them, in the same manner as the Chinese, and are
subject to the immediate authority of their respective captains.</p>

<p>Among the Arabs are many merchants, but the majority are
priests. Their principal resort is <em>Grésik</em>, the spot where
Mahomedanism was first extensively planted on Java. They
are seldom of genuine Arab birth, but mostly a mixed race,
between the Arabs and the natives of the islands.</p>

<p>There is another class of inhabitants, either foreigners them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Vol I Pg 84]</a></span>selves,
or the immediate descendants of foreigners, whose
peculiar situation and considerable numbers entitle them to
some notice in the general sketch of the population: I mean
the class of slaves. The native Javans are never reduced to
this condition; or if they should happen to be seized and sold
by pirates, a satisfactory proof of their origin would be sufficient
to procure their enfranchisement. The slave merchants
have therefore been under the necessity of resorting to the
neighbouring islands for a supply, and the greatest number
have been procured from <em>Báli</em> and Celebes. The total amount
may be estimated at about thirty thousand. According to the
returns obtained in 1814, it appeared that the following were
the numbers in the principal divisions of the island.</p>

<div class="center">

<p>These slaves are the property of the Europeans and Chinese
alone: the native chiefs never require the services of slaves, or
engage in the traffic of slavery. The Mahomedan laws, which
regulate their civil condition, and permit this abomination in
all its extent, are modified by the milder prejudices and more
humane temper of the country. The Dutch, who, like us,
valued themselves on their political liberty, are here the great
promoters of civil servitude, and carried with them into their
eastern empire, the Roman law regarding slavery in all its
extent and rigour. But although they adopted principles that
admitted of the most cruel and wanton treatment of slaves, I
would not be understood to say, that they carried these principles
into common practice. The contrary was almost universally
the case, and the condition of slaves on Java, where
they were employed principally in domestic offices, formed a
complete contrast to the state of those employed in the West
India plantations. It is remarked by Montesquieu, that "in
despotic countries, the condition of a slave is hardly more
burdensome than that of a subject," and such has been the
case in Java. The grounds on which the Dutch justified the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Vol I Pg 85]</a></span>
practice of making slaves, was not that they could not command
the services of the natives with a sway sufficiently absolute,
and that they were compelled to seek, beyond the
limits of the island, for unfortunate agents to perform what
the natives shewed a reluctance to undertake, but that they
found the class of foreigners more adroit and docile than the
Javans in the conduct of household affairs, and that having
reduced them to the state of property, they remained in the
family for life, and saved the trouble of a new training.</p>

<p>Upon the conquest of the island by the British in 1811, the
condition of this class of its subjects excited the attention of
government; and though we could not, consistently with those
rights of property which were admitted by the laws that we
professed to administer, emancipate them at once from servitude,
we enacted regulations, as far as we were authorized, to
ameliorate their present lot, and lead to their ultimate freedom.
Steps were immediately taken to check further importation,
and as soon as it was known that the horrid traffic in slaves
was declared a felony by the British parliament, it was not
permitted for an instant to disgrace a region to which the
British authority extended. The folly and perfect uselessness
of slavery on Java has been often pointed out by Dutch commissioners
and Dutch authors<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Vol I Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus attempted a brief description of the different
classes of the Asiatic population of the island, I shall proceed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Vol I Pg 87]</a></span>to a short detail of the habitations, dress, food, and domestic
economy of the natives; but, in order to enable the reader to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Vol I Pg 88]</a></span>understand some of the terms in the tables, and likewise in the
subsequent observations, it may not be improper simply to
state the names and titles expressive of the different gradations
of rank, leaving a more particular account of the power and
authority with which they are connected to another opportunity.
The sovereign, who is either called <em>Susuhúnan</em>, <em>Susúnan</em>,
or <em>Sultan</em>, is the fountain of honour and the source of
all distinction. His family are called <em>Pang'érans</em>, his queen
<em>Rátu</em>, the heir apparent <em>Pangéran adipáti</em>, and the prime
minister <em>Ráden adipáti</em>. Governors of provinces, called by
the Dutch <em>Regents</em>, are styled by the natives <em>Bopátis</em>, <em>Tumúngungs</em>,
or <em>Ang'abéis</em>; and are ranked among the chief
nobility of the country. All the inferior chiefs, including those
termed <em>Rádens</em>, <em>Mántris</em>, <em>Demángs</em>, <em>Lúras</em>, and others, except
the heads of villages, termed <em>Kúwus</em>, <em>Búkuls</em>, <em>Patíng'gis</em>, &amp;c.,
who are elected by the common people out of their own number
for the performance of specific duties, may be considered
as <em>petite noblesse</em>.</p>

<p>The cottage or hut of the peasant, called <em>úmah limásan</em>,
may be estimated to cost, in its first construction, from two to
four rupees, or from five to ten shillings English money. It
is invariably built on the ground, as on continental India, and
in this respect differs from similar structures in the surrounding
islands. The sleeping places, however, are generally a
little elevated above the level of the floor, and accord in simplicity
with the other parts of the dwelling. The sides or walls
are generally formed of <em>bámbus</em>, flattened and plaited together:
partitions, if any, are constructed of the same materials, and
the roof is either thatched with long grass, with the leaves of
the <em>nipa</em>, or with a kind of <em>bámbu sirap</em>. The form and size
of these cottages, as well as the materials employed in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Vol I Pg 89]</a></span>construction, vary in the different districts of the island, and
with the different circumstances of the individuals. In the
eastern districts, where the population is most dense and the
land most highly cultivated, a greater scarcity is felt of the
requisite materials than in the western, and the dwellings of
the peasantry are consequently smaller and slighter. In the
latter, the frame-work of the cottages is generally made of
timber, instead of <em>bámbus</em>, and the interior of them, as well as
the front veranda, is raised about two feet from the ground.
The accommodations consist of a room partitioned off for the
heads of the family, and an open apartment on the opposite
side for the children: there is no window either made or requisite.
The light is admitted through the door alone; nor is
this deficiency productive of any inconvenience in a climate,
where all domestic operations can be carried on in the open
air, and where shade from the sun, rather than shelter from
the weather, is required. The women perform their usual occupations
of spinning or weaving on an elevated veranda in
front, where they are protected from the rays of a vertical sun
by an extended projection of the pitch of the roof. In some
of the mountainous districts, where the rains descend with
most violence, the inhabitants provide against their effects, by
constructing their roofs of <em>bámbus</em> split into halves, and applied
to each other by their alternate concave and convex surfaces,
all along the pitch of the roof, from the top down to the
walls. On the whole, it may be affirmed that the habitations
of the peasantry of Java, even those constructed in the most
unfavourable situations and inhabited by the lowest of the
people, admit of a considerable degree of comfort and convenience,
and far exceed, in those respects, what falls to the lot
of the peasant in most parts of continental India.</p>

<p>The class of dwellings inhabited by the petty chiefs are
termed <em>úmah chébluk</em> or <em>úmah jóglo</em>. These are distinguished
by having eight slopes or roofs, four superior and four secondary.
Their value is from seven to eight dollars, or from
thirty-five to forty shillings.</p>

<p>The largest class of houses, or those in which the chiefs and
nobles reside, are termed <em>úmah túmpang</em>, and are of the same
form as the preceding; they are generally distinguished from
them by their greater size, which varies with the means and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Vol I Pg 90]</a></span>
rank of the possessor, and usually contain five or six rooms.
The supports and beams are of wood. The value of such a
habitation, calculated to answer the circumstances of an ordinary
chief of the rank of a <em>Páteh</em>, or assistant to the governor
of a province, may be about fifty or sixty dollars, or from ten
to fifteen pounds sterling.</p>

<p>In the European provinces, the size and comfort of these
dwellings have of late been very essentially contracted, by the
rigid enforcement of the monopoly of the teak forests, which
were formerly open to the natives of all classes.</p>

<p>Brick dwellings, which are sometimes, though rarely, occupied
by the natives, are termed <em>úmah gedóng</em>. This kind of
building is for the most part occupied by the Chinese, who
invariably construct a building of brick and mortar whenever
they possess the means. The Chinese <em>kámpongs</em> may always
be thus distinguished from those of the natives.</p>

<p>The cottages, which I have already described, are never
found detached or solitary: they always unite to form villages
of greater or less extent, according to the fertility of the neighbouring
plain, abundance of a stream, or other accidental circumstances.
In some provinces, the usual number of inhabitants
in a village is about two hundred, in others less than
fifty. In the first establishment or formation of a village on
new ground, the intended settlers take care to provide themselves
with sufficient garden ground round their huts for their
stock, and to supply the ordinary wants of their families. The
produce of this plantation is the exclusive property of the
peasant, and exempted from contribution or burden; and such
is their number and extent in some regencies (as in <em>Kedú</em> for
instance), that they constitute perhaps a tenth part of the area
of the whole district. The spot surrounding his simple habitation,
the cottager considers his peculiar patrimony, and cultivates
with peculiar care. He labours to plant and to rear in it
those vegetables that may be most useful to his family, and
those shrubs and trees which may at once yield him their fruit
and their shade: nor does he waste his efforts on a thankless
soil. The cottages, or the assemblage of huts, that compose
the village, become thus completely screened from the rays of
a scorching sun, and are so buried amid the foliage of a luxuriant
vegetation, that at a small distance no appearance of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Vol I Pg 91]</a></span>
human dwelling can be discovered, and the residence of a numerous
society appears only a verdant grove or a clump of ever-greens.
Nothing can exceed the beauty or the interest, which
such detached masses of verdure, scattered over the face of the
country, and indicating each the abode of a collection of
happy peasantry, add to scenery otherwise rich, whether
viewed on the sides of the mountains, in the narrow vales, or
on the extensive plains. In the last case, before the grain is
planted, and during the season of irrigation, when the rice fields
are inundated, they appear like so many small Islands, rising
out of the water. As the young plant advances, their deep rich
foliage contrasts pleasingly with its lighter tints; and when
the full-eared grain, with a luxuriance that exceeds an European
harvest, invests the earth with its richest yellow, they
give a variety to the prospect, and afford a most refreshing
relief to the eye. The clumps of trees, with which art attempts
to diversify and adorn the most skilfully arranged park, can
bear no comparison with them in rural beauty or picturesque
effect.</p>

<p>As the population increases, the extent of individual appropriations
is sometimes contracted; but when there is sufficient
untenanted ground in the neighbourhood, a new village is
thrown out at some distance, which during its infancy remains
under the charge, and on the responsibility of the parent village.
In time, however, it obtains a constitution of its own,
and in its turn becomes the parent of others. These dependent
villages are in the eastern districts termed <em>dúku</em>, and in
the western or <em>Súnda</em> districts <em>chántilan</em>.</p>

<p>Every village forms a community within itself, having each
its village officers and priest, whose habitations are as superior
to those of others as their functions are more exalted. To
complete the establishment in most large villages, a temple is
appropriated for religious worship. Here is found that simple
form of patriarchal administration, which so forcibly strikes
the imagination of the civilized inhabitants of this quarter of
the world, and which has so long been the theme of interest
and curiosity of those who have visited the Indian continent.</p>

<p>In the larger villages, or chief towns of the subdivisions, in
which the <em>Kápala chútag</em>, or division-officer, resides, a square
place, corresponding with the <em>álun álun</em> of the capital, is re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Vol I Pg 92]</a></span>served;
and, in like manner, the mosque is found to occupy
one side, and the dwelling of the chief another. The villages,
whether large or small, are fenced in by strong hedges of
<em>bámbu</em>, and other quick growing plants. All the large towns
and capitals are formed on the same principle, each hut and
dwelling being surrounded by a garden exclusively attached to
it. In this respect, they are but large villages, although usually
divided into separate jurisdictions. A newly-formed village
contains but a few families, while in the capitals the population
often amounts to several thousand souls. <em>Súra-kérta</em>, the
capital of the chief native government, though its population
is estimated to exceed one hundred thousand, may be termed
an assemblage or group of numerous villages, rather than what
in European countries would be called a town or city.</p>

<p>In the larger towns, however, and in the capitals, considerable
attention is paid to the due preservation of broad streets
or roads crossing in different directions. The inland capitals
in the <em>Súnda</em> districts are distinguished by an extreme neatness
and regularity in this respect; and although both these,
and the greater native capitals at <em>Sólo</em> and <em>Yúgy'a-kérta</em>, may
have been laid out principally at the suggestion of Europeans,
it may be observed, that the same conveniences are also to be
found in the extensive capital of <em>Banyúmas</em>, the planning of
which must be ascribed entirely to the natives.</p>

<p>The dwelling or palace of the prince is distinguished by the
terms <em>kadáton</em> or <em>kráton</em>, being contractions, the former probably
from <em>ka-datu-nan</em>, and the latter from <em>ka-ratu-nan</em>, the
place of the <em>Dátu</em> or <em>Rátu</em> (prince). Those of the Regents or
<em>Bopátis</em> (nobles entrusted with the government of provinces),
are styled <em>dálam</em>; a term which is applied to the inmost hall
or chamber of both buildings; and by which also, particularly
in the <em>Súnda</em> districts, the chiefs themselves are often distinguished.</p>

<p>The <em>kráton</em>, or palace of the prince, is an extensive square,
surrounded by a high wall, without which there is generally a
moat or ditch. In the front, and also sometimes in the rear, an
extensive open square is reserved, surrounded by a railing,
which is termed the <em>álun álun</em>. On the wall of the <em>kráton</em>,
which may be considered as the rampart of a citadel, are
usually planted cannon; and within it, the space is divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Vol I Pg 93]</a></span>
by various smaller walls, which intersect each other, and form
squares and compartments, each having a particular designation,
and answering a specific purpose; separate quarters
being assigned within the walls to all the families who may
be considered as attached to the person of the sovereign, or
that of the princes. The circumference of the wall of the
<em>kráton</em> of <em>Yúgy'a-kérta</em> is not less than three miles; and it was
estimated that, at the period of the assault in 1812, it did not
contain fewer than from ten to fifteen thousand people. That
of <em>Súra-kérta</em> is neither so extensive, nor so well built. After
crossing the <em>álun álun</em>, or square in front of the <em>kráton</em>, the
principal entrance is by a flight of steps, at the top of which it
is usual for the new sovereign to be invested with his authority,
and on which he is seated on those occasions in which he
shews himself in public. This is termed the <em>setingel</em>, from
<em>seti-ingel</em>, the high ground. On these occasions, the <em>Pang'érans</em>
and nobles are ranged below. Proceeding into the interior
of the building, and after descending a flight of steps, we
find the next principal gateway or entrance is called the <em>brójo
nólo</em>. After passing another court, the next gateway is termed
<em>kámandúngan</em>; and beyond this again is the last passage, distinguished
by the term <em>s'rimenánti</em>. Still farther on, in the
centre of a square, is the hall, <em>mendópo</em> or <em>bángsal</em>, of the
prince. On one side of the square are two small <em>mendópos</em>, or
open sheds, called <em>bángsal peng'ápit</em>, where the <em>Pang'érans</em>
assemble to wait the appearance of the sovereign in the principal
<em>mendópo</em>; and on the opposite side is the dwelling, or
<em>úmah tumpang</em>, of the prince, termed <em>próbo yókso</em>. The
<em>bángsal</em>, or <em>mendópo</em>, is a large open hall, supported by a
double row of pillars, and covered with shingles, the interior
being richly decorated with paint and gilding. The ceiling of
the <em>mendópo</em> of <em>Yúgy'a-kérta</em> is remarkable for its splendour
and richness, being composed according to that peculiar style
of architecture frequently observed throughout Java, in which
several squares, of gradually decreasing sizes, are arranged one
above and within the other; a style which is general among
the Hindus, and strongly marks the architecture of the Burmans
and Siamese.</p>

<p>In the centre of the <em>álun álun</em>, and in front of the <em>setingel</em>,
are two <em>wáringen</em> trees (the Indian fig or <em>banyan</em>), called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Vol I Pg 94]</a></span>
<em>wáring'en kúrung</em>, which have been considered as the sign or
mark of the royal residence from the earliest date of Javan
history.</p>

<p>In the dwellings of the nobles and governors of provinces,
the same form and order, with some slight modifications, are
observed. These have likewise the <em>álun álun</em> front. The
outer entrance corresponding with the <em>setíngel</em> of the <em>kráton</em>
is however with them denominated the <em>láwang sekéting</em>, the
second <em>pasádong</em>, and the third <em>régol</em>, within which is the
<em>mendópo</em>, or <em>dálam</em>. The mosque forms one side of the <em>álun
álun</em>.</p>

<p>The furniture of the houses or huts of the lower orders
is very simple, and consists of but few articles. Their bed,
as with the Sumatrans, is a fine mat with a number of pillows,
having some party-coloured cloths generally extended
over the head, in the form of a canopy or valance. They neither
use tables nor chairs, but their meals are brought on large
brass or wooden waiters, with smaller vessels of brass or china-ware
for the different articles served up. They sit cross-legged,
and, in common with other Mahomedans, only use
the right hand at their meals. They usually take up their food
between the finger and thumb, and throw it into their month.
Spoons are used only for liquids, and knives and forks very
rarely, if at all.</p>

<p>In the dwellings of the higher classes, the articles of furniture
are more numerous and expensive. Raised beds, with
many pillows piled one above the other, and mats and carpets,
are common in all; but, in the European provinces, many of the
rooms of the chiefs are furnished with looking-glasses, chairs,
tables, &amp;c. Most of these were at first introduced for the accommodation
of European visitors, but are now gradually becoming
luxuries, in which the chiefs take delight.</p>

<p>They are partial to illuminations, and, on days of festivity,
ornament the grounds adjacent to their dwellings with much
taste and design, by working the young shoots of the cocoa-nut,
the <em>bámbu</em>, and various flowers, in festoons and other contrivances.
The canopy or valance over the table, bed, or other
place selected for any particular purpose, is universal. This
canopy is generally of chintz, from Western India.</p>

<p>In all the provinces under the European government, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Vol I Pg 95]</a></span>
chiefs have several rooms fitted up in the European style, for
the accommodation of the officers of government, and none of
them hesitate to sit down at table with their visitors, and join
in the entertainment.</p>

<p>The natives of Java are in general better clothed than those
of Western India. In many provinces of the interior, and in the
elevated parts of the island, warm clothing is indispensable.
They are for the most part clothed from the produce of their
own soil and labour; but there are parts of their dress which
they willingly derive from foreign countries. Blue cloths and
chintzes, in particular, have always formed an extensive article
of importation from Western India; and the chiefs consume
considerable quantities of broadcloths, velvet, and other fabrics,
in the jackets, pantaloons, and other articles of dress, in imitation
of Europeans. Persons of condition are particular in
being what they conceive well-dressed. A sloven is an object
of ridicule; and, in point of expensive attire, they may be considered
as restricted only by their means. Although the general
character of the native costume is preserved, they seemed inclined
to adopt many of the more convenient parts of the
European dress; and, in proof of their having but few prejudices
on this score, it may be observed, that, on occasions
when the population of the country has been called out in the
Native Provinces, the assemblage of the provincials presented
themselves habited, many of them in cocked hats and stockings
of Europeans, forming a most grotesque appearance. By the
institutions of the country, a particular kind of dress is assigned
to each different rank; and there are some patterns of cloth, the
use of which is prohibited, except to the royal family: but
these sumptuary laws are for the most part obsolete in the
European provinces, and gradually becoming so in those of
the native princes, particularly since those princes have engaged
by treaty to discontinue their enforcement. There are
also distinctions of rank expressed by the different modes of
wearing the krîs, which will be treated of hereafter.</p>

<p>It is part of the domestic economy, that the women of the
family should provide the men with the cloths necessary for
their apparel, and from the first consort of the sovereign to the
wife of the lowest peasant, the same rule is observed. In
every cottage there is a spinning-wheel and loom, and in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Vol I Pg 96]</a></span>
ranks a man is accustomed to pride himself on the beauty of a
cloth woven either by his wife, mistress, or daughter.</p>

<p>The principal article of dress, common to all classes in the
Archipelago, is the cloth or <em>sárong</em>, which has been described
by Mr. Marsden to be "not unlike a Scots highlander's plaid
in appearance, being a piece of party-coloured cloth, about
six or eight feet long and three or four feet wide, sewed
together at the ends, forming, as some writers have described
it, a wide sack without a bottom." With the <em>Maláyus</em>, the
<em>sárong</em> is either worn slung over the shoulders as a sash, or
tucked round the waist and descending to the ankles, so as to
enclose the legs like a petticoat. The patterns in use among
the <em>Maláyus</em> or <em>Búgis</em> are universally Tartan; but besides
these, the Javans pride themselves in a great variety of others,
the common people only wearing the Tartan pattern, while
others prefer the Javan <em>bátek</em> or painted cloths. On occasions
of state they wear, in lieu of the <em>sárong</em> or <em>járit</em><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> (the ordinary
cloth of the country, which differs from the <em>sárong</em> in not being
united at the ends), a cloth termed <em>dódot</em>, which is made either
of cotton or silk and much larger. This is worn in the same
way; but from its size, and the manner of its being tucked up,
it falls in a kind of drapery, which is peculiar to Java.</p>

<p>The men of the lowest class generally wear a pair of coarse
short drawers, reaching towards the knee, with the <em>járit</em> or
cloth folded round the waist, and descending below the knees
like a short petticoat. This cloth is always tucked up close
round the waist, while the labourer is at work or moving
abroad, but loosened, and allowed to descend to its full length,
when in the presence of a superior. It is fastened round the
waist by a narrow waistband or belt (<em>sábuk</em>). In general, the
Javans are also provided with a jacket (<em>kalámbi</em>), having short
sleeves reaching to the elbows. This is either white, or more
frequently of light and dark blue stripes. A handkerchief
or the (<em>íkat</em>) is always folded round the head. With the <em>Maláyus</em>
this handkerchief is generally of the Tartan pattern, but
among the Javans it is of the <em>bátek</em> cloth, and put on more in the
manner of a turban than the handkerchief of a <em>Maláyu</em> is: the
crown of the head is covered with it, and the ends are tucked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Vol I Pg 97]</a></span>
in. While abroad, they generally wear over it a large hat of
leaves or of the split and plaited bambu, which shelters them
like an umbrella from the sun and rain. A coarse handkerchief
is usually tucked into the waistband, or a small bag is
suspended from it, containing tobacco, <em>síri</em>, &amp;c. The <em>kris</em> or
dagger, which is universally worn by all classes, completes
the dress. To that of the labourer, according to the work he
may be employed upon, is superadded a large knife or hatchet
for cutting wood, brushwood, or grass.</p>

<p>The women, in like manner, wear the cloth tucked round
their loins, and descending in the form of a petticoat as low as
the ankles. It is folded somewhat differently from the cloth
worn by the men, and never tucked up as with them. The
waistband or girdle by which they fasten it, is termed <em>údat</em>.
Round the body, passed above the bosom and close under the
arms, descending to the waistband, is rolled a body cloth called
<em>kémban</em>. They also commonly wear a loose gown reaching to
the knees, with long sleeves buttoning at the wrists. This
gown is almost invariably blue, never being of any variegated
pattern, and as well as the jacket of the men is usually termed
<em>kalámbi</em>. The women do not wear any handkerchief on their
head, which is ornamented by their hair fastened up in a
<em>glung</em> or knot, and by an appendage of large studs, either of
buffalo horn or brass, which they use for ear-rings. Both men
and women, even of the lowest class, wear rings on their
fingers. Those worn by the men are either of iron, brass, or
copper; those of the women of brass or copper only. The
value of a man's dress, as above described, may be estimated
at about five rupees, twelve and sixpence; and that of the women
at about six rupees, or fifteen shillings.</p>

<p>The children of the lower orders go naked, from the age of
fifteen or eighteen months to six or seven years; but the children
of persons of condition always wear the <em>járit</em> round their
loins, together with a jacket.</p>

<p>The higher orders wear a <em>járit</em>, of about seven or eight cubits
long and about three cubits wide, which with the men is folded
once round the loins, and allowed to descend to the ankles in
the form of a petticoat, but so as to admit of the leg being occasionally
exposed when set forward in the act of walking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Vol I Pg 98]</a></span>
The part which is folded in front commonly hangs somewhat
lower than the rest of the garment. The <em>sábuk</em> or waistband
is generally of silk of the <em>chíndi</em> or <em>patólé</em> pattern. When at
leisure within-doors, the men usually wear a loose cotton gown
descending as low as the knees; but when abroad, or in attendance
on public service, they for the most part wear a
jacket of broad cloth, silk, or velvet if procurable, frequently
edged with lace and ornamented with filagree buttons. This
jacket is called <em>síkapan</em> (from <em>sikap</em> ready) as it intimates,
when worn, that the party is ready for duty. The jacket used
by the Regents or chiefs of provinces, and other officers of
distinction, closely resembles the old Friesland jacket, as
worn about two centuries ago, and is probably modified, if
not entirely taken from it. Under the jacket the men always
wear a vest, usually of fine white cloth, with a single row of
filagree buttons, buttoning close to the body and at the neck
like a shirt. If the party is upon a journey or without doors
in the sun, the <em>túdang</em> or shade, which is usually of broad cloth
or velvet, is fixed over the face, having much the appearance
of a large jockey cap. The petty chiefs, particularly in the
western districts, instead of this shade wear a large hat, in the
form of a wash-hand bason reversed, made of split bambu of
various colours, and highly varnished to throw off the rain.
This is fastened by a string under the chin, in the same manner
as the hat of the common people.</p>

<p>The dress of the women of the higher classes does not in
fashion differ essentially from that of the lower orders, but the
articles are of finer texture and better quality, and gold studs
and rings, ornamented with coloured and precious stones, are
substituted for those of copper and brass. Both men and women
of condition wear sandals, shoes, or slippers in the house;
and in the European districts, the Regent and other chiefs,
when in attendance on the public officers, on journeys or
otherwise, usually superadd to the native dress tight cloth or
nankeen pantaloons, with boots and spurs, according to the
European fashion.</p>

<p>It is difficult to estimate with precision the value of the
dress of the higher orders. That of an ordinary petty chief
and his wife costs about fifty Spanish dollars, or between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Vol I Pg 99]</a></span>
twelve and thirteen pounds sterling, including the <em>siri</em> box,
which is a necessary appendage. The <em>siri</em> box of the man is
termed <em>epok</em>, that of the woman <em>chepúri</em>.</p>

<p>Neither men nor women cut their hair, but allow it to grow
to its natural length: in this they differ from the <em>Maláyus</em> and
<em>Búgis</em>, who always wear it short. The men, except on particular
occasions, gather it up on the crown of the head, twist
it round, and fasten it by means of a semicircular tortoise-shell
comb fixed in front; but among the higher classes, it is considered
a mark of the greatest respect to let it flow in curls in
the presence of a superior. The princes and chiefs at the native
courts usually confine it on the neck, and allow it to descend
down the back in large curls; but in <em>Chéribon</em> and the
<em>Súnda</em> districts, the chiefs, on occasions of ceremony, let their
locks flow in curls and ringlets loose over their shoulders. The
women confine their hair by gathering and twisting it into one
large <em>glúng</em> or knot at the back of the head, in the manner of
performing which there are several modes, distinguished by as
many names. The short down encircling the forehead is
sometimes cut or shaved, to give the brow a better defined
appearance, when the hair is combed back, and on particular
occasions the fine hair in the same place, which is too short to
be combed back and gathered in the knot, is turned in small
curls like a fringe. All classes, both of men and women, apply
oils to their hair. The women frequently use scents in dressing
it, and on state days ornament it with a great variety of
flowers, diamond-headed pins, and other jewellery. Both sexes
perfume their persons with different species of fragrant oils, as
the <em>láng'a chandána</em> (sandal-wood oil), <em>láng'a kanáng'a</em>,
<em>láng'a gáru</em>, <em>láng'a gandapúra</em>, and <em>láng'a jerú</em>, and adorn
the skin with a variety of powders called <em>bóré</em>; as the <em>bóré
kúning</em> (yellow powder), <em>bóré érang</em> (black), <em>boré sárí</em>, and
<em>boré k'lambak</em>. To these may be added the general use of
musk, termed by them <em>dédes</em>. In the houses of the higher
orders, <em>dúpa</em> or incense of benjamin, and other odoriferous
gums, is generally burnt.</p>

<p>The priests generally dress in white, and imitate the turbans
of the Arabs.</p>

<p>Such is the ordinary costume of the bulk of the population,
as it is usually seen in all that part of the island peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Vol I Pg 100]</a></span>
called Java. In the western or <em>Súnda</em> districts, the common
people are by no means so well supplied with articles of dress
as in the eastern. They are often seen with little or no covering,
beyond a piece of very coarse cloth tied round the waist.
The Regents or chiefs of provinces in these districts generally
wear, when on public duty with the officers of the European
government, a velvet cap ornamented with gold lace, differing
in fashion in each province, but usually calculated to
shade the face from the direct rays of the sun. In the eastern
districts the chiefs, on similar occasions, wear the cap called
<em>kúluk</em>, which will be more particularly mentioned as part of
the court dress.</p>

<p>Besides what may be thus termed the ordinary dress, two
grand distinctions are noticed in the costume of the Javans:
these are the war dress and the court dress. The former consists
of <em>chelána</em> or pantaloons, buttoned from the hip down to
the ankles; the <em>kátok</em>, short kilt or petticoat of coloured silk
or fine cotton, descending just below the knee; and the <em>ámben</em>
or girth, rolled tightly round the body seven or eight times,
like a military sash, and securing the whole body from below
the arms to the hips: this is made either of silk or very fine
cotton. Over this is drawn a tight vest without buttons,
termed <em>sángsang</em>, and over this again the ordinary vest or
<em>kótan</em> with buttons, buttoning close round the body and neck,
the <em>síkapan</em> or jacket being worn over the whole. The <em>túdung</em>,
or shade for the face, is usually worn on this occasion, as well
as shoes or sandals. The <em>ang'ger</em> or sword belt, which goes
round the waist, also forms an essential part of the war dress,
in which the <em>pedáng</em> or sword is suspended on the left side.
Three <em>kríses</em> are usually worn in the waist on these occasions,
one on each side and the other behind. These consist of the
<em>krís</em> which the wearer particularly calls his own, the <em>krís</em> which
has descended to him from his ancestors, and the <em>krís</em> which
he may have received on his marriage from his wife's father.
The latter is often placed on the left side for immediate use.
This dress is worn in going into the field of battle, on which
occasion it is the custom to appear in the richest attire their
means admit, and to wear the rings and the other valuable
jewels or trinkets which they possess.</p>

<p>In the court or full dress, the shoulders, arms, and body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Vol I Pg 101]</a></span>
down to the waist, are entirely bare; the drapery descending
from the loins downwards, <em>chelána</em>, and what may be worn on
the head, being the only covering. When a subject, whatever
be his rank or family, approaches his prince, he must wear
<em>chelána</em> or pantaloons of coloured silk or of fine cotton, without
buttons; and instead of the <em>járit</em> or ordinary cloth, he
must wear the <em>dódot</em>, a cloth which is of nearly double the
dimensions. This is put on, however, nearly in the same
manner as the <em>járit</em>, but so as not to descend on the right
side further than just below the knee, while on the left it falls
in a rich drapery, until it touches the ground in a point. The
<em>sábuk</em> or waistband must be of gold lace, the fringed ends of
which usually hang down a few inches, and the party must
only wear one <em>krís</em>, which is tucked in the waistband on the
right side behind, while on the left he wears a weapon, or
rather implement, called a <em>wédung</em>, in the shape of a chopper,
together with a small knife, indicative of his readiness to cut
down trees and grass at the order of his sovereign. On his
head he must wear a peculiar kind of cap (<em>kuluk</em>), said to have
been introduced by the Sultan <em>Pájang</em> in imitation of the scull-cap
of the Arabs; it is made of cloth, and either white or light
blue, stiffened with rich starch: on more ordinary occasions,
and generally, except in full dress, the chiefs prefer a cap of
the same form made of black velvet, ornamented with gold,
and sometimes a diamond on the crown. The part of the body
which is left uncovered is generally rubbed over with white
or yellow powder. The sovereign himself is usually habited
in the same manner on state occasions, his body and arms
being covered with a bright yellow powder. When women
approach the sovereign, besides having their hair ornamented
with diamonds and flowers, they must wear a <em>sémbong</em> or sash
round the waist, which generally is of yellow silk with red at
the two ends. It is brought once round the body from behind,
and the long ends are allowed to descend towards the ground,
one over each hip.</p>

<p>Since the loss of the <em>makóta</em>, or golden crown of <em>Majapáhit</em>,
which disappeared on the banishment of <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat</em>,
both the <em>Susúnan</em> and <em>Sultan</em>, on public occasions, when
they have to meet the European authorities, wear a velvet hat
or cap of a particular fashion, somewhat different at each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Vol I Pg 102]</a></span>
court; that of the <em>Susúnan</em> resembling what is distinguished
by the term of the Madúra hat in consequence of its being still
worn by the Madúra family, and that of the Sultan having a
golden <em>garúda</em> affixed at the back, and two wings of gold extending
from behind the ears. They both wear breeches,
stockings, and buckles, after the European fashion.</p>

<p>The <em>jámang</em> or golden plate, which was worn over the forehead,
as well as a variety of golden ornaments round the neck
and arms, and which formerly formed the most splendid part
of the costume, are now disused; except at marriages, or in
dramatic or other entertainments, when the ancient costume of
the country is exhibited in all its rich and gorgeous variety.</p>

<p>The following picture of a Javan beauty, taken from one of
the most popular poems of the country, will serve better than
any description of mine, to place before the reader the standard
of female elegance and perfection in the island, and to convey
an accurate idea of the personal decorations on nuptial occasions,
in dances and dramatic exhibitions; it will at the same
time afford a representation of what may be considered to have
formed the full dress of a female of distinction, before the innovations
of Mahometanism and the partial introduction of the
European fashions. The extravagant genius of eastern poetry
may perhaps be best employed in portraying such fantastic
images, or celebrating such extraordinary tastes.</p>

<p>"Her face was fair and bright as the moon, and it expressed
all that was lovely. The beauty of <em>Ráden Pútri</em> far excelled
even that of the <em>widadári Déwi Ráti</em>: she shone bright
even in the dark, and she was without defect or blemish.</p>

<p>"So clear and striking was her brightness, that it flashed to
the sky as she was gazed at: the lustre of the sun was even
dimmed in her presence, for she seemed to have stolen from
him his refulgence. So much did she excel in beauty, that
it is impossible to describe it.</p>

<p>"Her shape and form were nothing wanting, and her hair
when loosened hung down to her feet, waving in dark curls:
the short front hairs were turned with regularity as a fringe,
her forehead resembling the <em>chendána</em> stone. Her eyebrows
were like two leaves of the <em>ímbo</em> tree; the outer angle of the
eye acute and slightly extended; the ball of the eye full, and
the upper eyelash slightly curling upwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Vol I Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tears seemed floating in her eye, but started not. Her
nose was sharp and pointed; her teeth black as the <em>kómbang</em>;
her lips the colour of the newly cut <em>mangústin</em> shell.
Her teeth regular and brilliant; her cheeks in shape like the
fruit of the <em>dúren</em>; the lower part of the cheek slightly protruding.
Her ears in beauty like the <em>giánti</em> flowers, and her
neck like unto the young and graceful <em>gádung</em> leaf.</p>

<p>"Her shoulders even, like the balance of golden scales; her
chest open and full; her breasts like ivory, perfectly round
and inclining to each other. Her arms ductile as a bow; her
fingers long and pliant, and tapering like thorns of the
forest. Her nails like pearls; her skin bright yellow; her
waist formed like the <em>pátram</em> when drawn from its sheath;
her hips as the reversed <em>límas</em> leaf.</p>

<p>"Like unto the <em>púdak</em> flower when hanging down its head,
was the shape of her leg; her foot flat with the ground; her
gait gentle and majestic like that of the elephant. Thus
beautiful in person, she was clothed with a <em>chíndi patóla</em> of
a green colour, fastened round the waist with a golden <em>lúlut</em>
or cestus: her outer garment being of the <em>méga mendúng
(dark clouded)</em> pattern. Her <em>kémban (upper garment)</em>
was of the pattern <em>jing'gomosi</em>, edged with lace of gold; on
her finger she wore a ring, the production of the sea, and her
ear-rings were of the pattern <em>nóto bróngto</em>.</p>

<p>"On the front of the ear-studs were displayed the beauties
of the <em>segára múnchar</em> pattern (<em>emeralds encircled by rubies
and diamonds</em>), and she bound up her hair in the first
fashion, fastening it with the <em>glúng (knot) bobokóran</em>, and
decorating it with the green <em>chámpaca</em> flower, and also with
the <em>gámbir, meláti</em>, and <em>mínor</em> flowers; and in the centre
of it she fixed a golden pin, with a red jewel on the top, and
a golden flower ornamented with emeralds. Her necklace
was composed of seven kinds of precious stones, and most
brilliant to behold; and she was highly perfumed, without
it being possible to discover from whence the scent was
produced.</p>

<p>"Her <em>jámang (tiara or head ornament)</em> was of the fashion
<em>sódo sáler</em> and richly chased; her bracelets were of the
pattern <em>glang-kána</em>, and suited the <em>jámang</em>. Thus was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Vol I Pg 104]</a></span>
beauty of her person heightened and adorned by the splendour
of her dress."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To this we may add, from one of the popular versions of the
work called <em>Jáya Langkárá</em> the notions which the Javans
have of the virtues, beauties, and dress, that should adorn a
young man of family.</p>

<p>"In a youth of noble birth there are seven points which
should strike the observer, and these are indispensable. In
the first place, he should be of good descent; in the second,
he should possess understanding; in the third, he should
know how to conduct himself. In the fourth place, he
recollects what he learns in the <em>sástras</em>; in the fifth, his
views must be enlarged; in the sixth, he must be religious;
in the seventh, he must exert the qualifications he possesses
unhesitatingly. These are the seven points which must
strike the immediate attention of the observer.</p>

<p>"In his heart and mind he must be quiet and tranquil. He
should be able to repress his inclinations, and to be silent
when necessary: never should he on any account tell a
falsehood. He should not think long concerning property,
neither should he fear death: in his devotions he should be
free from pride, and he should relieve the distressed.</p>

<p>"It should be observed by all, that whatever he undertakes
is quickly executed. He should quietly penetrate other
men's thoughts and intentions; his inquiries should be discreet,
intelligent, and active. Whenever he meets with an
able man, he should attach himself to him as a friend, and
never leave him till he has drawn all his knowledge from
him; and in whatever he does, his actions should be rather
what is generally approved, than the result of his mere will.</p>

<p>"As long as he lives he must continue to thirst after more
knowledge; and he must constantly guard his own conduct,
that men may not say it is bad. His recollection should be
clear and distinct, his speech mild and gentle; so that people's
hearts may be softened, and possessing these qualifications
his dependants may praise him.</p>

<p>"His appearance and stature should not be deficient. The
light of his countenance should be sweet, like that of <em>Batára<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Vol I Pg 105]</a></span>
Asmára (the god of love)</em> when he descends to the earth.
When men look upon him, they should be struck with the
idea, 'how great would he not be in war!' In the form of
his body no part should be ill shaped. His skin should be
like unto virgin gold before it has undergone the process of
fire; his head rather large; his hair straight and long. His
eyes watery and ready to overflow; his brows like the <em>ímbo</em>
leaf; his eyelash like the <em>tánjung</em> flower; his nose sharp
and prominent, with but little hair above the upper lip; his
lips like the newly cut <em>mangústin</em> shell; his teeth as if
painted, shining and black like the <em>kómbang</em>; his breast and
shoulders wide.</p>

<p>"A bright circle should irradiate his face and breast, and
he should stand unrivalled. Whatever he says should make
an impression on all who hear him, and his speech should be
playful and agreeable.</p>

<p>"He should wear the <em>chelána chíndi</em>, with a dark green
<em>dódot</em> of the pattern <em>gádong-eng'úkup</em>; his sash of golden
lace. His <em>krís</em> should have the sheath of the <em>sátrían</em> fashion,
and the handle should be that of <em>túng'gáksmi</em>. The <em>súmping
(an imitation of flowers or leaves which hang over the
ear)</em> should be of gold, and of the fashion <em>súreng páti (brave
to death)</em>; and on his right thumb (<em>palgúna</em>) he should at
the same time wear a golden ring."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In common with the Sumatrans, and other inhabitants of
the Archipelago and southern part of the peninsula, both sexes
of all ranks have the custom of filing and blackening the teeth,
it being considered as disgraceful to allow them to remain
"white like a dog's." The operation is performed when the
children are about eight or nine years of age, and is a very
painful one. The object is to make the front teeth concave,
and by filing away the enamel, to render them better adapted
for receiving the black dye. This extraordinary and barbarous
custom tends to destroy the teeth at an early age, and
with the use of tobacco, <em>síri</em>, and lime, which are continually
chewed, generally greatly disfigures the mouth. The Javans,
however, do not file away the teeth so much as is usual with
some of the other islanders; nor do they set them in gold, as
is the case with the Sumatrans. Neither do they distend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Vol I Pg 106]</a></span>
lobe of the ear, to that enormous extent practised on <em>Báli</em> and
elsewhere, and which is observed in the representations of
<em>Búdh</em>. This has been discontinued since the introduction of
Mahomedanism.</p>

<p>Compared with the western Asiatics, the Javans have but
few prejudices regarding food. They are Mahomedans, and
consequently abstain rigidly from swine's flesh, and commonly
from inebriating liquors; and some few families, from the remains
of a superstition which has descended to them from
their Hindu ancestors, will not eat of the flesh of the bull or
cow; but with these exceptions, there are few articles which
come amiss to them. They live principally upon vegetable
food, and rice is on Java, what it is throughout Asia, the chief
article of subsistence; but fish, flesh, and fowl are likewise
daily served up at their meals, according to the circumstances
of the parties. With fish they are abundantly supplied; and
what cannot be consumed while fresh, is salted, or dried, and
conveyed into the inland provinces. They do not eat of the
turtle or other amphibious animals, but none of the fish
known to Europeans are objected to by them. The flesh of
the buffalo, the ox, the deer, the goat, and various kinds of
poultry, are daily exposed for sale in their markets, and are of
very general consumption. The flesh of the horse is also
highly esteemed by the common people; but the killing of
horses for food is generally prohibited, except when maimed
or diseased. The hide of the buffalo is cut into slices, soaked,
and fried as a favourite dish. The flesh of the deer, dried and
smoked, is well known throughout the Malayan Archipelago,
under the term <em>dinding</em>, and is an article in high request on
Java.</p>

<p>The dairy forms no part of domestic economy of Java, neither
milk itself, nor any preparation from it, being prized or used
by the natives: a circumstance very remarkable, considering
that they were undoubtedly Hindus at one period of their history;
and that, if so essential an article of food had once been
introduced, it is probable it would always have been cherished.
No good reason seems to be assigned for their indifference to
milk; except perhaps the essential one, that the cows of Java
afford but a very scanty supply of that secretion. The udder
of a Javan cow is sometimes not larger than that of a sheep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Vol I Pg 107]</a></span>
and seems to afford but a bare subsistence for the calf; yet the
buffalo gives a larger quantity, and butter or <em>ghee</em> might equally
be prepared from it. The cows of the Indian breed are distinguished
by a hump between the shoulders and a larger
udder; and it has been found that the secretion of milk can
be increased, as it is observed that where particular care has
been taken by Europeans even of the Javan cows, they have in
a short time afforded double the usual quantity. It has been
conjectured, that on the introduction of the Indian breed by
the Hindu colonists, the use of milk was forbidden, in order
that the number of cattle might more rapidly increase; but
the Javans have no tradition to this effect. It is however remarkable,
that an absolute aversion to this aliment exists on
that part of the continent of Asia, in which many popular
usages are found similar to those of the east insular nations.
In a recent publication it is stated of the people between Siam
and China, who are not, by the bye, very nice in what they eat,
"qu'ils ne se permettent pas le lait des animaux, et qu'ils ont
pour cette boisson la répugnance que peut inspirer la boisson
du sang. Cette répugnance va même jusqu'à exclure du
nombre de ses alimens le beurre et le fromage<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>."</p>

<p>Salt is obtained in abundance throughout every part of the
island, but being manufactured on the coast, is proportionally
higher in price in the inland districts. The sugar used by the
natives is not prepared from the sugar-cane, but from the áren
and other palms. It is manufactured by the simple process
of boiling down the <em>tári</em>, or liquor which exudes from these
trees, which are tapped for the purpose.</p>

<p>None of the palms of Java furnish the worms which are
employed for food in other eastern countries, but similar
worms are found in various kinds of <em>rótan</em>, <em>sólak</em>, &amp;c. which
are considered as dainties, not only by the natives, but by the
Chinese and by some Europeans: they are called <em>géndon</em>.
Worms of various species, but all equally esteemed as articles
of food, are found in the teak and other trees. White ants, in
their different states, are one of the most common articles of
food in particular districts: they are collected in different
ways, and sold generally in the public markets. Their extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Vol I Pg 108]</a></span>
nests are opened to take out the chrysalis; or they are
watched, and swarms of the perfect insect are conducted into
basins or trays containing a little water, where they soon
perish: they are called <em>láron</em>.</p>

<p>The cooking utensils are, as might be supposed, of the most
simple kind, and either of coarse pottery or copper. Rice,
after several poundings in a trough or mortar, is generally
dressed by steam, though not unfrequently boiled in a small
quantity of water. In the former case, it is remarkable for its
whiteness and consistency when dressed; and in this state it
is publicly exposed for sale in the markets and along the high
roads. Indian corn is usually roasted in the ear, and offered
for sale in the same manner. Other aliments are for the most
part prepared in the manner of curry, termed by the <em>Maláyus
gulai</em>: of these they have almost an endless variety, distinguished
according to the principal ingredients. Besides
what may be considered as the principal dishes, they excel in
a variety of preparations of pastry and sweetmeats (particularly
of the <em>kétan</em>), of which many are by no means unpleasant to
an European palate. They are fond of colouring their pastry,
as well as other articles of their food. They occasionally
make their rice yellow and brown, and even turn their boiled
eggs red for variety.</p>

<p>Black pepper, as among the <em>Maláyus</em>, is scarcely ever used,
on account of its supposed heating quality. The most
common seasoning employed to give a relish to their insipid
food, is the <em>lombok</em>; triturated with salt, it is called <em>sámbel</em>,
both by the <em>Maláyus</em> and Javans, and this condiment is indispensable
and universal. It is of different kinds, according to
the substances added to increase or diversify its strength or
pungency; the most common addition is <em>trási</em>, denominated
by the <em>Maláyus, bláchang</em>. The name <em>lálab</em> is given to
various leaves and kernels, mostly eaten raw with rice and
<em>sámbel</em>: many of these substances possess a pungency and
odour intolerable to Europeans. If several vegetables are
mixed together, and prepared by boiling, they constitute what
is called <em>jang'an</em>, or greens for the table, of which there are
several distinctions. The various legumes are of great importance
in the diet of the natives. <em>Padomóro</em>, <em>pin'dang</em>, and
<em>semúr</em>, are dishes to which the flesh of the buffalo or fowls is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Vol I Pg 109]</a></span>
added, and which resemble the Indian curry. <em>Rújak</em> is prepared
from unripe mangos and other fruits, which, being
grated, receive the addition of capsicum and other spices, and
thus constitutes a favourite dish with the natives, though very
disagreeable to Europeans.</p>

<p>The Chinese prepare from the <em>gédelé</em> a species of soy, somewhat
inferior to that brought from Japan. The <em>káchang-iju</em>
is highly useful as a general article of diet, and is a good
substitute for various legumes, which form the common
nourishment of the continental Indians: it contains much
farinaceous matter. <em>Trási</em> or <em>bláchang</em> is prepared in many
situations along the northern coast, but is mostly required for
the consumption of the interior. It is prepared from prawns
or shrimps, and extensive fisheries for the purpose are established
in many parts of the coast. The shrimps being taken,
are strewed with salt, and exposed to the sun till dry; they
are then pounded in wooden mortars, dressed, and formed into
masses resembling large cheeses: in this state they constitute
an article of trade, and are distributed through the country.
The putrescent fluid remaining after the expression strongly
impregnated with the odour of the shrimps, is evaporated
to the consistence of a jelly, and affords a favourite sauce
called <em>pétis</em>. An inferior kind of <em>trási</em> is prepared from small
fish, and, when made into the form of small balls, is called
<em>blények. Trási blúro</em> is of a reddish colour, and much
esteemed at the native capitals. Another kind of <em>pétis</em> is
prepared from the flesh of the buffalo, chiefly in the interior
districts.</p>

<p>Salted eggs are also an important article in the diet of the
Javans. The eggs of ducks being most abundant, are chiefly
preserved in this way. The eggs are enveloped in a thick
covering made of a mixture of salt and ashes in equal parts,
or salt and pounded bricks, and being wrapped each in
a large leaf, they are placed on one another in a tub, or large
earthen vessel. In ten days they are fit for use; but they
are generally kept longer in the mixture, and, being thoroughly
impregnated with salt, can be kept many months. In some
districts, the eggs of the Muscovy duck are particularly
employed for the purpose.</p>

<p>In preparing their food, the Javans may be considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Vol I Pg 110]</a></span>
to observe the same degree of cleanliness which is usual with
Asiatics in general; and in point of indulgence of appetite,
they may be, perhaps, placed about midway between the
abstemious Hindu and the unscrupulous Chinese. In a
country where vegetation is luxuriant, and cultivation is
already considerably advanced, it follows that there must
be an abundant supply for a people who subsist principally on
vegetable productions; and it may be asserted, that, except
where the manifest oppressions of government, or the effects
of civil discord, for the moment deprive the labourer of his
just reward, there are few countries where the mass of the
population are so well fed as on Java. There are few of the
natives who cannot obtain their <em>káti</em>, or pound and a quarter
of rice a day, with fish, greens, and salt, if not other articles,
to season their meal. Where rice is less abundant, its place
is supplied by maize or Indian corn, or the variety of beans
which are cultivated; and even should a family be driven
into the woods, they would still be able to obtain a bare subsistence
from the numerous nutritious roots, shoots, and leaves,
with which the forests abound. Famine is unknown; and
although partial failures of the crop may occur, they are
seldom so extensive as to be generally felt by the whole community.
Thus abundantly supplied, the Javans seem by no
means inclined to reject the bounties of Providence: they are
always willing to partake of a hearty meal, and seldom have
occasion to make a scanty one. Yet among them a glutton is
a term of reproach, and to be notoriously fond of good living
is sufficient to attach this epithet to any one.</p>

<p>The Javans, except where respect to Europeans dictates a
different practice, eat their meals off the ground. A mat kept for
the purpose is laid on the floor, which, when the meal is over,
is again carefully rolled up, with the same regularity as the
table-cloth in Europe; and a plate of rice being served up to
each person present, the whole family or party sit down to partake
of the meal in a social manner. A principal dish, containing
the <em>sámbel</em>, <em>jángan</em>, or other more highly seasoned
preparation, is then handed round, or placed in the centre of
the company, from which each person adds what he thinks
proper to the allowance of rice before him.</p>

<p>Water is the principal and almost exclusive beverage, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Vol I Pg 111]</a></span>
among people of condition, it is invariably boiled first, and
generally drunk warm. Some are in the habit of flavouring
the water with cinnamon and other spices; but tea, when it
can be procured, is drunk by all classes at intervals during
the day.</p>

<p>On occasions of festivals and parties, when many of the chiefs
are assembled, the dishes are extremely numerous and crowded;
and hospitality being a virtue which the Javans carry almost
to an excess, due care is taken that the dependants and retainers
are also duly provided for. These, particularly in the
highlands of the <em>Súnda</em> districts, where the people are furthest
removed from foreign intercourse, and the native manners are
consequently better preserved, are arranged in rows at intervals,
according to their respective ranks; the first in order
sitting at the bottom of the hall, and the lowest at some distance
without, where each is carefully supplied with a bountiful
proportion of the feast: thus exhibiting, in the mountainous
districts of Java, an example of rude hospitality, and union of
the different gradations of society in the same company, similar
to that which prevailed in the Highlands of Scotland some
centuries ago, where, it is said, "those of inferior description
were, nevertheless, considered as guests, and had their share,
both of the entertainment and of the good cheer of the day."</p>

<p>It is at these parties that the chiefs sometimes indulge in
intoxicating liquors, but the practice is not general; and the
use of wine, which has been introduced among them by the
Dutch, is in most instances rather resorted to from respect to
Europeans, than from any attachment to the bottle.</p>

<p>The Javans have universally two meals in the day; one
just before noon, and one between seven and eight o'clock in
the evening: the former, which is the principal meal, corresponding
with the European dinner, and distinguished by the
term <em>mángán-áwan</em>, or the day meal; the latter, termed
<em>mángán wéngé</em>, or evening meal. They have no regular meal
corresponding with the European breakfast; but those who
go abroad early in the morning, usually partake of a basin of
coffee and some rice cakes before they quit their homes, or
purchase something of the kind at one of the numerous <em>wárongs</em>,
or stalls, which line the public roads, and are to the
common people as so many coffee or eating-houses would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Vol I Pg 112]</a></span>
to the European; rice, coffee, cakes, boiled rice, soups, ready
dressed meats and vegetables, being at all times exposed in
them. What is thus taken by the Javans in the morning to
break the fast, is considered as a whet, and termed sarap.</p>

<p>By the custom of the country, good food and lodging are
ordered to be provided for all strangers and travellers arriving
at a village; and in no country are the rights of hospitality
more strictly enjoined by institutions, or more conscientiously
and religiously observed by custom and practice. "It is not
sufficient," say the Javan institutions, "that a man should
place good food before his guest; he is bound to do more:
he should render the meal palatable by kind words and
treatment, to soothe him after his journey, and to make his
heart glad while he partakes of the refreshment." This is
called <em>bójo krómo</em>, or real hospitality.</p>

<p>The chewing of betel-leaf (<em>síri</em>), and the areka-nut (<em>pínang</em>),
as well as of tobacco (<em>tambáko</em>), and <em>gámbir</em>, is common to
all classes. The <em>síri</em> and <em>pínang</em> are used much in the same
manner as by the natives of India in general. These stimulants
are considered nearly as essential to their comfort, as
salt is among Europeans. The commonest labourer contrives
to procure at least tobacco, and generally <em>síri</em>; and if he cannot
afford a <em>síri</em> box, a small supply will be usually found in
the corner of his handkerchief. Cardamums and cloves compose
part of the articles in the síri box of a person of condition.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Java, as a nation, must be accounted
sober; although Europeans, in order to serve their own purposes,
by inducing some of the chiefs to drink wine to excess,
have succeeded, to a certain extent, in corrupting the habits of
some individuals in this respect. Two kinds of fermented
liquor are however prepared by the Javans, called <em>bádek</em> and
<em>bróm</em>: the former from rice; the latter almost exclusively
from <em>kétan</em> or glutinous rice. In making <em>bádek</em>, the rice previously
boiled is stewed with a ferment called <em>rági</em>, consisting
of onions, black pepper, and capsicum, and mixed up into
small cakes, which are daily sold in the markets. After frequent
stirring, the mixture is rolled into balls, which are piled
upon each other in a high earthen vessel, and when fermentation
has commenced the <em>bádek</em> exudes and is collected at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Vol I Pg 113]</a></span>
bottom. The remaining rice, strongly impregnated with the
odour of fermentation, has a sweetish taste, and is daily offered
for sale in the markets as a dainty, under the name of <em>tapé</em>.
<em>Bádek</em> is, in comparison with <em>bróm</em>, a simple liquor, producing
only slight intoxication: it is often administered to children
to dislodge worms from the intestines. In making <em>bróm</em>,
the <em>kétan</em> is boiled in large quantities, and being stewed with
<em>rági</em>, remains exposed in open tubs till fermentation takes
place, when the liquor is poured off into close earthen vessels.
It is generally buried in the earth for several months, by which
the process of fermentation is checked and the strength of the
liquor increased: sometimes it is concentrated by boiling.
The colour is brown, red, or yellow, according to the kind of
<em>kétan</em> employed. <em>Bróm</em>, which has been preserved for several
years, is highly esteemed among the natives, constituting a
powerful spirit, which causes violent intoxication followed by
severe head-ache in persons not accustomed to its use. The
substance that remains after separation is a deadly poison to
fowls, dogs, and various other animals. Arrack is prepared by
distillation: an inferior kind, made in a more simple and economical
manner, is called <em>chiu</em>. Both are prepared by the
Chinese, and a particular account of the method employed will
be found under another head<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>. A kind of small beer is made
at <em>Súra-kérta</em> in a mode similar to the European process of
brewing, by exciting fermentation in a solution of Javan sugar,
with several spices and the leaves of the <em>pári</em> instead of hops.
When fresh, the liquor is sprightly, and not unpleasant to
the taste; but it cannot be preserved longer than four or
five days.</p>

<p>The use of opium, it must be confessed and lamented, has
struck deep into the habits, and extended its malignant influence
to the morals of the people, and is likely to perpetuate
its power in degrading their character and enervating their
energies, as long as the European government, overlooking
every consideration of policy and humanity, shall allow a paltry
addition to their finances to outweigh all regard to the ultimate
happiness and prosperity of the country. It is either eaten in
its crude state as <em>mánta</em>, or smoked as <em>mádat</em> or <em>chándu</em>. In
the preparation of <em>mádat</em>, the crude opium is boiled down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Vol I Pg 114]</a></span>
with the leaves of tobacco, <em>síri</em>, or the like, and used in a sticky
or somewhat liquid state. In <em>chándu</em>, the opium is merely
boiled down without any admixture, to a still thicker consistency,
and rolled into small balls or pills, in which state, when
dry, they are inserted into <em>bámbus</em>, and thus smoked. The
crude opium is eaten principally by the people in the interior
of the country, in the provinces of the native princes: the
opium prepared for smoking is used along the coast, and generally
in the other islands of the Archipelago; it is prepared
by the Chinese. The use of opium, however, though carried
to a considerable extent, is still reckoned disgraceful, and persons
addicted to it are looked upon as abandoned characters,
and despised accordingly. The effects of this poison on the
human frame are so well described by the Dutch commissioners
who sat at the Hague in 1803, and who much to their
honour declared, "that no consideration of pecuniary advantage
ought to weigh with the European government in allowing
its use," that together with the opinion of Mr. Hogendorp,
who concurred with them, I shall insert their statement here.
The wish to do justice to authorities, whose views were so
creditable to their country and their own character, and the
importance of their opinion to an extensive population, will
plead an apology for the length of the extract which I now
present.</p>

<p>"The opium trade," observe the Commissioners, "requires
likewise attention. The English in Bengal have assumed an
exclusive right to collect the same, and they dispose of a
considerable number of chests containing that article annually
at Calcutta by public auction. It is much in demand
on the Malay coast, at Sumatra, Java, and all the islands
towards the east and north, and particularly in China,
although the use thereof is confined to the lower classes.
The effect which it produces on the constitution is different,
and depends on the quantity that is taken, or on other circumstances.
If used with moderation, it causes a pleasant,
yet always somewhat intoxicating sensation, which absorbs
all care and anxiety. If a large quantity is taken, it produces
a kind of madness, of which the effects are dreadful,
especially when the mind is troubled by jealousy, or inflamed
with a desire of vengeance or other violent passions.
At all times it leaves a slow poison, which undermines the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Vol I Pg 115]</a></span>
faculty of the soul and the constitution of the body, and
renders a person unfit for all kind of labour and an image
of the brute creation. The use of opium is so much more
dangerous, because a person who is once addicted to it can
never leave it off. To satisfy that inclination, he will sacrifice
every thing, his own welfare, the subsistence of his
wife and children, and neglect his work. Poverty is the
natural consequence, and then it becomes indifferent to him
by what means he may content his insatiable desire after
opium; so that, at last, he no longer respects either the
property or life of his fellow-creature.</p>

<p>"If here we were to follow the dictates of our own heart
only, and what moral doctrine and humanity prescribe, no
law, however severe, could be contrived, which we would
not propose, to prevent at least that in future, no subjects
of this Republic, or of the Asiatic possessions of the state,
should be disgraced by trading in that abominable poison.
Yet we consider this as absolutely impracticable at present
with respect to those places not subject to the state. Opium
is one of the most profitable articles of eastern commerce:
as such it is considered by our merchants; and if the navigation
to those parts is opened to them (which the interest
of the state forcibly urges), it is impossible to oppose trading
in the same. In this situation of affairs, therefore, we are
rather to advise, that general leave be given to import opium
at Malacca, and to allow the exportation from thence to
Borneo and all the eastern parts <em>not</em> in the possession of
the state."</p>

<p>"Opium," says Mr. Hogendorp, "is a slow though certain
poison, which the Company, in order to gain money, sells
to the poor Javans. Any one who is once enslaved to it,
cannot, it is true, give it up without great difficulty; and if
its use were entirely prohibited, some few persons would
probably die for want of it, who would otherwise languish
on a little longer: but how many would by that means be
saved for the future. Most of the crimes, particularly murders,
that are now committed, may be imputed to opium as
the original cause.</p>

<p>"Large sums of money are every year carried out of the
country in exchange for it, and enrich our competitors, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Vol I Pg 116]</a></span>
English. Much of it is smuggled into the interior, which
adds to the evil. In short, the trade in opium is one of the
most injurious and most shameful things which disgrace the
present government of India. It is therefore necessary at
once, and entirely, to abolish the trade and importation of
opium, and to prohibit the same, under the severest penalties
that the law permits, since it is a poison. The
smuggling of it will then become almost impracticable, and
the health, and even the lives of thousands, will be preserved.
The money alone which will remain in the country
in lieu of it, is more valuable as being in circulation, than
the profit which the Company now derives from the sale
of it.</p>

<p>"This measure will excite no discontent among the Javans,
for the princes and regents, with very few exceptions, do
not consume any opium, but, as well as the most respectable
of their subjects, look upon it as disgraceful. The use of
opium is even adduced as an accusation of bad conduct,
and considered as sufficient cause for the removal or banishment
of a petty chief."</p>

of chácha, or "families," as it is usually rendered, though the word strictly
means "enumeration." When the sovereign assigns lands, it is not usual
for him to express the extent of land, but the number of chácha attached
to it. But as the population of the land so granted varies, the original
expression becomes inaccurate. In the native provinces, the number of
cháchas reckoned is almost invariably less than the number actually existing,
a clear proof, if the original census was correct, that in those provinces
population has increased. An account of the number of cháchas
was taken some few years back by the Sultan of Yúgya-kérta, with a view
to a new distribution of the lands; but the measure was very unpopular,
and no accurate results were obtained. The Dutch relied entirely upon
this loose system of enumeration.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> It is remarked in the text, that the condition of the slaves on Java
is very different from that of the same class in the West Indies. The
former are employed rather as administering to the luxuries than the necessities
of their proprietors; and, with few exceptions, exclusively for
domestic purposes. There are some who having taught their slaves when
young to embroider, or exercise some useful handicraft or trade, obtain
a livelihood by means of their services, and some few employ their slaves
on their estates, or let them out to hire; but the general condition of the
slaves is that of domestic servants.
</p>
<p>
The regulations and colonial statutes respecting slavery seem to have
been framed on the principles of humanity, and with attention to the
genius of the Christian religion; yet, in consequence of the supplementary
force of the Roman law in the Dutch system of legislature, there
appeared to be one capital defect in the code, <em>viz.</em> that a slave was considered
as a real property, incapable of personal rights, from which consideration
the ill-treatment of a master towards his slave was not so much
estimated on the principle of personal injury, as that of a proprietor
abusing his own property; and although a slave, under such a system,
might obtain a portion of property for himself with the consent of his
master, his possession was always precarious, and depended on the discretion
of his proprietor (in the same manner as a <em>peculium adventitium</em>
with the Romans), becoming only the unlimited property of the slave, if
the master allowed him to keep it after his emancipation.
</p>
<p>
It was conceived, that considering the civil law only as a supplement
to the positive law, continued in force on Java under the proclamation
of the Earl of Minto of 11th September 1811, the code respecting slavery
might, together with the other parts of legislation, be amended and established,
on principles more consistent with humanity and good sense, by
a declaration, that slaves in future should not be considered as objects of
real property, but as objects possessing personal rights, and bound only
to unlimited service; and that, in consequence thereof, slaves should
never be transferred from one master to another, without their own consent
given before witnesses or a notary. That a master should possess
no other power over his slave, than to exact service in an equitable
manner; that he should inflict no corporal chastisement on him after he
had attained a certain age, nor beyond such a degree as would be given
to his children or common apprentices; that all personal wrongs done to
a slave, either by his master or by others, should be estimated by the
common rules of personal injuries, and not by the principle of a proprietor
abusing his own property; that the punishment for murder committed
by a master on his slave, should be the same as that of murder
committed on a free person; that every slave should have a right to
acquire property of his own, by his private industry or labour, or by the
bounty of others; that this property should never be removeable at the
discretion of the master; that by this property the slave should always
have a right to redeem his liberty, after having continued with his master
for the term of seven years, and on paying the sum which, on estimation,
subject to the approval of the magistrate, should at the time be thought
an adequate equivalent for his personal services.
</p>
<p>
These fundamental alterations in the code were submitted by the local
government to a higher authority, at a period when the principal proprietors
evinced a concurrence in the measure; but the provisional tenure
of the government, and the expectation of the early transfer of the island
to the crown, induced a delay, until the re-establishment of Holland as a
kingdom precluded the adoption of so essential a change.
</p>
<p>
The excuse offered by the colonists for the origin and continuance of
slavery on Java is, that on the first establishment of the Dutch in the
Eastern Islands, there did not exist, as in Western India, a class of people
calculated for domestic service; that they had, in consequence, to create a
class of domestic servants, in doing which they adopted the plan of rearing
children in their families from other countries, in preference to those in
their immediate neighbourhood, who, from their connexions and the habits
of their relatives, could never be depended upon. Whether necessity dictated
this system in the earlier periods of the Dutch establishment, or not,
is at least doubtful; but it is certain that this necessity no longer exists,
nor is there the shadow of an excuse for continuing on Java this odious
traffic and condition. The Javans, during the residence of the British on
Java, have been found perfectly trustworthy, faithful, and industrious;
and the demand was alone wanting in this, as in most cases, to create a
sufficient supply of competent domestics. The continuance of the traffic
for one day longer serves but to lower the European in the eyes of the
native, who, gratified with the measures adopted by the British government
in its suppression, stands himself pure of the foul sin. To the credit
of the Javan character, and the honour of the individual, it should be
known, that when the proclamation of the British government was published,
requiring the registration of all slaves, and declaring that such as
were not registered by a certain day should be entitled to their emancipation,
the Panámbahan of Súmenap, who had inherited in his family domestic
slaves to the number of not less than fifty, proudly said, "Then
I will not register my slaves​&mdash;they shall be free: hitherto they have
been kept such, because it was the custom, and the Dutch liked to be
attended by slaves when they visited the palace; but as that is not the
case with the British, they shall cease to be slaves: for long have I
felt shame, and my blood has run cold, when I have reflected on what I
once saw at Batavia and Semárang, where human beings were exposed
for public sale, placed on a table, and examined like sheep and oxen."
</p>
<p>
The short administration of the British government on Java has fortunately
given rise to another class of domestic servants. The numerous officers
of the army, and others whose funds did not admit, or whose temporary
residence did not require a permanent establishment of servants, for the
most part usually took Javans into their service; and though these might
in the first instance, not be so well acquainted with European habits, as
slaves who had been brought up from their infancy in Dutch families, yet
they gradually improved, and were, in the end, for the most part very generally
preferred. Let not, therefore, necessity be again urged as a plea
for continuing the traffic.
</p>
<p>
The measures actually adopted by the British government may be
summed up in a few words. The importation was, in the first instance,
restricted within a limited age, and the duty on importation doubled. An
annual registry of all slaves above a certain age was taken, and slaves not
registered within a certain time declared free. A fee of one Spanish dollar
was demanded for the registry of each slave, the amount of which constituted
a fund for the relief of widows and orphans. On the promulgation
of the act of the British legislature, declaring the further traffic in slaves
to be felony, that act, with all its provisions, was at once made a colonial
law. Masters were precluded from sending their slaves to be confined in
jail at their pleasure, as had hitherto been the case, and all committals
were required to be made through the magistrates, in the same manner as
in the case of other offenders.
</p>
<p>
These general regulations, with the more rigid enforcement of the prohibition
of further importations, and of such parts of the code of regulations
for ameliorating the condition of the slaves as had become obsolete,
were all to which the local government felt itself competent; but it gave
its sanction to an institution set on foot by the English, and joined in by
many of the Dutch inhabitants, which took for its basis the principles of
the African Institution, and directed its immediate care to a provision for
the numerous slaves restored to liberty.</p></div>

<p>The island of Java is a great agricultural country; its soil is
the grand source of its wealth. In its cultivation the inhabitants
exert their chief industry, and upon its produce they
rely, not only for their subsistence, but the few articles of foreign
luxury or convenience which they purchase. The Javans
are a nation of husbandmen, and exhibit that simple
structure of society incident to such a stage of its progress.
To the crop the mechanic looks immediately for his wages,
the soldier for his pay, the magistrate for his salary, the priest
for his stipend (or <em>jákat</em>), and the government for its tribute.
The wealth of a province or village is measured by the extent
and fertility of its land, its facilities for rice irrigation, and the
number of its buffaloes.</p>

<p>When government wishes to raise supplies from particular
districts, it does not enquire how many rupees or dollars it
can yield in taxes, but what contribution of rice or maize it
can furnish, and the impost is assessed accordingly: the officer
of revenue becomes a surveyor of land or a measurer of produce,
and the fruits of the harvest are brought immediately
into the ways and means of the treasury. When a chief gives
his assistance in the police or the magistracy, he is paid by
so much village land, or the rent of so much land realized in
produce; and a native prince has no other means of pensioning
a favourite or rewarding a useful servant. "Be it known
to the high officers of my palace, to my <em>Bopátis</em> (regents),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Vol I Pg 118]</a></span>
and to my <em>Mántris (petite noblesse)</em>," says a Javan patent
of nobility granted by Sultan <em>Hamángku Búana</em>, "that I
have given this letter to my servant to raise him from the
earth, bestowing upon him, for his subsistence, lands to
the amount of eleven hundred <em>cháchas</em>, the labour of eleven
hundred men." By the population returns, and by the
number of leases granted under the late settlement, it appears,
that sometimes there is not more than a tenth part of the inhabitants
employed in any other branch of industry. Out of
a population of 243,268 in the <em>Priáng'en</em> regencies, 209,125
are stated as employed in agriculture. In <em>Surabáya</em>, the
proportion of householders who are cultivators, is to the rest
of the inhabitants as 32,618 to 634; in <em>Semárang</em>, as 58,206
to 21,404; in <em>Rembang</em> it is as 103,230 to 55,300; and in
other districts there are considerable variations: but it rarely
happens, that the people employed in trade, in manufactures,
in handicrafts, or other avocations, amount to a half of those
engaged in agriculture, or a third of the whole population.
The proportion, on an average, may be stated as three and a
half or four to one. In England, it is well known, the ratio
is reversed, its agricultural population being to its general
population as one to three or two and a half. By the surveys
lately made under the orders of the British government, we
are enabled to describe the processes of Javan agriculture,
and to state its results with more accuracy and in greater detail,
than can be attained on many subjects of superior public
interest. If we avail ourselves of these means pretty largely,
it is not so much in the hope of increasing the stock of agricultural
knowledge, as of assisting the reader to form an estimate
of the character, habits, wants, and resources of the
Javan.</p>

<p>The soil of Java, though in many parts much neglected, is
remarkable for the abundance and variety of its productions.
With very little care or exertion on the part of the cultivator,
it yields all that the wants of the island demand, and is
capable of supplying resources far above any thing that the
indolence or ignorance of the people, either oppressed under
the despotism of their own sovereigns, or harassed by the
rapacity of strangers, have yet permitted them to enjoy. Lying
under a tropical sun, it produces, as before observed, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Vol I Pg 119]</a></span>
the fruits of a tropical climate; while, in many districts, its
mountains and eminences make up for the difference of latitude,
and give it, though only a few degrees from the line, all
the advantages of temperate regions. The <em>bámbu</em>, the cocoa-nut
tree, the sugar-cane, the cotton tree, and the coffee plant,
here flourish in the greatest luxuriance, and yield products of
the best quality. Rice, the great staple of subsistence, covers
the slopes of mountains and the low fields, and gives a return
of thirty, forty, or fifty fold; while maize, or even wheat and
rye, and the other plants of Europe, may be cultivated to advantage
on high and inland situations. Such is the fertility
of the soil, that in some places after yielding two, and sometimes
three crops in the year, it is not necessary even to
change the culture. Water, which is so much wanted, and
which is seldom found in requisite abundance in tropical regions,
here flows in the greatest plenty. The cultivator who
has prepared his <em>sáwah</em>, or rice field, within its reach, diverts
part of it from its channel, spreads it out into numerous canals
of irrigation, and thus procures from it, under a scorching sun,
the verdure of the rainy season, and in due time a plentiful
harvest. Nothing can be conceived more beautiful to the eye,
or more gratifying to the imagination, than the prospect of the
rich variety of hill and dale, of rich plantations and fruit trees
or forests, of natural streams and artificial currents, which presents
itself to the eye in several of the eastern and middle provinces,
at some distance from the coast. In some parts of
<em>Kedú</em>, <em>Banyumás</em>, <em>Semárang</em>, <em>Pasúruan</em>, and <em>Málang</em>, it is
difficult to say whether the admirer of landscape, or the cultivator
of the ground, will be most gratified by the view. The
whole country, as seen from mountains of considerable elevation,
appears a rich, diversified, and well watered garden,
animated with villages, interspersed with the most luxuriant
fields, and covered with the freshest verdure.</p>

<p>Over far the greater part, seven-eighths of the island, the
soil is either entirely neglected or badly cultivated, and the
population scanty. It is by the produce of the remaining
eighth that the whole of the nation is supported; and it is
probable that, if it were all under cultivation, no area of land
of the same extent, in any other quarter of the globe, could
exceed it, either in quantity, variety, or value of its vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Vol I Pg 120]</a></span>
productions. The kind of husbandry in different districts (as
shall be mentioned afterwards more particularly) depends upon
the nature and elevation of the ground, and the facilities for
natural or artificial irrigation. The best lands are those situated
in the vallies of the higher districts, or on the slopes of
mountains, and on the plains stretching from them, as such
lands are continually enriched with accessions of new earth
washed down from the hills by the periodical rains. The
poorest soil is that found on the ranges of low hills, termed
<em>kéndang</em>, extending along many districts, and particularly in
the southern division of the island; but in no part is it so
sterile or ungrateful, as not to afford a liberal return for the
labour bestowed upon its cultivation, especially if a supply
of water can be by any means directed upon it.</p>

<p>But when nature does much for a country, its inhabitants
are sometimes contented to do little, and, satisfied with its
common gifts, neglect to improve them into the means of dignity
or comfort. The peasantry of Java, easily procuring the
necessaries of life, seldom aim at improvement of their condition.
Rice is the principal food of all classes of the people,
and the great staple of their agriculture. Of this necessary
article, it is calculated that a labourer can, in ordinary circumstances,
earn from four to five <em>kátis</em> a day; and a <em>káti</em>
being equivalent to one pound and a quarter avoirdupois, is
reckoned a sufficient allowance for the daily subsistence of an
adult in these regions. The labour of the women on Java is
estimated almost as highly as that of the men, and thus a married
couple can maintain eight or ten persons; and as a family
seldom exceeds half that number, they have commonly half
of their earnings applicable for the purchase of little comforts,
for implements of agriculture, for clothing and lodging. The
two last articles cannot be expensive in a country where the
children generally go naked, and where the simplest structure
possible is sufficient to afford the requisite protection against
the elements.</p>

<p>The price of rice, which thus becomes of importance to the
labourer, varies in different parts of the island, according to the
fertility of the district where it is produced, its situation with
regard to a market, or its distance from one of the numerous
provincial capitals. As the means of transport, by which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Vol I Pg 121]</a></span>
abundance of one district might be conveyed to supply the deficiencies
of another, and to equalize the distribution of the general
stock, are few and laborious, this variation of price is
sometimes very considerable: even in the same district there
are great variations, according to the nature of the crop. In the
Native Provinces, a <em>píkul</em> (weighing 133⅓ lbs. English) sometimes
sells below the fourth part of a Spanish dollar, and at
other times for more than two Spanish dollars; but in common
years, and at an average over the whole island, including
the capital, the estimate may be taken at thirty Spanish dollars
the <em>kóyan</em> of thirty <em>píkuls</em>, or three thousand <em>kútis</em>. A
<em>kúti</em> of rice, according to this estimate, may be sold to the
consumer, after allowing a sufficient profit to the retail merchant,
for much less than a penny.</p>

<p>But though the price of this common article of subsistence
may be of some consequence to the Javan labourer, when he
wants to make any purchase with his surplus portion, he is
rendered independent of the fluctuations of the market for his
necessary food, by the mode in which he procures it. He is
generally the cultivator of the soil; and while he admits that
law of custom, which assigns to the superior a certain share
of the produce, he claims an equal right himself to the remainder,
which is generally sufficient to support himself and
his family: and he sometimes finds in this law of custom,
sanctioned by the interest of both parties, a security in the
possession of his lands, and a barrier against the arbitrary
exactions of his chief, which could scarcely be expected
under the capricious despotism of a Mahomedan government.
In addition to this reserved share, he raises on his own account,
if he is industrious, within what may be termed the
cottage farm, all the vegetables, fruit, and poultry requisite
for his own consumption. His wife invariably manufactures
the slight articles of clothing, which, in such a climate, the
common people are in the habit of wearing. What can be
spared of the fruits of their joint industry from the supply
of their immediate wants, is carried to market, and exchanged
for a little salt fish, dried meat, or for other trifling comforts,
hoarded as a store for the purchase of an ox or a
buffalo, or expended in procuring materials for repairing the
hut and mending the implements of husbandry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Vol I Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>The farming stock of the cultivator is as limited as his
wants are few and his cottage inartificial: it usually consists
of a pair of buffaloes or oxen, and a few rude implements
of husbandry. There is a small proportion of sheep and
goats on the island; but, with the exception of poultry, no
kind of live stock is reared exclusively either for the butcher
or the dairy. By the returns made in 1813 of the
stock and cattle of the provinces under the British government,
containing a population of nearly two millions and a
half, it was found that there were only about five thousand
sheep and twenty-four thousand goats. The number of buffaloes,
by the same return, and in the same space, was
stated at 402,054, and of oxen at 122,691. Horses abound
in the island, but are principally employed about the capitals,
and not in husbandry, further than in the transport of produce
from one district to another.</p>

<p>The buffalo and ox are used for ploughing. The former is
of a smaller size than the buffalo of Sumatra and the Peninsula,
though larger than that of Bengal and of the islands
lying eastward of Java. It is a strong tractable animal, capable
of long and continued exertion, but it cannot bear the
heat of the mid-day sun. It is shy of Europeans, but submits
to be managed by the smallest child of the family in which it
is domesticated. The buffalo is either black or white: the
former is larger and generally considered superior. In the
<em>Súnda</em>, or western and mountainous districts, nine out of ten
are white, which is not at all the case in the low countries; no
essential difference in the breed has been discovered to be
connected with this remarkable distinction of colour. The
usual price of a buffalo in the western districts is about
twenty-four rupees for the black, and twenty rupees for the
white; in the eastern districts the price varies from twelve to
sixteen rupees. The <em>Súnda</em> term for a buffalo is <em>múnding</em>;
the Javan, <em>máisa</em> and <em>kébo</em>: and in compliment to <em>Laléan</em>,
the prince who is supposed to have introduced cultivation into
the <em>Súnda</em> districts, that prince and his successors on the
<em>Súnda</em> throne are distinguished by the appellation <em>Múnding</em>
or <em>Máisa</em>. The name of the individual sovereigns enters into a
compound with these general terms for the dynasty, and they
are called <em>Máisa-laléan</em>, <em>Múnding-sári</em>, and so of others.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Vol I Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>The ox of Java derives its origin from the Indian breed.
Two varieties are common: that which is called the Javan ox
has considerably degenerated; the other, which is termed the
Bengal or Surat ox, is distinguished by a lump on the
shoulder, and retains in his superior strength other traces of
his origin. The bull after castration is used as a beast of
burden, for the draught, and sometimes for the stall. Cows
are chiefly employed in husbandry, and are particularly useful
to the poorer class; but in the <em>sáwah</em> and the extensive inundated
plantations of the low districts of the island, the superior
bulk and strength of the buffalo is indispensable. Eastward
of <em>Pasúruan</em>, however, the lands are ploughed by oxen and
cows exclusively. The wild breed, termed <em>bánténg</em>, is found
principally in the forests of that quarter and in <em>Báli</em>, although
it occurs also in other parts; a remarkable change takes place
in the appearance of this animal after castration, the colour in
a few months invariably becoming red.</p>

<p>The cows on Java, as well as throughout the Archipelago,
remarkably degenerate from those properties, for which, in a
state of domestication, they are chiefly prized in other quarters
of the world, and afford little or no milk beyond what is
barely sufficient for the nourishment of the calf: but the
draught ox does not partake of a similar change, and in the
central and eastern districts, particularly where the pasture is
good, becomes a strong active animal. The degenerate domestic
cows are sometimes driven into the forests, to couple
with the wild <em>bánténg</em>, for the sake of improving the breed.
A single pair of oxen, or buffaloes, is found sufficient for the
yoke both of the plough and harrow; and these form by far
the most expensive part of the cultivator's stock. The price
of a draught ox, in the central and eastern districts, in which
they are more generally used in agriculture, varies from eight
to sixteen rupees, or from twenty to forty shillings English,
and a cow may be purchased for about the same price.
Either from the luxuriance of the pasture, the greater care of
the husbandmen, or a more equal climate, both the buffalo and
the ox are usually in better condition on Java than in many
parts of India: indeed, those miserable half-starved looking
animals, with which some of the provinces of Bengal abound,
are never seen in this island, except, perhaps, occasionally, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Vol I Pg 124]</a></span>
some of the few herds belonging to Europeans, in the vicinity
of Batavia.</p>

<p>Buffaloes, however, more than other domestic animals, are
subject to an epidemic disease, the symptoms and nature of
which have not been hitherto carefully noted, or satisfactorily
explained. It prevails throughout the whole island, and
generally re-appears after an interval of three, four, or five
years: it makes great ravages in the stock of the peasantry,
and is checked in its progress by no remedies which have
hitherto been discovered or applied: it is of an infectious
nature, and excites great alarm when it appears: it bears different
names in different parts of the island. As the bull and
cow are not liable to this disease; and as, in addition to this
advantage, they are less expensive in their original purchase,
they are preferred by many of the natives.</p>

<p>For draught, the buffalo and cow are employed; and for
burden, the horse (particularly mares) and the ox. In level
districts, and in good roads, the use of the latter is preferred.
The usual burden of a horse is rather less than three hundred
weight, and that of an ox rather more than four; but in
mountainous districts, and where the roads are neglected, one
half of this weight is considered as a sufficient, if not an excessive
load.</p>

<p>The comparatively higher price of cattle on Java than in
Bengal has been accounted for from the demand for them
as food, and the absence of extensive commons on which to
feed them.</p>

<p>When implements of husbandry are mentioned in British
agriculture, many expensive instruments, and complicated
machinery suggest themselves to those acquainted with its
practical details. From the preparation of the ground for
receiving the seed, till the grain comes into the hands of the
miller, labour is economized and produce increased, by many
ingenious processes and artful contrivances, of which a Javan
could form no conception. He could form no idea of the
fabrication or advantages of our different kinds of ploughs; of
our swing ploughs, our wheel ploughs, and our two-furrow
ploughs; of our grubbers, cultivators, and other instruments
for pulverizing the soil; of our threshing and winnowing
machines, and other inventions. A plough of the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Vol I Pg 125]</a></span>
construction, a harrow, or rather rake, and sometimes a roller,
with a <em>páchul</em>, or hoe, which answers the purpose of a spade;
an <em>árit</em>, which serves as a knife or small hatchet; and the <em>áni
áni</em>, a peculiar instrument used by the reapers, are all the implements
employed by him in husbandry; and the total cost
of the whole does not exceed three or four rupees, or from
seven to ten shillings.</p>

<p>The plough (<em>walúku</em>), in general use for the irrigated
land, consists of three parts, the body, beam, and handle. It
is generally made of teak wood, where that material can be
provided, or otherwise of the most durable that can be found:
the yoke only is of <em>bámbu</em>. Simple as it is, it appears, both
in its construction and durability, superior to the plough of
Bengal, as described by Mr. Colebrooke, from which it differs,
in having a board cut out of the piece which forms the body,
for throwing the earth aside. The point of the body, or sock,
is tipped with iron, which in some districts is cast for the
purpose. There is another kind, of more simple construction,
in use for dry and mountain cultivation: this is termed <em>brújul</em>,
and consists of but two parts. Both kinds are so light, that
when the ploughman has performed his morning's work, he
throws the plough over his shoulder, and without feeling any
inconvenience or fatigue, returns with it to his cottage. For
gardens, and for small fields adjoining the villages, the small
<em>lúku chína</em>, or Chinese plough, is used with one buffalo: the
cost for a good plough seldom exceeds a rupee and a half.
The harrow (<em>gáru</em>), which is rather a large rake having only
a single rough row of teeth, costs about the same sum, and is
in like manner made of teak where procurable; except the
handle, beam, and yoke, which are of <em>bámbu</em>. When used,
the person who guides it generally sits upon it, to give it the
necessary pressure for levelling or pulverizing the soil.</p>

<p>The <em>páchul</em> is a large hoe, which in Java serves every purpose
of the spade in Europe, and is consequently, next to the
plough, the most important implement in Javan husbandry.
The head is of wood tipped with iron; and the handle, which
is about two feet and a half long, frequently has a slight curve,
which renders it more convenient for use: its price is about
half a rupee. The <em>árit</em>, or weeding knife, costs about eight
pence; and the <em>áni áni</em>, with which the grain is reaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Vol I Pg 126]</a></span>
about three pence. The latter is a small instrument of peculiar
shape. The reaper holds it in a particular manner, and crops
off with it each separate ear, along with a few inches of the
straw. This mode of reaping has been immemorially practised
and is universally followed. Some of the most intelligent people
being questioned respecting the origin of this operose process,
answered, that it was reported to have been established
in ancient times as a <em>s'lámat</em>, or grateful acknowledgment for
an abundant harvest; that when his field was covered with
the bounty of Ceres, no reaper could refuse her this acknowledgment;
and that the religious discharge of this obligation
was guarded by the belief, that if he ceased to offer this tribute
of his labour at the season of harvest, the field would not continue
to yield him the same abundant return.</p>

<p>The lands are ploughed, harrowed, and weeded by the men,
who also conduct the whole process of irrigation; but the
labour of transplanting, reaping, and (where cattle are not
used for the purpose) of transporting the different crops from
the field to the village, or from the village to the market, devolves
upon the women.</p>

<p>Besides the two general divisions of the year, marked out
by nature in the great changes of the earth and the atmosphere,
there are other periodical distinctions, depending on less
obvious or more irregular phenomena. These variations have
been ascertained by a reference to the course of the heavenly
bodies, or the calculations of the <em>wúku</em>, which are described
in another part of this work. It is the office of the village
priest to keep this reckoning, and to apprize the cultivators
when the term approaches for the commencement of the different
operations of husbandry. Of these minor seasons of
the year, the first, commencing after the rice harvest which
falls in August or September, lasts forty-one days. During
this season the leaves fall from the trees, vegetation is interrupted,
and the only field labour performed is the burning of
grass and vegetables, as a preparation of the <em>tégal</em> or <em>gágas</em>.
In the second season, which lasts twenty-five days, vegetation
again resumes its vigour. The third, which lasts twenty-four
days, is considered the most proper for planting sweet potatoes,
yams, and such other vegetables as usually form the
second crop; the wild flowers of the forest are now in blossom;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Vol I Pg 127]</a></span>
and the period of what is termed dry cultivation commences.
The fourth, which lasts also twenty-four days, is the natural
season for the pairing of wild animals: high winds now prevail,
the rains descend, and the rivers begin to rise. During
the fifth, which lasts twenty-six days, the implements of
husbandry are prepared, and the water-courses examined and
renewed: this is the commencement of the wet cultivation.
In the sixth season the ploughing of the <em>sáwahs</em> and sowing
of the <em>bíbít</em> for the great rice crop takes place: this season
lasts forty-one days. In the seventh, which also lasts forty-one
days, <em>pári</em> is transplanted into fields, and the courses of
the water properly directed. In the eighth, which lasts
twenty-six days, the plants shoot above the water and begin
to blossom. In the ninth season, which consists of twenty-five
days, the ears of the grain form. In the tenth, also consisting
of twenty-five days, they ripen and turn yellow. The
eleventh, which lasts twenty-six days, is the period for reaping;
and in the twelfth, which consists of forty-one days, the
harvest is completed, the produce gathered in, and that dry
clear weather prevails, in which the days are the hottest and
the nights the coldest of the whole year. The accurate assignment
of the number of days by the natives themselves to
the different operations of husbandry, affords such complete
information on this interesting subject, that any further account
would be superfluous. It may, however, be proper to
observe, that the periods above described chiefly refer to the
progress of the principal rice crop, as influenced by the annual
rains; but there are many lands rendered quite independent
of these rains, by the vicinity of streams which afford a plentiful
supply of water at all times of the year. In many favoured
situations, it is even common to observe at one view the rice
fields in almost every stage of their cultivation; in one, women
engaged in planting the newly prepared soil, and in
another, the reapers employed in collecting the fruits of the
harvest.</p>

<p>Lands in Java are classed under two general divisions;
lands which are capable of being inundated directly from
streams or rivers, and lands which are not so. The former
are termed <em>sáwah</em>, the latter <em>tégal</em> or <em>gága</em>. It is on the
<em>sáwahs</em> that the great rice cultivation is carried on; and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Vol I Pg 128]</a></span>
admit of a subdivision, according to the manner in which the
land is irrigated. Those which can be irrigated at pleasure
from adjacent springs or rivers, are considered as the
proper <em>sáwah</em>; those which depend on the periodical rains
for the whole or principal part of the water by which they are
fertilized, are termed <em>sáwah tádahan</em>. The former are by far
the most valuable, and lands of this description admit of two
heavy crops annually, without regard to any particular time of
the year: the fields seldom exceed forty or sixty feet in
breadth, and the water is retained in them by means of a
small embankment of about a foot in height. On the slopes
of the mountains, where this mode of cultivation is chiefly
found, these fields are carried gradually above each other in
so many terraces, for the purpose of irrigation, the water admitted
in the upper terrace inundating each of them in its
descent. The <em>tégal</em> lands are appropriated to the culture of
less important crops, such as the mountain rice, Indian
corn, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The vast superiority of the <em>sáwah</em>, or wet cultivation, over
that of <em>tégal</em>, or dry, is shewn in their relative produce, and
may be still further illustrated by a comparison of the rents
which the two descriptions of land are calculated to afford.
The quantity of <em>tégal</em> land, or land fit for maize, as compared
with that of <em>sáwah</em> land, varies in different districts. In <em>Chéribon</em>,
the <em>tégal</em> land, by the late survey, amounted only to
2,511, while the <em>sáwan</em> exceeded 16,000. In <em>Tégal</em> the proportions
were even more widely varied, the number of
<em>jungs</em> of the former to the latter being as 891 to 11,445. In
<em>Surabáya</em> they were as 1,356 to 17,397; in <em>Kedú</em> and <em>Besúki</em>
they were nearly equal, being respectively as 8,295 to 10,757,
and as 6,369 to 7,862.</p>

<p>The succession of crops, next to the facility of irrigation,
depends upon the quality of the soil, which in the native provinces
is divided by the cultivators into three principal kinds,
<em>tána ládu</em>, <em>tána línchad</em>, and <em>tána pásir</em>. The first is the best,
consisting of rich vegetable mould, and a certain proportion of
sand, and exists chiefly near the banks of large rivers; the second
is almost pure clay, and is found in the central plains; and
the third is alluvial, and covers the maritime districts. The
term <em>pádas péréng</em> is applied to the oblique tracts enriched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Vol I Pg 129]</a></span>
with a fertile mould, which form the acclivities of hills, and
from which the water readily disappears. <em>Tána ládu</em> will
bear a constant succession of crops. <em>Tána línchad</em> yields
only a single annual crop of rice: during the rainy season the
soil constitutes a stiff mud, in which the plants find the requisite
moisture and display all their luxuriance; when it is
afterwards exposed to the rays of the sun, it bursts into extensive
fissures, which admitting the scorching heat by which
they were produced, become detrimental to every species of
vegetation.</p>

<p>Besides the annual crop of rice which is raised on the
<em>sáwah</em> lands, a variety of plants are raised upon them as a second
or light crop within the same year. Among these are
several species of <em>káchang</em> or bean, the cotton plant, the indigo,
and a variety of cucumbers, &amp;c. But the more generally
useful and profitable vegetables require nearly the same
period as the rice, and only yield their increase once in a
season: they mostly grow in situations, on which the supply
of water can be regulated, and a continued inundation prevented.
Among the most important are the <em>gúdé</em>, <em>káchang
pénden</em>, or <em>káchang chína</em>, <em>káchang íju</em>, <em>kédéle</em>, <em>jágung</em> or Indian
corn, <em>jágung chántel</em>, <em>jáwa-wút</em>, <em>jáli</em>, <em>wíjen</em>, <em>járak</em> or
palma christi, <em>térong</em>, and <em>kéntang jáwa</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>tégal</em> lands of high situations a particular method of
planting is sometimes practiced, which produces a result similar
to a succession of crops. Together with the rice are
deposited the seeds of other vegetables, which arrive at maturity
at different periods, chiefly after the rice harvest. The
most common and useful among these is cotton; and, in some
tracts, great quantities of this valuable product is thus obtained,
without any exclusive allotment of the soil. Next to
this are various leguminous and other plants, which do not
interfere with the rice. No less than six or eight kinds of
vegetables are sometimes in this manner seen to shoot up promiscuously
in a single field.</p>

<p>Rice, however, as has been repeatedly observed, is the
grand staple of Javan, as well as Indian cultivation, and to
this every other species of husbandry is subordinate. The
adjacent islands and states of Sumatra, Malacca, Borneo,
Celebes, and the Moluccas, have always in a great measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Vol I Pg 130]</a></span>
depended on the Javan cultivator for their supply, and the
Dutch were in the habit of transporting an annual quantity of
between six and eight thousand tons to Ceylon, to Coromandel,
to the Cape, and their other settlements. Even at the
low rate at which it generally sells, a revenue of near four
million of rupees, or about half a million sterling, has been
estimated as the government portion of its annual produce.</p>

<p>According to the modes of cultivation by which it has been
reared, this grain is called <em>pári sáwah</em>, or <em>pári gága</em>; corresponding,
with some exceptions, to the <em>pádi sáwah</em>, and <em>pádi
ládang</em> of Sumatra. In the western, and particularly the
<em>Súnda</em> districts, the term <em>gága</em> is changed for <em>típar</em>, the term
<em>gága</em>, in these districts, being only occasionally applied to the
grain which is cultivated on newly cleared mountainous spots.</p>

<p>The lowland and the mountain rice, or more correctly
speaking, the rice raised in dry lands and the rice raised in
lands subjected to inundation, are varieties of the same species
(the oriza sativa of Linnæus) although both of them are permanent:
but the rice planted on the mountainous or dry
ground does not thrive on irrigated lands; nor, on the contrary,
does the <em>sáwah</em> rice succeed on lands beyond the reach
of irrigation. The mountain rice is supposed to contain in
the same bulk more nourishment than the other, and is more
palatable; but its use is limited to the less populous districts
of the island, the greater proportion of the inhabitants depending
exclusively on the produce of the <em>sáwahs</em>, or wet cultivation,
for their support.</p>

<p>Stavorinus asserts, that the mountain rice is not so good as
that of the low lands. Mr. Marsden informs us, on the contrary,
that the former brings the higher price, and is considered
of superior quality, being whiter, heartier, and better
flavoured grain, keeping better, and increasing more in
boiling. "The rice of the low lands," he says, "is more
prolific from the seed, and subject to less risk in the culture;
and on these accounts, rather than from its superior
quality, is in more common use than the former." In
general, the weightiest and whitest grain is preferred; a preference
mentioned by Bontius, who includes in the character
of the best rice its whiteness, its clearness of colour, and its
preponderating weight, bulk for bulk. Dr. Horsfield con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Vol I Pg 131]</a></span>ceives
that Stavorinus formed his opinion in the low northern
maritime districts of Java, and Mr. Marsden from a more
extensive observation. Many intelligent natives state, that
they prefer the mountain rice when they can procure it, on
account of its whiteness, strength, and flavour; and that they
are only limited in its use, by the impossibility of raising as
much of it as can satisfy the general demand, all the mountain
or dry rice not being sufficient to feed one-tenth of the
population. In less populous countries, as in many parts of
Sumatra, the inhabitants can easily subsist the whole of their
numbers exclusively on mountain rice, or that produced on
<em>ládangs</em>, which are fields reclaimed from ancient forests for
the first time, and from which only one crop is demanded.
The grain here, as in the mountain rice of Java, is highly
flavoured and nutritious; but in countries where the population
is crowded, where a scanty crop will not suffice, and
where a continued supply of new land cannot be obtained,
the peasantry must apply their labour to such grounds as
admit of uninterrupted cultivation, and renew their annual
fertility by periodical inundations, even although the produce
is not so highly prized.</p>

<p>In the <em>sáwahs</em> of Java the fields are previously ploughed,
inundated, and laboured by animals and hoeing, until the
mould is converted into a semifluid mire: they then are considered
fit to receive the young plants. No manure is ever
used. Oil-cakes (<em>búngkil</em>), which are by some writers supposed
to be used for this purpose generally, are only employed
in the gardens about Batavia. One of the chief characteristics
of the soil on Java, is an exemption from the necessity
of requiring manure: on the <em>sáwah</em> lands, the annual
inundation of the land is sufficient to renovate its vigour, and
to permit constant cropping for a succession of years, without
any observable impoverishment.</p>

<p>In the cultivation of the <em>sáwahs</em>, the plants are uniformly
transplanted or removed from their first situation. In those
of <em>tégal</em> or <em>gága</em>, they grow to maturity on the same spot
where the seed was originally deposited, whether this be on
high mountainous districts, or on low lands, the distinction of
<em>sáwah</em> and <em>gága</em> depending exclusively not upon the situa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Vol I Pg 132]</a></span>tion
of the field, but in the mode of culture, whether wet
or dry.</p>

<p>In raising rice in the <em>sáwahs</em>, inundation is indispensable
till it is nearly ripe. The seed is first sown on a bed prepared
for the purpose, about one month before the season for
transplanting it, and the plant is during that time termed
<em>bíbit</em>. Two methods are in use. According to the first,
called <em>úrit</em>, the ears of <em>pári</em> are carefully disposed on the soft
mud of the seed bed; in the second, called <em>ng'éber</em>, the separated
seeds are thrown after the manner of broadcast in
Europe. In by far the greatest portions of the island, the
ground is prepared, the seed sown, and the plant removed,
during the course of the rainy season, or between the months
of November and March. In situations where a constant
supply of water can be obtained from springs, rivulets, or
rivers, two crops are produced in the course of twelve or
fourteen months; but the advantage of double cropping,
which exhausts the soil without allowing it time to recover,
has been considered as very questionable. If in some situations
commanding a supply of water, the earth is allowed to
rest after the preceding harvest, during the latter end of the
rainy season, and the transplantation made in the months of
June and July, it generally yields more profitable crops than
the common method of working the <em>sáwah</em>. This, which is
termed <em>gádu</em> by the natives, has been recommended by the
experience of European planters.</p>

<p>Irrigation is exclusively effected by conducting the water
of rivers and rivulets from the more or less elevated spots
in the vicinity, and in this respect, differs materially in its
process from that of Bengal, for although considerable labour
and ingenuity are exercised in detaining, regulating, and distributing
the supply, by means of dams, called <em>bandáng'ans</em>,
no machinery whatever is employed in raising water for agricultural
purposes in any part of the island.</p>

<p>The rice grown on <em>sáwahs</em>, is of two kinds, <em>pári génja</em> and
<em>pári dálam</em>. In the former, the harvest takes place four
months after the transplantation; in the latter, six months.
<em>Pári génja</em> having the advantage of a quicker growth, is
therefore often planted when the rainy season is far advanced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Vol I Pg 133]</a></span>
<em>Pári dálam</em> is more prolific, and yields a grain of superior
quality, comprising those varieties in which the ears are
longer and more compound. The varieties of each kind are
distinct and permanent.</p>

<p>The subvarieties are very numerous, amounting, with those
of <em>kétan</em>, to more than a hundred. <em>Kétan</em> is a distinct variety,
with very glutinous seeds, seldom employed as an article of
food, except in confections, cakes, and the like. Of the
varieties of the <em>pári génsha</em>, <em>mentik</em> and <em>anchar bántap</em> are
preferred. Of the <em>pári dálam</em>, those of <em>krentúlan</em> and <em>súka
nándi</em> are most esteemed, being remarkably well flavoured
and fit for keeping. <em>S'lámat jáwa</em> yields also rice of good
quality. The bearded kinds of <em>pári</em> are always preferred for
keeping, as the grains do not readily fall off. Near <em>Súra-kérta</em>,
the principal native capital, close to the site of the
former capital <em>Kérta-súra</em>, there is a peculiar tract inundated
by water from a fountain at <em>Píng'gíng</em>, which is said to
produce a grain of very superior flavour, from which the table
of the <em>Susuhúnan</em> is supplied. <em>Súka nándi</em> is the kind uniformly
preferred for these plantations.</p>

<p>For <em>pári gága</em>, whether in high or low situations, the
ground is prepared by ploughing and harrowing, and the
seed is planted after the manner called setting in some parts
of England. The holes are made by pointed sticks, called
<em>pónchos</em>, and into each hole two seeds are thrown. Only
careless husbandmen, or those who cannot procure the
requisite assistance in their labour, sow by broadcast. In
high situations the earth is prepared before the rains commence:
the seed is sown in the months of September or
October, and the harvest takes place in January and February
following. <em>Gágas</em> of low situations are planted about a
month after the harvest of the <em>sáwah</em> is got in, and frequently
receive temporary supplies of water from a neighbouring
rivulet. In high situations, to which water cannot be carried,
they are sufficiently moistened by the first rains of the season.
During their growth, they receive several hoeings from the
careful husbandman.</p>

<p>As the grain ripens, an elevated shed is frequently erected
in the centre of a plantation, within which a child on the
watch touches, from time to time, a series of cords extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Vol I Pg 134]</a></span>
from the shed to the extremities of the field, like the radii of
a circle, and by this cheap contrivance, and an occasional
shout, prevents the ravages of birds, which would otherwise
prove highly injurious to the crops. These little elevated sheds
in the interior, and particularly in the district of <em>Bányumás</em>,
are very neatly constructed of matting.</p>

<p>The reapers are uniformly paid, by receiving a portion of
the crop which they have reaped: this varies in different parts
of the island, from the sixth to the eighth part, depending on
the abundance or scarcity of hands; when the harvest is general
through a district, one-fifth or one-fourth is demanded by
the reaper. In opposition to so exorbitant a claim, the influence
of the great is sometimes exerted, and the labourer is
obliged to be content with a tenth or a twelfth.</p>

<p>The grain is separated from the husk by pounding several
times repeated. The first operation is generally performed in
wooden troughs, in the villages near which it grows, and before
it is brought to market. The <em>pári</em> being thus converted
into <em>bras</em> or rice, afterwards receives repeated poundings, according
to the condition or taste of the consumer.</p>

<p>With the exception of the rice raised in <em>sáwahs</em>, all other
produce is cultivated on dry grounds, either on the <em>sáwah</em>
fields during the dry season, or on <em>tégal</em> land, at all times exclusively
appropriated to dry cultivation. The principal article
next to rice, as affording food to man, is maize or Indian
corn, termed <em>jágung</em>. It is general in every district of Java,
but is more particularly an object of attention on <em>Madúra</em>,
where, for want of mountain streams, the lands do not in general
admit of irrigation. In the more populous parts of Java,
likewise, where the <em>sáwahs</em> do not afford a sufficient supply of
rice, the inhabitants have lately had recourse to the cultivation
of maize. It is now rapidly increasing in those low
ranges of hills, which, on account of the poverty of the soil,
had hitherto been neglected, and is becoming more and more
a favourite article of food. In the more eastern districts, it is
procured from the inhabitants of <em>Madúra</em> in exchange for rice.
It is generally roasted in the ear, and in that state is exposed
while hot for public sale; but it is never reduced to flour, or
stored for any considerable time.</p>

<p>The <em>zea maize</em>, or common <em>jágung</em>, is a hardy plant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Vol I Pg 135]</a></span>
grows on any soil. In common with every other production
of Java it thrives there most luxuriantly; nor is there any
reason to believe, that the Javan soil is less adapted to it than
that of Spanish America, where Humboldt estimates its produce
at a hundred and fifty fold. It is planted in fertile low
lands in rotation with rice, and in high situations without intermission,
often forming in the latter the chief, if not the only,
support of the inhabitants. There are three different kinds,
distinguished from each other by their respective periods of
ripening. The first kind requires seven months, and is a
large rich grain; the second takes only three, and is of inferior
quality; and the third, which seems valuable only on account
of its rapid growth, ripens in forty days, but has a poor small
grain. They may be planted at all seasons of the year; and of
the two inferior kinds, several crops are often raised from the
same ground within the year.</p>

<p>Of other cerealia, the <em>jágung chántel</em> is raised very partially
in particular districts, at no great distance from the capitals of
the interior, and mostly for the purpose of preparing from it,
by fermentation, a liquor sometimes drunk by the natives; as
a general article of food it cannot be enumerated. The <em>jáwa-wút</em>
and <em>jáli</em> are still more confined in their use; although the
natives have a tradition, that on the first arrival of the Indian
colonists on Java, the former was the only grain found on the
island: it yields a pleasant pulp, and is made into several articles
of confectionary. As a principal article of food, or a substitute
for rice, Indian corn can alone be considered.</p>

<p>In times of scarcity, the natives make use of various kinds
of the plantain (<em>musa</em>), also the yam (<em>ubi</em> of the Malays, and
<em>uwi</em> of the Javans), the sweet potatoe, <em>katélo</em> (convolvulus batatas),
the varieties of which are described in one of the early
volumes of the Batavian Transactions, and a number of leguminous
vegetables, the various kinds of beans (<em>káchang</em>),
together with a species of grass with minute yellow seeds,
called <em>túton</em>, which in ancient times is said to have formed a
principal article of food, and the dried leaves of some other
plants; but, happily, these times seldom occur, and the use of
the <em>jágung chántel</em> and <em>jáwa-wút</em>, as well as of the various
roots and leguminous vegetables to which I have alluded, is
too limited to produce any sensible effects on the inhabitants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Vol I Pg 136]</a></span>
Those natives who make use of the Indian corn exclusively,
inhabit the highest districts, where the purity of the atmosphere
counteracts any injury which their health might otherwise
sustain from the want of rice.</p>

<p>From the <em>áren</em> (sagurus rumphii), which grows abundantly in
many parts of Java, a substance is prepared, similar in all respects
to the true sago of the Eastern Islands. It is particularly
useful in times of scarcity, when large numbers of these valuable
trees are felled, for the purpose of collecting the pith. The
sap yields an excellent sugar of a dark colour, in common use
with the natives. The wine or <em>túwak</em> (toddy) prepared from
it is superior to that obtained from most other palms.</p>

<p>A very agreeable pulp is prepared from the pith of this tree,
pounded with water, and exposed one night to spontaneous
evaporation: it is eaten with palm sugar, and found by no
means unpleasant by Europeans. The tuberous roots of a
species of curcuma, <em>tému láwak</em>, grated and infused in water,
yields a similar pulp. Both are denominated <em>pátí</em>, and daily
offered for sale along the roads and in the interior.</p>

<p>All the varieties of the cocoa-tree, noticed on Sumatra, are
to be found on Java, where its quicker and more luxuriant
growth is accounted for by the superiority of soil. The principal
varieties of the cocoa-nut are enumerated in one of the
early volumes of the Batavian Transactions.</p>

<p>Of the oil-giving plants there are many. The <em>káchang
góring</em> of the Malay countries, or, as it is indifferently termed
by the Javans, <em>káchang chína</em>, <em>pénden</em>, or <em>tána</em>, is cultivated
almost exclusively for the purpose of obtaining its oil, near the
capitals of the principal districts, both central and maritime.
It requires a very strong soil for its support, and as the cultivation
is profitable, the lands which produce it yield high
rents. It is never employed as an article of food by itself; but
what remains of it after the oil is expressed, forms an ingredient
for the seasoning of rice, in one of the common dishes of
the natives. The oil is obtained by grinding the seeds between
two grooved cylinders, and then separating it either by
expression or boiling. The former is chiefly used by the
Chinese, and yields as a refuse the oil-cakes, which I formerly
observed were employed as manure in some of the gardens
near Batavia. Where these cylinders are not in use, the fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Vol I Pg 137]</a></span>lowing
mode is adopted: the nut having been taken from the
ground, is dried by exposure to the sun for a few days; after
which the kernel is extracted, and reduced, by successive
beatings in the Javan <em>lésung</em> or mortar, to a grain sufficiently
small to pass through a sieve; it is then boiled by steam, and
having been allowed to cool for twenty-four hours, is put into
a basket, and in that state placed between two oblong planks,
which, being joined together at one extremity, are forced to
meet at the other, on the principle of a lemon-squeezer. The
oil exuding from the interstices of the basket is caught on an
ox's hide, placed below to convey it to an earthen receiver.</p>

<p>The <em>járak</em>, or palma christi, is cultivated in nearly the
same manner as maize, and thrives on similar soils: from
this plant is obtained most of the oil for burning in lamps.
In extracting the oil from this as well as from the cocoa-nut,
various processes are employed, most of which tend to accelerate
the rancidity of the oil. A pure cold drawn oil is not
known. In the cocoa-nut, if the oil is obtained by expression,
the broken nuts from which it is made are exposed till
putrefaction commences. In other cases they are grated, and
water being poured upon them, the parts mixed with it form
<em>sánten</em>, a white milky fluid, which is evaporated till the oil
alone remains. As this process requires much time and fuel,
a more economical method is often resorted to: the milky
fluid is left exposed for a night, when the oily parts rise to the
top, and being separated from the water are purified by a very
short boiling.</p>

<p>Of the sugar-cane, or according to the native term, <em>tébu</em>
(the name by which it is designated, not only on Java, but
throughout the Archipelago), there are several varieties. The
dark purple cane, which displays the greatest luxuriance,
and shoots to the length of ten feet, is the most highly prized.
By the Javans the sugar-cane is only cultivated to be eaten
in an unprepared state, as a nourishing sweetmeat. They
are unacquainted with any artificial method of expressing
from it the saccharine juice, and, consequently, with the first
material part of the process by which it is manufactured into
sugar. Satisfied with the nourishment or gratification which
they procure from the plant as nature presents it, they leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Vol I Pg 138]</a></span>
the complicated process to be conducted exclusively by the
Chinese.</p>

<p>The cane, as in the West Indies, is propagated by cuttings
of about a foot and a half long, which are inserted in the
ground in an upright direction, previously to the setting in of
the rains. The Chinese occasionally use oil-cake for enriching
the lands; but where the plant is only raised for consumption
in its fresh state, no manure whatever is thought
requisite; and a good soil, without such preparation, will
yield three or four crops in succession.</p>

<p>The cane is extensively cultivated for the juice in the vicinity
of Batavia, where there are numerous manufactories,
principally owned by the Chinese. It is also cultivated for
this purpose in considerable tracts at <em>Júpara</em> and <em>Pasúruan</em>,
and partially in other districts of the eastern provinces, where
mills are established for expressing it. Previous to the disturbances
in <em>Chéribon</em>, sugar likewise was manufactured in
that district in considerable quantities, and furnished an important
article of export.</p>

<p>The coffee-plant, which is only known on Java by its
European appellation, and its intimate connexion with European
despotism, was first introduced by the Dutch early in
the eighteenth century, and has since formed one of the articles
of their exclusive monopoly. The labour by which it is
planted, and its produce collected, is included among the
oppressions or forced services of the natives, and the delivery
of it into the government stores, among the forced deliveries
at inadequate rates. Previously to the year 1808, the cultivation
of coffee was principally confined to the <em>Súnda</em> districts.
There were but comparatively few plantations in the eastern
districts, and the produce which they were capable of yielding
did not amount to one-tenth part of the whole; but,
under the administration of Marshal Daendels, this shrub
usurped the soil destined for yielding the subsistence of the
people; every other kind of cultivation was made subservient
to it, and the withering effects of a government monopoly extended
their influence indiscriminately throughout every province
of the Island.</p>

<p>In the <em>Súnda</em> districts, each family was obliged to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Vol I Pg 139]</a></span>
care of one thousand coffee plants; and in the eastern districts,
where new and extensive plantations were now to be formed,
on soils and in situations in many instances by no means favourable
to the cultivation, five hundred plants was the prescribed
allotment. No negligence could be practised in the
execution of this duty: the whole operations of planting,
cleaning, and collecting, continued to be conducted under the
immediate superintendance of European officers, who selected
the spot on which new gardens were to be laid out, took care
that they were preserved from weeds and rank grass, and received
the produce into store when gathered.</p>

<p>A black mould intermixed with sand, is considered the best
soil for the coffee plant. In selecting a situation for the gardens,
the steep declivities of mountains, where the plant would
be endangered either by the too powerful heat of the sun or
an entire want of it, or where torrents in the rainy season
might wash away the rich earth necessary for its growth, are
avoided. The best situation for them is usually considered to
be in the vales along the foot of the high mountains, or on the
gentle declivities of the low range of hills, with which the
principal mountains are usually skirted; and it is found that,
<em>cæteris paribus</em>, the greater is the elevation of the garden, the
longer is the period of its productiveness, and the finer is the
berry.</p>

<p>Having selected a proper spot for the garden, the first operation
is to clear the ground of trees, shrubs, and the rank
grass or reeds, the latter of which, termed <em>galúga</em>, are often
found in these situations, and generally indicate a rich soil.
In clearing the ground, it is the practise to collect together
into heaps, and burn the trees, roots, and other rubbish found
on it, the ashes of which serve to enrich the soil: when the
trees are very large, the heavy labour of rooting them up is
avoided, and the trunks being cut about five feet from the
ground, are left in that state to rot, and in their gradual decay
still further to enrich the land. As soon as the ground is
thus cleared, it is levelled by three or four ploughings at short
intervals, and laid out to receive the plants. A fence is
planted round them, about twelve feet from their outer row,
generally of the <em>júrak</em>, or palma christi, intermixed with either
the <em>dádap</em>, or the silk cotton tree; and, in low situations, out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Vol I Pg 140]</a></span>side
of this a ditch is dug to carry off the water. These operations
commence in August or September, and by the time
the ground is in perfect readiness for planting, the heavy rains
are nearly over. It then only remains to select the young
plants, and prepare the <em>dádap</em> which is intended to shade
them.</p>

<p>Of the <em>dádap</em> tree there are three kinds; the <em>seráp</em>, <em>dóri</em>,
and <em>wáru</em>: but the first is preferred on account of the greater
shade it affords. It is propagated by cuttings, and in selecting
them for the coffee plantations, care is had that they are
taken from trees at least two or three years old, and that they
be three or four feet long, of which one foot at least must be
buried in the ground. After the <em>dádaps</em> are planted, holes are
dug, from a foot and a half to two feet deep, for the reception
of the coffee plant, which is then removed from the seed place
or nursery, and transplanted into the gardens.</p>

<p>In coffee gardens of four or five years old, are found quantities
of young plants, that have sprung up spontaneously from
the ripe berries dropping off the trees, and when these can be
obtained about fourteen inches long, of a strong healthy stem,
large leaves, and without branches, they are preferred to
others: but as the plants thus procured are seldom found in
sufficient quantities, nurseries for rearing them are formed as
follows: When the berries are allowed to remain on the shrub
after maturity, they become black and dry: in this state they
are plucked, and sown in seed beds lightly covered with
earth: as soon as two small leaves appear, the plants are
taken from the bed, and transplanted, about a foot asunder,
under the cover of sheds prepared for that purpose; in about
eighteen months, these plants are fit for removing into the
garden or plantation where they are destined to yield their
fruit. In taking the young plant up, the greatest care is necessary
not to injure the roots, especially the tap root, and
with this view it is generally removed with as much earth
attached to it as possible. This precaution has the additional
advantage of not too suddenly bringing the plant in contact
with a new soil.</p>

<p>The plantations are generally laid out in squares. The distance
between each plant varies according to the fertility of
the soil: in a soil not considered fertile, a distance of six feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Vol I Pg 141]</a></span>
is preserved, and in each interval is a <em>dádap</em> tree for the purpose
of affording shade; but in a rich soil, where the plant
grows more luxuriantly, fewer <em>dádaps</em> are necessary, and the
plants are placed at a greater distance from each other.</p>

<p>On Java a certain degree of shade seems necessary to the
health of the coffee-plant, especially in low situations and
during its early age; and the <em>dádap</em> is found better calculated
for affording this protection than any other shrub in the country.
It is a common saying, that where the <em>dádap</em> flourishes,
there also will flourish the coffee: but they are not always
constant or necessary companions; for in high lands many of
the most flourishing gardens are to be observed with very few
<em>dádaps</em>. The coffee tree yields fruit for a period of twenty
years, yet in the low lands it seldom attains a greater age than
nine or ten years (during six or seven of which only it may
be said to bear), and the fruit is comparatively large and
tasteless.</p>

<p>About the end of the rainy season, such coffee plants and
<em>dádaps</em> as have not thriven are replaced by others, and the
plantations cleaned: this latter operation, in gardens well
kept, is generally performed three or four times in the year:
but the tree is never cut or pruned, and is universally allowed
to grow in all its native luxuriance. In this state, it often in
favoured situations attains the height of sixteen feet, and
plants of not less than eight inches broad have frequently
been procured from the trunk. The general average produce
of a coffee-tree is not estimated at much more than a <em>káti</em>, or
a pound and a quarter English, notwithstanding some yield
from twenty to thirty <em>kátis</em>.</p>

<p>There does not appear to be any fixed or certain season
for the coffee to arrive at maturity. In the <em>Súnda</em> districts
the gathering usually commences in June or July, and it is
not till April that the whole crop is delivered into store. The
season, however, generally gives what is termed three crops;
of which the first is but small, the second the most abundant,
and the third, being what is left to ripen, may be considered
rather as a gleaning. When the berries become of a dark
crimson colour, they are plucked one by one, with the assistance
of a light <em>bámbu</em> ladder or stage, great care being taken
not to shake off the blossoms which are still on the tree, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Vol I Pg 142]</a></span>
pluck the unripe fruit. The women and children usually collect
the crop, while the husband is elsewhere engaged in
harder labour. Attached to every principal village, near
which there are coffee plantations of any extent, there is a
drying-house, to which the newly gathered coffee is brought:
it is there placed on hurdles, about four feet from the floor,
under which a slow wood fire is kept up during the night.
The roof of the drying-house is opened in the mornings and
evenings, to admit the air, and the berries are frequently
stirred to prevent fermentation. As the heat of the sun is
considered prejudicial, the roof of the house is closed during
the day. This operation is repeated till the husk is quite dry.
The berries dried in this way are small, and of a sea green or
greyish colour, and are supposed to acquire a peculiar flavour
from the smoke, although it does not appear that any particular
kind of wood is used for fuel. When dried in the sun,
the bean becomes of a pale bleached colour, is larger, specifically
lighter, and more insipid to the taste than the former.
The most common mode of freeing the bean from the husk
is, to pound the berries when dry in a bag of buffalo's hide,
great care being taken not to bruise the bean. A mill of simple
construction is sometimes used, but is not found to answer
so well. The coffee being then separated from the husk, is
put into bags or baskets, and kept on raised platforms till
the season of delivery, when it is carried down to the storehouse,
sometimes by men, but generally on the backs of buffaloes
and mares, in strings of fifteen hundred or two thousand
at a time.</p>

<p>In the <em>Súnda</em> districts there have been, for many years
past, three principal depôts for receiving the coffee from the
cultivators; viz. at <em>Buitenzorg</em>, <em>Chikàn</em>, and <em>Karang-sámbang</em>.
From <em>Buitenzorg</em> it is either sent direct to Batavia by land
in carts, or by the way of <em>Linkong</em>, whence it is forwarded in
boats by the river <em>Chi-dáni</em>. From <em>Chikàn</em> the coffee is sent
in boats down the river <em>Chi-táram</em>, and thence along the sea-coast
to Batavia. From <em>Karang-sámbang</em> it is sent down the
river <em>Chi-mánok</em> to <em>Indra-máyu</em>, where it is received into extensive
warehouses, and whence it is now generally exported
for the European market.</p>

<p>Under this system, the <em>Súnda</em> districts were estimated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Vol I Pg 143]</a></span>
afford an annual produce of one hundred thousand <em>píkuls</em> of
one hundred and thirty-three pounds and a quarter each, and
it was calculated that the young plantations in the eastern
districts, when they should come into bearing, would produce
an equal quantity; but in this latter quarter, many of the
gardens had been fixed on ill-judged spots, and the inhabitants
were averse to the new and additional burden which this
cultivation imposed upon their labour. Had the system,
therefore, even been persevered in, and enforced by a despotic
authority, it is questionable, whether the quantity anticipated
in the above estimate, or even one half of it, would have been
obtained from the eastern districts. The <em>Súndas</em> living in an
inland and mountainous country, and having been long accustomed
to the hardship of the coffee culture, are less sensible
of its pressure than the rest of their countrymen: time
and habit have reconciled them to what was at first revolting,
and what must always be considered as unjust; their modes of
life, their arts, their domestic economy, and other social habits,
have all adapted themselves to a species of labour, which
was at first forced upon them; and a state of servitude, which
the philosopher would lament as a degradation, is scarcely
felt to be a grievance by them. Instances, however, are not
wanting, in which the usual measure of exaction having been
surpassed, they have been awakened to a sense of their wretchedness.
A government of colonial monopolists, eager only for
profit, and heedless of the sources from which it was derived,
sometimes subjected its native subjects to distresses and privations,
the recital of which would shock the ear of humanity.
Suffice it to say, that the coffee culture in the <em>Súnda</em> districts
has sometimes been so severely exacted, that together with
the other constant and heavy demands made by the European
authority on the labour of the country, they deprived the unfortunate
peasants of the time necessary to rear food for their
support. Many have thus perished by famine, while others
have fled to the crags of the mountains, where raising a scanty
subsistence in patches of <em>gánga</em>, or oftener dependent for it
upon the roots of the forest, they congratulated themselves
on their escape from the reach of their oppressors. Many of
these people, with their descendants, remain in these haunts
to the present time: in their annual migrations from hill to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Vol I Pg 144]</a></span>
hill, they frequently pass over the richest lands, which still
remain uncultivated and invite their return; but they prefer
their wild independence and precarious subsistence, to the
horrors of being again subjected to forced services and forced
deliveries at inadequate rates.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say what was the recompense received by
the cultivator previous to the year 1808. The complicated
system of accounts which then prevailed, seemed only calculated
to blind the government, and to allow the European
commissary to derive an income of from eighty to one hundred
thousand dollars (25,000<em>l.</em> per annum), at the expence of the
authorities by whom he was employed, and the natives whom
he oppressed. This, in common with most of the establishments
on the island, underwent a revision in the time of Marshal
Daendels; and it was then directed, that the cultivators
should receive on delivery at the storehouses, three rix-dollars
copper for each mountain <em>píkul</em> of two hundred and twenty-five
pounds Dutch, being little more than one dollar per hundred
weight, or one half-penny per pound. This same coffee
was sometimes sold at Batavia, within fifty miles of the spot
where it was raised, at twenty Spanish dollars the hundred
weight, and has seldom been known to bring in the European
market less than eleven pence the pound. This, however,
was deemed a liberal payment by the Dutch, though in some
cases it had been transported over sixty miles of an almost impassable
country, where two men are required to carry a hundred-weight
of coffee, on their shoulders, at an expence of labour
which one would suppose at least equal to this remuneration.</p>

<p>Under the administration of the British government, the free
cultivation of coffee, in common with that of all other articles,
was permitted to the inhabitants of Bantam, <em>Chéribon</em>, and all
the eastern districts; and at the time when the island was
again ceded to the Dutch, arrangements were in progress for
extending the same provision throughout the <em>Súnda</em> districts,
under a conviction, that the quantity produced would not be
less under a system of free cultivation and free trade, than under
a system in which it was found necessary, as one of the
first acts of European authority, to compel the native princes to
direct "the total annihilation of the coffee culture within their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Vol I Pg 145]</a></span>
dominions," and to secure by treaty with them the destruction
and confiscation of all coffee found in the hands of the
natives<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. A considerable portion of the peasantry, as already
observed, have long been accustomed to the cultivation, and it
is owing to their skill and experience, as much as to any direct
superintendence or interference of the European officers (who
generally derive their information from the native chiefs, and
have little more to do, than occasionally to ride through the
garden with a pompous suite, keep the accounts, and examine
the coffee as it is received), that the coffee has so long been
furnished for the European market; the experience obtained
in the eastern districts, during the last three years, proves at
least that coercive measures are unnecessary. There are many
parts of Java, particularly the <em>Príang'en</em> regencies, where the
soil is peculiarly and eminently adapted to the cultivation;
and although it is difficult yet awhile to fix the exact rate at
which the coffee might be produced under a free system,
it may be calculated to be raised for exportation at about forty
shillings per hundred weight.</p>

<p>Of the quality of the Javan coffee, in comparison with that
of other countries, it may be observed, that during the last
years, it has invariably maintained its price in the European
market in competition with that of Bourbon, and rather exceeded
it, both of them being higher than the produce of the
West Indies. During the last years of the British administration
on Java, and after the opening of the European market
again afforded a demand, about eleven millions of young
coffee shrubs were planted out in new gardens.</p>

<p>Pepper, which at one time formed the principal export from
Java, has for some time ceased to be cultivated to any considerable
extent. It was principally raised in Bantam, and
the dependencies of that province in the southern part of
Sumatra; and in the flourishing state of the monopoly, these
districts furnished the Dutch with the chief supply for the
European market.</p>

<p>But the system by which it was procured was too oppressive
and unprincipled in its nature, and too impolitic in its
provisions, to admit of long duration. It was calculated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Vol I Pg 146]</a></span>
destroy the energies of the country, and with them, the source
from whence the fruits of this monopoly proceeded. In the
year 1811, accordingly, neither Bantam nor its dependencies
furnished the European government with one pound of this
article.</p>

<p>That pepper may be produced on Java, and supplied at a
rate equally moderate with that at which other productions
requiring similar care are furnished, cannot admit of a doubt,
and this reasonable price may be estimated at about six or
seven Spanish dollars (thirty to thirty-five shillings) the píkul.
The plant grows luxuriantly in most soils, and when once
reared requires infinitely less care and labour than coffee.
The cultivation of it on Sumatra and Prince of Wales' Island
having been so accurately and minutely described by Mr.
Marsden and Dr. Hunter, it would be unnecessary here to detail
the system followed on Java, as it is in most points the
same. The only peculiarity regarding it which may deserve
notice is, that on this island the plant is allowed to grow to a
much greater size, entwining itself round the cotton trees, frequently
to the height of fifty and sixty feet.</p>

<p>Indigo, called <em>tom</em> by the Javans, and by the <em>Súndas
tárum</em>, is general, and raised in most parts of the island.
The indigo prepared by the natives is of an indifferent quality,
and in a semifluid state, and contains much quick-lime; but
that prepared by Europeans is of very superior quality.</p>

<p>An inferior variety, denominated <em>tom-ménir</em>, having smaller
seeds, and being of quicker growth, is usually planted as a
second crop in <em>sáwahs</em>, on which one rice crop has been
raised. In these situations, the plant rises to the height of
about three feet and a half. It is then cut, and the cuttings
are repeated three, or even four times, till the ground is again
required for the annual rice crop. But the superior plant,
when cultivated on <em>tégal</em> lands, and on a naturally rich soil,
not impoverished by a previous heavy crop, rises in height
above five feet, and grows with the greatest luxuriance. The
plants intended for seeds are raised in favoured spots on the
ridges of the rice fields in the neighbourhood of the villages,
and the seed of one district is frequently exchanged for that
of another. That of the rich mountainous districts being
esteemed of best quality, is occasionally introduced into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Vol I Pg 147]</a></span>
low lands, and is thought necessary to prevent that degeneration,
which would be the consequence of cultivating for a
long time the same plant upon the same soil. In the province
of <em>Matárem</em>, where indigo is most extensively cultivated, it
is sold in the market in bundles, as low as eight-pence the
píkul weight; but in the vicinity of <em>Semárang</em>, and in districts
where it is not produced in great abundance, it bears
an advance upon this price of fifty per cent.</p>

<p>The climate, soil, and state of society on Java, seem to
offer peculiar advantages to the extensive cultivation of this
plant; and under the direction of skilful manufacturers, the
dye stuff might form a most valuable and important export
for the European market. The periodical draughts and inundations,
which confine the cultivation and manufacture in the
Bengal provinces to a few months in the year, are unknown
in Java, where the plant might, in favoured situations, be
cultivated nearly throughout the whole year, and where at
least it would be secure of a prolonged period of that kind of
weather, necessary for the cutting. The soil is superior, and
a command of water affords facilities seldom to be met with
elsewhere; while, from the tenure on which the cultivators
hold their land, and the state of society among them, advances
on account of the ensuing crop, which in Bengal form so
ruinous a part of an indigo concern, are here unnecessary,
and would be uncalled for.</p>

<p>The dye (<em>níla</em> blue) is prepared by the natives in a liquid
state, by infusing the leaves with a quantity of lime: in this
state it forms by far the principal dye of the country. Besides
the quantity of it consumed within the island, it is sometimes
exported to neighbouring countries by native traders, and
sold at the rate of from a dollar and a half to three dollars
the <em>píkul</em>, according as the plant may be in abundance or
otherwise.</p>

<p>It is impossible to form any idea of the rate at which this
species of dye can reasonably be manufactured for the European
market, from the prices paid by the Dutch, both
because the article was one of those classed by them under
the head of forced deliveries, and because the regents, who
were entrusted with its exclusive management, not fully under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Vol I Pg 148]</a></span>standing
the process of making it, conducted it always in a very
expensive way, and were frequently exposed to entire failures.</p>

<p>The cotton of the country, distinguished by the name of
<em>kápas jáwa</em>, is a variety of the gossypium herbaceum; but it
is inferior to that generally cultivated on the Indian continent,
which is also found on Java, and called by the Javans <em>kápas
múri</em>. The plant of the former differs from the latter, in
having a smaller stem, and in yielding a material, both of
coarser fibre and in less quantity. There is a third variety,
with a subarborescent stem, called <em>kápas táhon</em>, which is
very scarce. Trials remain to be made, to determine how
far the culture of the Indian cotton might be extended, so as
to supersede the Javan cotton. The inferior kind, which
forms the principal, and indeed with the mass of the people
the only material for clothing, is cultivated in almost every
part of the island. The soil, however, is not considered as
universally favourable to its growth: many of the low lands,
consisting of a clay, which bursts in the dry season, are unfit
for it; and on several of the more fertile districts, where the
plant itself flourishes, little cotton is obtained from it: the
declivities of the hills, in which the mountain rice is raised,
yield in general the best and most abundant supply. At
present, scarcely a sufficient quantity is produced on the
island to employ the female part of the inhabitants; and one
district often depends upon another for the principal part of
what it uses. The cotton of <em>Bányumás</em> is exported to <em>Bágalen</em>,
to <em>Tégal</em>, and the western parts of <em>Matárem</em>, where
it is manufactured; the environs of <em>Wong'go</em>, <em>Adi-langú</em>, and
other places towards the southern hills, supply both the
capitals in the interior; <em>Kediri</em>, <em>Pranárága</em>, and the vicinity,
likewise furnish considerable quantities for other
parts of the island. In the <em>Súnda</em> districts, the principal
supply is received from the east and west <em>Jámpang</em>. The
culture of cotton, and the manufacture of yarn, are in some
degree promoted by an ancient custom, which imposes on
every householder or village a certain contingent of cotton
yarn for the sovereign, or for the person who holds the land
on his account: this custom is called <em>panyúmpleng</em>. The
chiefs on Java, and particularly on <em>Báli</em>, frequently wear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Vol I Pg 149]</a></span>
skein of cotton yarn entwined round the handle of the kris;
a custom which sufficiently indicates the respect paid to this
species of cultivation.</p>

<p>The Javan cotton is a hardy plant, which grows to about
the height of a foot and a half. It is generally planted on the
<em>sáwahs</em> after the reaping of the rice crop, and yields the
cotton in less than three months. The Indian cotton grows
to a larger size, and produces a material of an infinitely superior
quality; but it is more delicate in its nature, must be
watched with greater care, and requires a month longer to
attain to maturity. Cotton cultivated on <em>tégal</em>, or dry land,
is considered as generally better than that raised as a second
crop on <em>sáwah</em>; and this mode of cultivation has been adduced
as the cause of the superiority ascribed to the cotton
of <em>Bâli</em>, and other more eastern islands.</p>

<p>Tobacco,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> termed by the natives <em>tombáku</em>, or <em>sáta</em>, is an
article of very general cultivation, but is only extensively
raised for exportation in the central districts of <em>Kedú</em> and
<em>Bányumás</em>: as it requires a soil of the richest mould, but at
the same time not subject to inundations, these districts hold
out peculiar advantages to the tobacco-planter, not to be
found on the low lands. For internal consumption, small
quantities are raised in convenient spots every where; but
the most eastern districts and <em>Madúra</em> are principally supplied
from <em>Púgar</em>. Bantam receives its supply from <em>Bányumás</em>,
by means of native traders from <em>Pakalúngan</em> visiting
that port in small craft. The produce of <em>Kedú</em> is conveyed
by men to <em>Semárang</em>, the great port of exportation.</p>

<p>In <em>Kedu</em> it forms, after rice, by far the most important
article of cultivation; and, in consequence of the fitness of
the soil, the plant grows to the height of from eight to ten feet,
on lands not previously dressed or manured, with a luxuriance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Vol I Pg 150]</a></span>
seldom witnessed in India. Cultivated here alternately with
rice, only one crop of either is obtained within the year; but
after the harvest of the rice, or the gathering of the tobacco-leaves,
the land is allowed to remain fallow, till the season
again arrives for preparing it to receive the other. The young
plant is not raised within the district, but procured from the
high lands in the vicinity; principally from the district of
<em>Káli-béber</em>, on the slope of the mountain <em>Díeng</em> or <em>Práhu</em>,
where it is raised and sold by the hundred to the cultivators
of the adjoining districts. The transplantation takes place
in the month of June, and the plant is at its full growth in
October.</p>

<p>Wheat has been introduced by the Europeans, and cultivated
with success to the extent required by the European
population. It thrives in many parts of the interior of the
country: it is sown in May, and reaped in October; and,
where the cultivation has been left to the Javans, the grain
has been sold at the rate of about seven rupees the <em>píkul</em>.</p>

<p>Potatoes have been cultivated during the last forty years,
in elevated situations, near all the principal European establishments,
and are reckoned of a quality superior to those ordinarily
procured in Bengal or China. Few of the natives,
however, have as yet adopted them as a common article of
food. Besides potatoes, most of the common culinary vegetables
of Europe are raised in the gardens of the Europeans
and Chinese. It must be confessed, however, that they degenerate,
if perpetuated on the soil without change; and that
their abundance and quality depends, in a great measure, on
the supplies of fresh seed imported from Europe, the Cape,
or other quarters.</p>

<p>Having now given an account of the different kinds of
produce raised within the island, and the arts of husbandry
practised by the natives, I shall conclude this short sketch of
Javan agriculture by an account of the tenure of landed property,
the rights of the proprietor and tenant, the proportion
of the produce paid for rent, the division of farms among the
inhabitants of villages, and the causes that have obstructed
or promoted agricultural improvements.</p>

<p>The relative situation, rank, and privileges of the village
farmer and the native chief in Java, correspond in most in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Vol I Pg 151]</a></span>stances,
with those of the Ryot and Zemindar of Bengal; but
the more frequent and more immediate interference of the
sovereign, in the former case, with any tendency to established
usage or prescriptive claim, has left no room for that difference
of opinion, concerning proprietary right, which exercised the
ingenuity of the highest authorities in the latter. In Bengal,
before the introduction of the permanent revenue settlement,
there were usages, institutions, and established modes of proceeding
with regard to landed estates, that rendered it doubtful
in which of the three parties more immediately interested,
the proprietary right should finally and lawfully be settled.
The claim of the Ryot to retain the land which he cultivated,
so long as he paid the stipulated contribution, seemed to raise
his character above that of an ordinary tenant removeable at
pleasure, or at the conclusion of a stipulated term. The
situation of the Zemindar, as the actual receiver of the rents,
standing between the sovereign and the cultivator, although
merely for the purpose of paying them over with certain deductions
to the sovereign, and his frequently transmitting the
office with its emoluments to his children, although held only
during pleasure, gave his character some affinity to that of an
European landholder. And lastly, the sovereign himself, who
ultimately received the rents, and regulated them at his pleasure,
and removed both Zemindar and Ryot, in case of negligence
or disobedience, was arrayed with the most essential
attributes of proprietary right, or at least exercised a power
that could render any opposite claims nugatory. Thus the
Ryot, the Zemindar, and the Sovereign, had each his pretensions
to the character of landholder. After much cautious inquiry
and deliberate discussion on the part of our Indian
government, the claims of the Zemindars, rather perhaps from
considerations of policy than a clear conviction of their superior
right, were preferred. In Java, however, except in the
cases of a few alienated lands and in the <em>Súnda</em> districts, of
which more will be said hereafter, no such pretensions are
heard of, as those which were advocated on the part of the
Zemindars of western India; although inquiries to ascertain
the equitable and legitimate rights of all classes of the people,
were known to be in progress, and a plan was declared to be
in contemplation for their permanent adjustment. From every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Vol I Pg 152]</a></span>
inquiry that was instituted under the British government, and
every fact that was presented to the view of its officers, it appeared
that, in the greatest part of the island, in the eastern
and middle districts, and in short in those provinces where
rent to any considerable amount was attainable, there existed
no proprietary right between that of the sovereign and that of
the cultivator, that the government was the only landholder.</p>

<p>There are lands, indeed, which contribute nothing to the
state, some on which the cultivator pays no rent whatever,
and others of which the rent remains in the hands of his immediate
superior; but the manner in which individuals acquire,
and the tenure by which they hold such lands, form
illustrations and proofs of the proprietary right of the sovereign.
As his resources arise almost entirely from the share
of produce which he exacts, and as he considers himself invested
with an absolute dominion over that share, he burthens
certain villages or estates with the salaries of particular officers,
allots others for the support of his relatives or favourites,
or grants them for the benefit of particular charitable or religious
institutions; in the same manner as, before the Consolidation
Act in this country, the interest of particular loans
were fixed upon the produce of specific imposts. Here the
alienation shews the original right: the sovereign renounces
the demand to which he was entitled; he makes no claim
upon the farmer for a share of the crop himself, but orders it
to be paid over to those whom he thus appoints in his place,
so far as the gift extends. With the exception of the <em>Súnda</em>
districts, as already stated, and a comparatively inconsiderable
portion of land thus alienated on different conditions,
the proprietary right to the soil in Java vests universally in
the government, whether exercised by native princes or by
colonial authority, and that permanent and hereditary interest
in it so necessary to its improvement, those individual rights
of property which are created by the laws and protected by
the government, are unknown. With these exceptions, neither
law nor usage authorizes the oldest occupant of land in
Java to consider the ground which he has reclaimed from
waste, or the farm on which he has exerted all his industry,
as his own, by such a tenure as will enable him, and his successors
for ever, to reap the fruits of his labour. He can have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Vol I Pg 153]</a></span>
gained no title, even to a definite term of occupancy, but from
the capricious servant of a capricious despot, who himself is
not legally bound by his engagement, and whose successor is
not even morally bound by it.</p>

<p>As a matter of convenience, the same cultivator may continue
to occupy the same portion of land for life, and his
children, after his decease, may inherit the ground which he
cultivated, paying the dues to which he was liable. The
head of a village, whether called <em>Búkul</em>, <em>Peting'gi</em>, or <em>Lúrah</em>,
may be continued in the collection of the village rents for
life, and may be succeeded in office by his heirs; the superior
officer, or <em>Demáng</em>, with whom he accounts, may likewise
hold his situation for a long period, and transmit it to his
family; but none of them can stand in the possession against
the will of their immediate superior, or of the sovereign, by
any claim of law or custom.</p>

<p>Little of the revenue collected from the occupants is transmitted
to the government treasury; the greatest part of that
which is raised, and which, in other countries, would come
into the hands of government, for subsequent distribution
among its servants and the support of its various establishments,
is intercepted in its progress by those to whom the
sovereign immediately assigns it. The officers of police, of
justice, of the prince's household, and, in short, public servants
of all classes, from the prime minister down to the
lowest menial, are paid with appropriations of the rent of
land.</p>

<p>To this general principle of Javan law and usage, that the
government is the only landholder, there are exceptions, as I
mentioned before, in some districts of the island. These are
chiefly in the districts inhabited by the <em>Súndas</em>, who occupy
the mountainous and woody country in the western division
of the island. Among them, private property in the soil is
generally established; the cultivator can transmit his possession
to his children: among them, it can be subdivided,
without any interference on the part of a superior; the possessor
can sell his interest in it to others, and transfer it by
gift or covenant. He pays to his chief a certain proportion
of the produce, in the same manner as the other inhabitants
of Java; because, in a country without trade or manufactures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Vol I Pg 154]</a></span>
labour or produce is the only shape in which he can contribute
to support the necessary establishments of the community.
So long as he advances this tribute, which is one-tenth
or one-fifth of the gross produce, he has an independent
right to the occupancy of his land, and the enjoyment of the
remainder. The reason why the landed tenure of these
districts differs, in so important a particular, from that of the
most extensive and valuable part of the island, may perhaps
be explained from their nature, without resorting to any
original difference in the laws of property, or the maxims of
government. Where the population is small in proportion to
the extent of soil, and much land remains unoccupied, the
best only will become the subject of demand and appropriation.
The latter alone is valuable, because it yields great
returns for little labour, and therefore offers inducements to
engage in its cultivation, in spite of many artificial disadvantages:
it alone can afford a desirable surplus, after maintaining
the hands that call for its fertility, and consequently
tempts power to reserve unalienated the right to this surplus.
On the other hand, when waste ground is to be reclaimed,
when forests or jungle are to be cleared, or when a sterile and
ungrateful spot is to be cultivated, the government have less
interest in reserving the surplus, and must offer superior
inducements of immunity, permanency, or exemption, to lead
to cultivation. On this principle, the tenure of land in the
<em>Súnda</em> districts, and on some parts of the coast, may be
accounted for. It may be concluded, that many of these
lands were reclaimed from waste by the present occupiers or
their immediate predecessors, and their rights to possess them,
which is similar to that which the discoverer of an unappropriated
field, forest, or mine would have, by nature, to as
many of their products as he could realize by his labours, has
not been crushed or interfered with by the sovereign; a forbearance,
probably, more to be attributed to motives of prudence
than to the restraint of law. Nearly coincident with
this conclusion is the supposition which assumes, that before
the introduction of the Mahomedan system, and the encroachments
of despotic sovereigns, all the lands on the island were
considered as the property of those who cultivated them; but
that, as the value of the most fertile spots became more appa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Vol I Pg 155]</a></span>rent,
while the labour which had been originally expended in
clearing them, and constituted the title to their original occupancy,
was gradually forgotten, the government found inducements
and facilities to increase its demands, and thus became
possessed of the rights of some by violence, while it rendered
those of all unworthy of being preserved. The land tenures
of the <em>Súnda</em> districts, according to this hypothesis, are only
wrecks of the general system, which have been protected
against encroachment, because they did not so powerfully
invite rapacity. Whatever truth there may be in this opinion,
the fact is undoubted, that in the mountainous and less fertile
districts of Java, and in the island of <em>Báli</em>, where the Mahomedan
sway has not yet extended, individual proprietary right
in the soil is fully established, while in that portion of Java
where the Mahomedan rule has been most felt, and where
proprietary right amounts to the greatest value, it vests
almost exclusively in the sovereign.</p>

<p>The situation, however, of the cultivator in the Sunda
districts, who is a proprietor, is not much more eligible than
that of the tenant of the government: he may, it is true,
alienate or transfer his lands, but while he retains them, he is
liable to imposts almost as great as they can bear; and when
he transfers them, he can therefore expect little for surrendering
to another the privilege of reaping from his own soil,
what is only the average recompense of labour expended on
the estate of another. The Revenue Instructions, therefore,
bearing date the 11th February 1814, and transmitted from
the local government to the officers intrusted with the charge
of the several provinces subject to its authority, lay down the
following general position: "The nature of the landed
tenure throughout the island is now thoroughly understood.
Generally speaking, no proprietary right in the soil is
vested in any between the actual cultivator and the sovereign;
the intermediate classes, who may have at any time
enjoyed the revenues of villages or districts, being deemed
merely the executive officers of government, who received
these revenues from the gift of their lord, and who depended
on his will alone for their tenure. Of this actual proprietary
right there can be no doubt that the investiture rested
solely in the sovereign; but it is equally certain, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Vol I Pg 156]</a></span>
first clearers of the land entitled themselves, as a just
reward, to such a real property in the ground they thus in a
manner created, that while a due tribute of a certain share of
its produce was granted to the sovereign power for the protection
it extended, the government, in return, was equally
bound not to disturb them or their heirs in its possession.
This disposal of the government share was thus, therefore,
all that could justly depend on the will of the ruling
authority; and consequently, the numerous gifts of land
made in various periods by the several sovereigns, have in
no way affected the rights of the actual cultivators. All
that government could alienate was merely its own revenue
or share of the produce. This subject has come fully under
discussion, and the above result, as regarding this island,
has been quite satisfactorily established." It is remarked,
in a subsequent paragraph of the same instructions, "that
there have been, it is known, in many parts of the country,
grants from the sovereign of lands in perpetuity, which are
regularly inheritable, and relative to which the original
documents still exist. Of these, some have been made for
religious purposes, others as rewards or provision for relatives
or the higher nobility. These alienations, as far
as it was justly in the power of the sovereign to make, must
certainly be held sacred; but their extent should be clearly
defined, that the rights of others be not compromised by
them. The government share, when granted, will not be
reclaimed; but the rights of the cultivator must not be
affected by these grants. Such proprietors of revenue, as
they may be termed, shall in short be allowed to act, with
regard to the cultivators on their estates, as government acts
towards those on its own lands, that is, they shall receive a
fixed share of the produce, but whilst that is duly delivered,
they shall neither exact more nor remove any individual
from his land." It is remarked by Major Yule, the British
resident, in his Report on Bantam, that there, "all property
in the soil is vested exclusively in the hands of the sovereign
power; but in consequence of its having been long customary
to confer grants of land upon the different branches
of the royal family, and other chiefs and favourites about
court, a very small portion was left without some claimant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Vol I Pg 157]</a></span>
or other. The <em>púsákas</em> granted to the relations of the
Sultan were considered as real property, and sometimes
descended to the heirs of the family, and at others were
alienated from it by private sale. To effect a transfer of
this nature, the previous sanction of the Sultan was necessary,
after which the party waited on the high priest,
or <em>Mangku-bumi</em>, who made the necessary inquiries,
and delivered the title deeds to the purchaser, in which
were specified the situation, extent, boundaries, and price
of the land sold. A register of sales was kept by the
priests, the purchaser paying the fees; and it rarely occurred
that lands sold in this manner were ever resumed by
the crown, without some adequate compensation being made
to the purchaser. <em>Púsákas</em> given to chiefs for services
performed, were recoverable again at pleasure, and always
reverted to the crown on the demise of the chief to whom
they had been granted: in all other respects, the same privileges
were annexed to them as to the former. The
holders of <em>púsáka</em> lands were very seldom the occupants;
they generally remained about the court, and on the
approach of the rice harvest deputed agents to collect
their share of the crop. They do not let their lands for
specific periods. The cultivators are liable to be turned out
at pleasure, and when ejected, have no claims to compensation
for improvements made while in possession, such
as water-courses, or plantations of fruit trees made by
themselves or their parents."</p>

<p>"We must make a distinction," say the Dutch Commissioners
appointed to investigate this subject in 1811,
"between the <em>Príangén</em> regencies, the province of <em>Chéribon</em>,
and the eastern districts. Throughout the whole extent of
the <em>Príangen</em> regencies exists a pretended property on
uncultivated lands, on which no person can settle without
the consent of the inhabitants of that <em>désa</em>, or village. In
the <em>sáwah</em> fields, or cultivated lands, every inhabitant, from
the Regent down to the lowest rank, has a share, and may
act with it in what manner he pleases, either sell, let, or
otherwise dispose of it, and loses that right only by leaving
the village in a clandestine manner.</p>

<p>"In the province of <em>Chéribon</em>, according to the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Vol I Pg 158]</a></span>
constitution, each district and <em>désa</em>, like the <em>Príangen</em> regencies,
has its own lands; with the difference, however, that
whilst those regencies are considered as belonging to villages
and individuals, here the villages and lands are altogether the
pretended property of the chiefs, or of the relations or
favourites of the Sultans, who even might dispose of the
same, with one exception, however, of that part allotted to
the common people. Sometimes the Sultans themselves
were owners of <em>désas</em> and chiefs of the same; in which
case the inhabitants were better treated than in the former
instances. If an individual thought himself wronged by the
chief, who either sold, hired out, or otherwise disposed
of his lands, he took his revenge, not on that chief, but on
the person who held possession of the property. To corroborate
this statement it may be mentioned, that the lands in
the district of <em>Chéribon</em> were for the most part farmed out
to Chinese, who increased their extortions in proportion as
the chief raised his farm or rent, and thus almost deprived
the common people of all their means.</p>

<p>"On the north-east coast of the eastern districts, no person
can be called a proprietor of rice fields or other lands: the
whole country belongs to government, and in this light do
all the Regents consider it. The rice fields of a regency
are divided among the whole of the population: in the
division the chiefs have a share, according to their rank,
occupations, or taxes they are paying.</p>

<p>"The chief enjoys his lands as long as he holds his station;
the common people for a year only, when it falls to the
share of another inhabitant of the <em>désa</em>, or village, that all
may reap a benefit from it in turn. The ideas of the Javans
concerning tenures, thus appear to be of three kinds: in
the <em>Súnda</em> division they consist in allotting to the villages
of uncultivated, and to individual persons of certain portions
in the cultivated or sáwah fields: in <em>Chéribon</em>, the sultans
and chiefs, as well as the common people, assert pretensions
to similar allotments: in the eastern districts, on the contrary,
nobody pretends to the possession of land; every
one is satisfied with the regulation laid down, but if a man's
share is withheld, he is apt to emigrate. No person considers
himself bound to servitude. The Javans, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Vol I Pg 159]</a></span>
in the <em>Príang'en</em> regencies, in <em>Chéribon</em>, and in the eastern
districts, pretend to have an unquestionable right to all
the fruit trees and <em>síri</em> plants, at or near their <em>kámpung</em>
or <em>désa</em>."</p>

<p>"There is not," says Mr. Knops, another of the Dutch
Commissioners, "a single Javan, who supposes that the soil
is the property of the Regent, but they all seem to be sensible
that it belongs to government, usually called the sovereign
among them; considering the Regent as a subject
like themselves, who holds his district and authority from
the sovereign. His idea of property is modified by the
three kinds of subjects to which it is applied: rice fields,
<em>gâgas</em>, and fruit trees. A Javan has no rice fields he can
call his own; those of which he had the use last year will
be exchanged next year for others. They circulate (as in
the regency of <em>Semárang</em>) from one person to another, and
if any one were excluded, he would infallibly emigrate. It
is different with the <em>gágas</em>, or lands where dry rice is cultivated:
the cultivator who clears such lands from trees or
brushwood, and reclaims them from a wilderness, considers
himself as proprietor of the same, and expects to reap its
fruits without diminution or deduction. With regard to fruit
trees, the Javan cultivator claims those he has planted as his
legal property, without any imposts: if a chief were to trespass
against this right, the village would soon be deserted.
The Javan, however, has not, in my opinion, any real idea
of property even in his fruit trees, but usage passes with him
for a law. All dispositions made by the chief, not contrary
to custom or the <em>ádat</em>, are considered as legal, and likewise
all that would contribute to ease the people, by lessening or
reducing the capitation tax, the contingent, the feudal services,
in short all the charges imposed upon them. A different
system would be contrary to custom. Whatever favours
the people is legal, whatever oppresses them is an
infraction of the custom."</p>

<p>The tenure of land in the native provinces is the same generally
as in the eastern districts. Thus stands the question
with regard to the proprietary right to the soil in Java; but
it is of more consequence in an agricultural point of view, and
consequently more to my present purpose, to inquire how that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Vol I Pg 160]</a></span>
right is generally exercised, than in whom it resides. Though
the cultivator had no legal title to his lands, there might still
be such a prevalent usage in favour of his perpetual occupancy,
as would secure him in the enjoyment of his possession, and
enable him to reap the fruits of his industry equally with the
protection of his positive law.</p>

<p>But unfortunately for the prosperity of the people, this was
far from being generally the case. The cultivator had little
security for continued occupancy, but the power, on his part,
of enduring unlimited oppression without removing from under
it, or the interest of his immediate superior in retaining a
useful slave; and as he could not expect to reap in safety the
fruits of his industry, beyond the bare supply of his necessities,
he carried that industry no farther than his necessities
demanded. The sovereign knew little about the state of his
tenantry or the conduct of his agents, and viewed the former
only as instruments to create the resources, which the latter
were employed to collect or administer. All his care was to
procure as much from the produce of the soil and industry of
his subjects as possible, and the complaints of the people, who
suffered under the exactions of these chiefs, were intercepted
on their way to the throne, and perhaps would have been disregarded
had they reached it. The sovereign delegates his
authority over a province of greater or less extent, to a high
officer called <em>Adipáti</em>, <em>Tumúng'gung</em>, or <em>Ang'ebái</em>, who is himself
paid by the rent of certain portions of land, and is responsible
for the revenues of the districts over which he is appointed.
He, in his turn, elects an officer, called <em>Demáng</em> or
<em>Mántridésa</em>, to administer the subdivisions or districts of the
province, to appoint the chiefs, and to collect the rents of several
villages. The village chief, <em>Búkul</em>, <em>Lúrah</em>, or whatever
designation he bears in the different parts of the island, thus
appointed by his immediate superior, is placed in the administration
of the village, required to collect the government share
of the crop from the cultivator, and to account for it to the <em>Demáng</em>.
In some provinces, the village elects its own chief,
called <em>Petíng'gi</em>, who exercises similar functions with the
<em>Búkul</em> appointed by government, as will be afterwards more
particularly observed in the account of the native administration.
As all the officers of government, of whatever rank, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Vol I Pg 161]</a></span>
paid their salaries in the produce of the land, the <em>Búkuls</em> and
the <em>Demángs</em> become responsible for the share of the appropriations
of villages to this account, as much as if it went into
the government treasury. They are themselves paid by the
reservation of a certain share of what they collect, and of
course are always ready to please their employers, and to increase
their own emoluments, by enforcing every practicable
exaction. Every officer has unlimited power over those below
him, and is himself subject to the capricious will of the
sovereign or his minister. When the Regent makes any new
or exorbitant demand upon those whom he immediately superintends,
they must exact it with an increased degree of
rigor over the chiefs of villages, who are thus, in their turn,
forced to press upon the cultivator, with the accumulated
weight of various gradations of despotism.</p>

<p>The <em>Búkul</em>, or the <em>Petíng'gi</em> is the immediate head of the
village, and however much his authority is modified in particular
districts, has always extensive powers. To the cultivators,
he appears in the character of the real landholder, as
they have no occasion to look beyond him to the superior, by
whom he is controlled. He distributes the lands to the different
cultivators on such shares, and in such conditions, as
he pleases, or as custom warrants, assesses the rents they have
to pay, allots them their village duties, measures the produce
of their fields, and receives the government proportion. He
sometimes himself cultivates a small portion of land, and in so
far is regarded only as a tenant, like the rest of the villagers.
He is accountable for all the collections he realizes, with the
reservation of a fifth part for his trouble, which share must be
viewed merely as the emoluments of office, and not as the
rent of the landlord, or the profits of a farmer. He sometimes
holds his situation immediately of the sovereign, or by the
election of the cultivators; but more generally from the intermediate
agent of government, whom I have mentioned
above, to whom he is accountable for his receipts. By his
superior he may be removed at pleasure; although the local
knowledge and accumulated means, which are the consequence
of the possession of office, generally insure its duration
to his person for a considerable period, or as long as his
superior himself retains his power.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Vol I Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>The lands which he superintends and apportions range from
six or seven to double that number of <em>jungs</em>, or from forty or
fifty to an hundred acres English, and these are divided
among the inhabitants of his village, generally varying from
about two acres to half an acre each. That this minute division
of land takes place, may be shewn from the surveys made
under the British government in the eastern provinces, which
nearly resemble those under the dominion of the native princes,
and consequently may be taken as indicating the general state
of the island. The inhabitants in the agricultural districts of
the residency of <em>Surabáya</em> amount in all to 129,938: these
compose 33,141 families, of which 32,618 belong to the class
of cultivators, and 523 belonging to other professions pay only
a ground rent for their houses. The area of the province contains
about twelve hundred square miles, or 34,955 <em>jungs</em>,
about 20,000 only of which are cultivated, so as to become of
any consequence in the division of lands among the villages,
the number of which amount to 2,770. By a calculation
founded on these data, it would appear, that each village
averages about twelve families, that a family falls considerably
short of the average of four, and that a little more than seven
<em>jungs</em> are allotted to a village. In <em>Kedú</em> the population
amounts to 197,310, the number of villages to 3879, and the
quantity of cultivated land to 19,052 <em>jungs</em>; so that in this
province there are about five <em>jungs</em> attached to a village; and
a village is inhabited by fifty-one souls, or about twelve or
thirteen families. In <em>Grésik</em>, the number of villages amount
to 1396, the quantity of cultivated land to 17,018 <em>jungs</em>, and
the population to 115,442 souls. In <em>Probalíng'o</em> and <em>Besúki</em>,
the numbers are​&mdash;of inhabitants, 104,359; of villages, 827;
of cultivated land, 13,432 <em>jungs</em>. In these two last the proportions
vary, the number of <em>jungs</em> to a village in the former
being more than twelve, and of inhabitants more than eighty,
or about twenty families; and in the latter, the proportion is
more than one hundred and twenty souls to a village possessed
of more than sixteen <em>jungs</em> of land. It would be superfluous
to state any more examples. In different parts of
the island, there are variations within certain limits; but the
quantity of land occupied by one cultivator seldom exceeds a
<em>báhu</em>, (or the quarter of a <em>jung</em>), although the quantity occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Vol I Pg 163]</a></span>
by a village, as will be seen by the above instances, varies from
five to sixteen, according to the extent of the population.</p>

<p>The land allotted to each separate cultivator is managed by
himself exclusively; and the practice of labouring in common,
which is usual among the inhabitants of the same village
on continental India, is here unknown. Every one,
generally speaking, has his own field, his own plough, his
own buffaloes or oxen; prepares his farm with his own hand,
or the assistance of his family at seed-time, and reaps it by
the same means at harvest. By the recent surveys, when
every thing concerning the wealth and the resources of the
country became the subject of inquiry, and means were employed
to obtain the most accurate information, it was ascertained,
that the number of buffaloes on that part of the island
to which these surveys extended, was nearly in the proportion
of one to a family, or a pair to two families; and that, including
the yokes of oxen, which are to those of buffaloes as one
to three, this proportion would be very much exceeded. In
some provinces, more exclusively devoted to grain cultivation,
the number of ploughs, and of course oxen or buffaloes,
nearly amounts to one to a family. In other cases, where
they fall much short of this proportion, a considerable part of
the inhabitants must be engaged in labours unconnected with
agriculture, or the cultivators must be engaged in rearing
produce, where the assistance of those animals is not required.
Thus in <em>Japára</em> and <em>Jawána</em>, where the number of inhabitants
is 103,290, or about twenty-six thousand families, the number
of ploughs amount to 20,730, and of buffaloes to 43,511;
while in the Batavian Regencies, where the coffee culture
employs a considerable part of the inhabitants, the number of
families is about sixty thousand, and of ploughs only 17,366.
The lands on Java are so minutely divided among the inhabitants
of the villages, that each receives just as much as can
maintain his family and employ his individual industry.</p>

<p>But situated as the Javan peasantry are, there is but little
inducement to invest capital in agriculture, and much labour
must be unprofitably wasted: as property is insecure, there
can be no desire of accumulation; as food is easily procured,
there can be no necessity for vigorous labour. There exists,
as a consequence of this state of nature and of the laws, few
examples of great affluence or abject distress among the peasantry;
no rich men, and no common beggars. Under the
native governments and the Regents of the Dutch Company,
there were no written leases or engagements binding for a
term of years; nor could such contracts well be expected to
be formed with an officer, who held his own place by so unstable
a tenure as the will of a despot. The cultivator bargained
with the <em>Búkul</em> or <em>Petíng'gi</em> for a season or for two
crops, had his land measured off by the latter, and paid a
stipulated portion of the produce either in money or in kind.
When the crop had arrived at maturity, the cultivator, if his
engagement was for so much of the produce in kind, cut
down his own share, and left that of the landlord on the
ground.</p>

<p>The proportion of the crop paid as rent varied with the
kind of land, or produce, and the labour employed by the
cultivator. In the <em>sáwah</em> lands, the share demanded by the
landlord rarely exceeded one-half, and might fall as low as
one-fourth, according as the quality of the soil was good or
bad, or the labour employed in irrigating or otherwise preparing
it was greater or less. In <em>tégal</em> lands, the rent paid
varied from one-third to one-fifth of the produce; a diminution
to be attributed to the uncertainty of the crop, and the
necessity of employing more labour to realize an equal produce
than on the other species of cultivation. In cases where
there was a second crop of less value than the principal rice
or maize crop, no additional demand was made upon the
additional grain reaped by the farmer.</p>

<p>If such rates had been equitably fixed, after a deliberate
estimate of the proportion between the labour of the cultivator
and his produce, and if from the best kind of <em>sáwah</em> no more
than the half had been required, with a scale of rents diminishing
as labour increased or the soil deteriorated, the peasant
could have had no reason to complain of the exactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Vol I Pg 165]</a></span>
of government A <em>jung</em> of the best <em>sáwah</em> lands will produce
between forty and fifty <em>ámats</em> of <em>pári</em>, each <em>ámat</em> weighing
about one thousand pounds. Suppose a cultivator occupied a
quarter of a <em>jung</em> of such land, he would reap ten <em>ámats</em>, or
ten thousand pounds of <em>pári</em>, and allowing a half for the government
deduction, would still retain five thousand pounds,
which is equal to about eight quarters of wheat. The best
<em>sáwah</em> lands return about forty-fold; <em>sáwah</em> lands of the second
quality yield from thirty to forty <em>ámats</em> the <em>jung</em>; and
they are considered of inferior quality when they yield less
than thirty. From these last, two-fifths or one-third was required
as the landlord's share. <em>Tégal</em> lands were assessed at
one-third, one fourth, or one-fifth of their produce, according
to their quality, and their produce in value is about a fourth
of <em>sáwah</em> lands of the same relative degree in the scale. In
Bengal, according to Mr. Colebrooke's excellent account of
its husbandry, "the landlord's proportion of the crop was
one-half, two-fifths, and a third, according to the difference
of circumstances." The value in money of a crop of rice
grown on a <em>jung</em> of the best land under the wet cultivation,
may amount to one hundred and sixty Spanish dollars; and
on a <em>báhu</em> (the space occupied by an individual cultivator),
forty dollars. I formerly stated the price of the implements
of husbandry, the price of buffaloes or oxen, the expence of
building a house, and providing it with the necessary furniture.
The whole farming stock of a villager may be purchased
for about fifteen or sixteen dollars, or for little more than a
third part of the produce of his land in one year. The price
of labour, the price of cattle and of grain, as well as the fertility
of the soil, varies in different parts of the island; but,
in general, it may be laid down as an indisputable proposition,
that from the natural bounty of the soil, the peasantry
might derive all the means of subsistence and comfort, without
any great exertion of ingenuity, or any severity of toil, if
their government made no greater demand than the shares
stated above.</p>

<p>But besides the rent which the cultivator paid for his land,
he was liable to many more grievous burdens. The great
objection to a tax levied on land, and consisting in a certain
share of its produce, arises from the effect that it has in ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Vol I Pg 166]</a></span>structing
improvements; but there were other imposts and
contributions exacted from the peasantry, which were positively
and immediately oppressive. A ground-rent for houses,
called <em>pachúmplang</em>, was prevalent over many parts of the
island, amounting in the provinces subject to the native
princes, to one-sixth or seventh of a dollar for each dwelling
or cottage. The cultivator, in some parts of the country, instead
of paying this tax, was obliged to pay for his fruit trees.
In some districts there was a capitation tax; arbitrary fines
were levied in others, and contributions on the birth or marriage
of the children of the superior, regent, or the prince.
There were several charges made on the villages, that had a
more immediate reference to their own advantage, but which
nevertheless were felt as burdens; such as contributions for
the repair of roads, of bridges, for the making or repair of
water-courses, dams, and other works necessary for irrigation.
Demands on the inhabitants for charitable and religious objects
or institutions are universal, though not very oppressive.
Every village has its priest, who depends upon the contributions
of the peasantry for his support, receiving so much rice
or <em>pári</em> as his salary. The taxes on the internal trade of the
country extended to every article of manufacture, produce, or
consumption, and being invariably farmed out to Chinese,
who employed every mode of extortion that their ingenuity
could invent, or the passive disposition of the people would
allow them to practice, constituted an inexhaustible source of
oppression: to these we may add the feudal services and
forced deliveries required under the Dutch government.</p>

<p>The following observations extracted from two reports, the
one on <em>Bantam</em>, at the western side of the island, and the
other on <em>Pasúruan</em>, almost at its other extremity, were unhappily
by no means inapplicable to the greatest part of the
intermediate space, and contain by no means an exaggerated
representation. "The holders of <em>púsaka</em> lands in <em>Bantam</em>
were very seldom the occupants; they generally remained
about court, and on the approach of the <em>pári</em> harvest deputed
agents to collect their share of the crop. But what
proportion their share would bear to the whole produce
does not appear to be well defined: it is by one stated
at a fifth, and by some (which I suspect to be nearest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Vol I Pg 167]</a></span>
truth) at as much as the cultivator could afford to pay, the
agents of the proprietors being the judges of the quantity.
The proprietors of the <em>púsakas</em> have also a claim to the
services of the cultivators: a certain number of them are
always in attendance at the houses of their chiefs, and on
journies are employed in carrying their persons and baggage.
The lands not <em>púsaka</em> used to pay the same proportion
of produce to the Sultan as the others did to the proprietors;
but the cultivators of the royal dominions laboured
under greater disadvantages than the others. Every chief
or favourite about court had authority to employ them in
the most menial offices; and chiefs possessing <em>púsakas</em>,
often spared their own people and employed the others.
The Sultan always had a right to enforce the culture of any
article which he thought proper to direct; and, in such
cases, a price was paid upon the produce, which was
generally very inadequate to the expences."</p>

<p>"It may be very desirable," says Mr. Jourdan, in his report
on the completion of the settlement of <em>Pasúruan</em>, "that
I should mention a few of the oppressions from which it is
the object of the present system to relieve the people. I
cannot but consider the greatest of these, the extent of the
personal service demanded, not only by the <em>Tumúng'gung</em>
and his family, but the <em>Mántris</em> and all the petty chiefs,
who had trains of followers that received no stipendiary recompence.
These added to the individuals employed in the
coffee plantations (to which they appear peculiarly averse),
in beating out the rice for the contingent, in cutting grass
for and attending the <em>jáyang sekárs</em>, post carriage and letter-carriers,
may be calculated to have employed one-fifth of
the male population of the working men. Another great
source of exaction was the large unwieldy establishment of
<em>jáyang sekárs</em>, and police officers: the former were liberally
paid, the latter had no regular emoluments. Both these
classes, however, quartered themselves freely in whatever
part of the country their functions demanded their attendance.
This was equally the case with any of the Regent's
family or petty chiefs who travelled for pleasure or on duty.
Whatever was required for themselves and their followers,
was taken from the poor inhabitants, who have now been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Vol I Pg 168]</a></span>
long accustomed to such practices, that they never dare to
complain or to remonstrate. The European authority did
not escape the taint of corruption. Monopolies, unpaid
services, licences, forced or at least expected presents, were
but too common even in the best times, and must have contributed
to estrange the affections and respect of the natives
from that power which should have afforded them protection.
From this faint sketch it will be deduced, that while
the men of rank were living in pampered luxury, the poor
provincials were suffering penury and distress."</p>

<p>The Dutch Company, actuated solely by the spirit of gain,
and viewing their Javan subjects with less regard or consideration
than a West-India planter formerly viewed the gang
upon his estate, because the latter had paid the purchase
money of human property which the other had not, employed
all the pre-existing machinery of despotism, to squeeze
from the people their utmost mite of contribution, the last
dregs of their labour, and thus aggravated the evils of a capricious
and semi-barbarous government, by working it with all
the practised ingenuity of politicians, and all the monopolizing
selfishness of traders.</p>

<p>Can it therefore be a subject of surprize, that the arts of
agriculture and the improvement of society, have made no
greater advances in Java? Need it excite wonder, that the
implements of husbandry are simple; that the cultivation is
unskilful and inartificial; that the state of the roads, where
European convenience is not consulted, is bad; that the natural
advantages of the country are neglected; that so little
enterprize is displayed or capital employed; that the peasant's
cottage is mean, and that so little wealth and knowledge
are among the agricultural population; when it is considered,
that the occupant of land enjoys no security for
reaping the fruits of his industry; when his possession is
liable to be taken away from him every season, or to suffer
such an enhancement of rent as will drive him from it; when
such a small quantity of land only is allowed him as will yield
him bare subsistence, and every ear of grain that can be
spared from the supply of his immediate wants, is extorted
from him in the shape of tribute; when his personal services
are required unpaid for, in the train of luxury or in the cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Vol I Pg 169]</a></span>ture
of articles of monopoly; and when, in addition to all
these discouragements, he is subject to other heavy imposts
and impolitic restraints? No man will exert himself, when
acting for another, with so much zeal as when stimulated by
his own immediate interest; and under a system of government,
where every thing but the bare means of subsistence is
liable to be seized, nothing but the means of subsistence will
be sought to be attained. The Dutch accuse the Javans of
indolent habits and fraudulent dispositions; but surely the
oppressor has no right to be surprized, that the oppressed
appear reluctant in his service, that they meet his exactions
with evasion, and answer his call to labour with sluggish indifference.</p>

<p>The mode of dividing land into minute portions is decidedly
favourable to population, and nothing but those checks to the
progress of agriculture, to which I have referred, could have
limited the population of Java to numbers so disproportioned
to its fertility, or confined the labours of the peasantry to so
small a space of what would reward their industry with abundance.
The cultivated ground on the Island has already been
estimated at an eighth part of the whole area. In <em>Probolíng'o</em>
and <em>Besúki</em>, the total number of <em>jungs</em> of land amount to
775,483, the total of land capable of superior cultivation
174,675 <em>jungs</em>, while the space actually cultivated amounts
only to 13,432 <em>jungs</em>. In <em>Rembáng</em>, the land belonging to
villages is about 40,000 <em>jungs</em>, and not the half of that quantity
is under cultivation. In <em>Pasúruan</em>, the same appearances
are exhibited. From this last district the Resident's report on
the settlement states, as a reason for his assessing the same
rent on all the land, "that the cultivated part bearing so
small a proportion to the uncultivated, the inhabitants have
been enabled to select the most fruitful spots exclusively:
hence arises the little variety I have discovered in the produce."
<em>Chéribon</em>, Bantam, the <em>Priang'en</em> regencies, the
eastern corner of the Island, the provinces under the native
governments, and in short the greatest and most fertile districts,
furnish striking illustrations of this disproportion between
the bounty of nature and the inefficient exertions of
man to render her gifts available, to extend population, and to
promote human happiness; or rather they supply an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Vol I Pg 170]</a></span>
of unwise institutions and despotic government, counteracting
the natural progress of both.</p>

<p>When the British arms prevailed in 1811, the attention of
government was immediately turned to the state and interests
of its new subjects. It saw at once the natural advantages of
the Island and the causes which obstructed its prosperity,
and it determined to effect those changes which, having succeeded
in Western India, and being sanctioned by justice and
expediency, were likely to improve those advantages and to
remove those obstructions. In consequence of the instructions
of Lord Minto, the Governor-General, who was present at the
conquest, and took a great interest in the settlement of the
Island, no time was lost to institute inquiries and to collect
information on the state of the peasantry, and the other points,
the knowledge of which was necessary, before any attempt to
legislate could be wisely or rationally made. The following
principles, laid down by his Lordship, were those on which
the local government acted.</p>

<p>"Contingents of rice, and indeed of other productions, have
been hitherto required of the cultivators by government at
an arbitrary rate: this also is a vicious system, to be abandoned
as soon as possible. The system of contingents did
not arise from the mere solicitude for the supply of the people,
but was a measure alone of finance and control, to
enable government to derive a revenue from a high price
imposed on the consumer, and to keep the whole body of
the people dependent on its pleasure for subsistence. I recommend
a radical reform in this branch to the serious and
early attention of government. The principle of encouraging
industry in the cultivation and improvements of lands,
by creating an interest in the effort and fruits of that industry,
can be expected in Java only by a fundamental change
of the whole system of landed property and tenure. A wide
field, but a somewhat distant one, is open to this great and
interesting improvement; the discussion of the subject,
however, must necessarily be delayed till the investigation
it requires is more complete. I shall transmit such thoughts
as I have entertained, and such hopes as I have indulged
in this grand object of amelioration; but I am to request
the aid of all the information, and all the lights, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Vol I Pg 171]</a></span>
Island can afford. On this branch, nothing must be done
that is not mature, because the exchange is too extensive
to be suddenly or ignorantly attempted. But fixed and immutable
principles of the human character and of human
association, assure me of ultimate, and I hope not remote
success, in views that are consonant with every motive of
action that operate on man, and are justified by the practice
and experience of every flourishing country of the world."</p>

<p>In compliance with these instructions, the object of which
was embraced with zeal by the local government, to whom his
lordship entrusted the administration of the Island, a commission
was appointed, under the able direction of Colonel
Mackenzie, to prosecute statistic inquiries; the results of
which, as corrected and extended by subsequent surveys, will
frequently appear in the tables and statistic accounts of this
work. The nature of the landed tenure, and the demand
made upon agriculture, in all the shapes of rent and taxes,
were ascertained; the extortions practised by the Dutch
officers, the native princes, the regents, and the Chinese, were
disclosed; the rights of all classes, by law or usage, investigated;
the state of the population, the quantity and value of
cultivated land, of forests, of plantations of cotton and coffee,
the quantity of live stock, and other resources of the country
subject to colonial administration, inquired into and made
known. The result of these inquiries, with regard to landed
tenure, I have given above; and, as it will be seen, it was
such as opposed the rights of no intermediate class between
the local government and the beneficial changes it contemplated
in behalf of the great body of the people. After attaining
the requisite information, the course which expediency,
justice, and political wisdom pointed out was not doubtful,
and coincided (as in most cases it will be found to do) with
the track which enlightened benevolence, and a zealous desire
to promote the happiness of the people would dictate.</p>

<p>The peasant was subject to gross oppression and undefined
exaction: our object was to remove his oppressor, and to limit
demand to a fixed and reasonable rate of contribution. He
was liable to restraints on the freedom of inland trade, to personal
services and forced contingents: our object was to commute
them all for a fixed and well-known contribution. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Vol I Pg 172]</a></span>
exertions of his industry were reluctant and languid, because
he had little or no interest in its fruits: our object was to encourage
that industry, by connecting its exertions with the
promotion of his own individual welfare and prosperity. Capital
could not be immediately created, nor agricultural skill
acquired; but by giving the cultivator a security, that whatever
he accumulated would be for his own benefit, and whatever
improvement he made, he or his family might enjoy it, a
motive was held out to him to exert himself in the road to
attain both. Leases, or contracts for fixed rents for terms of
years, in the commencement, and eventually in perpetuity,
seemed to be the only mode of satisfying the cultivator, that
he would not be liable, as formerly, to yearly undefined demands;
while freedom from all taxes but an assessment on his
crop, or rather a fixed sum in commutation thereof, would
leave him at full liberty to devote the whole of his attention
and labour to render his land as productive as possible.</p>

<p>In conformity with these views, an entire revolution was effected
in the mode of levying the revenue, and assessing the
taxes upon agriculture. The foundation of the amended system
was, 1st. The entire abolition of forced deliveries at
inadequate rates, and of all feudal services, with the establishment
of a perfect freedom in cultivation and trade: 2d.
The assumption, on the part of government, of the immediate
superintendence of the lands, with the collection of the resources
and rents thereof: 3d. The renting out of the lands so
assumed to the actual occupants, in large or small estates, according
to local circumstances, on leases for a moderate term.
In the course of the following years (1814 and 1815) these
measures were carried into execution in most of the districts
under our government, with a view to the eventual establishment
of a perpetual settlement, on the principle of the <em>ryotwar</em>,
or as it has been termed on Java, the <em>tiáng-álit</em> system.</p>

<p>The principles of land rental and detailed settlement were
few and simple<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. After mature inquiry, no obstacle appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Vol I Pg 173]</a></span>to exist, either in law or usage, to the interference of government,
in regulating the condition of the peasantry; and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Vol I Pg 174]</a></span>resolved, therefore, that it should take into its own hands the
management of that share of the land produce which was allowed
to be its due, and protect the cultivator in the enjoyment
and free disposal of the remainder. The undue power
of the chiefs was to be removed, and so far as they had a
claim for support, founded either on former services or deprivation
of expected employment, they were to be remunerated
in another way. The lands, after being surveyed and estimated,
were to be parcelled out among the inhabitants of the
villages, in the proportions established by custom or recommended
by expediency. Contracts were to be entered into
with each individual cultivator, who was to become the tenant
of government, and leases specifying the extent and situation
of their land, with the conditions of their tenure, were to be
granted for one or more years, with a view to permanency, if
at the end of the stipulated term, the arrangement should be
found to combine the interest of the public revenue with the
welfare and increasing prosperity of the occupant. If that
was not the case, room was thus left for a new adjustment,
for a reduction of rate, or for any change in the system which
might adapt it more to the interests and wishes of the people,
without prejudice to the rights of government.</p>

<p>This experiment hazarded nothing, and held out every
prospect of success; it committed no injustice, and compromised
no claim. The peasantry could not suffer, because an
assessment less in amount, and levied in a less oppressive
manner than formerly (all rents, taxes, and services included),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Vol I Pg 175]</a></span>was required of them: the chiefs could not complain, because
they were allowed the fair emoluments of office, and only restrained
from oppressions which did not so much benefit
themselves as injure their inferiors. Most of the latter were
not only allowed an equivalent for their former income, but
employed in services allied to their former duties,​&mdash;the collection
of the revenue, and the superintendence of the police.
As the cultivator had acquired rights which the chief could
not violate, as the former held in his possession a lease with
the conditions on which he cultivated his farm, no infringement
of which could be attempted on the part of the latter
with impunity, no evil could result from employing the chiefs
in collecting the revenue of districts, while, from their practical
knowledge of the habits and individual concerns of the peasantry,
of the nature of the seasons and the crops, they were
the fittest persons for the office. For these services it seemed
most expedient to pay them, either by allowing them a certain
percentage on their collections, or by allotting them portions
of land rent free. The village constitution (which will be
more particularly noticed in treating of the institutions of the
country) was preserved inviolate; and the chiefs or head men
of the villages, in many instances elected by the free will of
the villagers, were invariably continued in office as the immediate
collectors of the rents, and with sufficient authority to
preserve the police, and adjust the petty disputes that might
arise within them; the government scrupulously avoiding all
unnecessary interference in the customs, usages, and details of
these societies.</p>

<p>In looking at the condition of the peasantry, and in estimating
the fertility of the soil, the wants of the people, and the
proportion of produce and industry that they formerly were
accustomed to pay for supporting the establishments of government,
it was thought reasonable to commute all former
burdens into a land rent on a fixed principle; all <em>sáwah</em> lands
being estimated by the <em>pári</em>, or unhusked rice, they could
produce, and all <em>tégal</em> lands by their produce in maize. The
following (as stated in the eighty-third article of the Revenue
Instructions) was considered as the fairest scale for fixing the
government share, and directed to be referred to, as much as
possible, as the general standard:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Vol I Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Government," it is said in the eighty-fifth section,
"think it necessary to declare explicitly, that they will be
satisfied when the land revenue shall be productive to them
in these proportions, determining at no future period to
raise the scale; so that the inhabitants, being thus exactly
acquainted with what will form the utmost demand on
them, and resting in full confidence that government will
not exact any thing further, may in that security enjoy their
possessions in undisturbed happiness, and apply their utmost
industry to the improvement of their lands; assured
that, while they conduct themselves well, that land will
never be taken from them, and that the more productive they
can render it, the more beneficial it will be for themselves."</p>

<p>The government share might either be received in money or
in kind from the <em>sáwah</em> lands; but the <em>tégal</em> produce, though
estimated in maize, was always, if possible, to be commuted
into money at the lowest price in the market; and as cultivators
generally held portions of both, this rule, it was conceived,
could not be considered generally as a hardship.</p>

<p>In the first settlement, leases were only granted for a year,
or at the utmost three years, and were given to intermediate
renters; but in the more detailed settlement of 1814, after
sufficient information had been collected on the state of the
country, government determined to act directly with the individual
cultivator, and to lay the foundation of a permanent
system. By this latter period, the experiments have been
tried to a certain extent, and had succeeded beyond the most
sanguine expectation. Difficulties met us in the way, but
they were by no means insurmountable; there were at first
imperfections in the system, but they did not affect its prin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Vol I Pg 177]</a></span>ciple,
and were easily removed. By the zeal, the ability, and
industry of the various officers entrusted with the execution
of the duty, whatever was practicable in furtherance of the
object in which they felt deeply interested, was accomplished.
In the course of the years 1814 and 1815, the new system
was introduced into <em>Bantam</em>, <em>Chéribon</em>, and the eastern
districts, over a population of a million and a half of cultivators,
not only without disturbance and opposition, but to
the satisfaction of all classes of the natives, and to the
manifest increase of the public revenue derivable from land.
In several journies which I undertook into the different
provinces, for the purposes of examining in person the effect
of the progressive system of reform which I had the happiness
to introduce, and of lending the sanction of official
authority to such modifications of it as local circumstances
might render advisable, I was a pleased spectator of its beneficial
tendency, and of the security and satisfaction it universally
diffused. The cultivator, protected against all vexatious
exactions, and no longer at the beck of a tyrannical chief
who made unlimited demands upon his personal services, was
beginning to feel additional stimulants to his industry, to
acquire a superior relish for property, and to acknowledge
that government and power were not always the enemies of
the lower ranks of society, or as they modestly call themselves,
<em>the little people (tiang-halit)</em>. The British administration
of Java, with all its agents, having watched the
progress of the amended system at first with vigilant anxiety,
at last saw it nearly completed with success, and rejoiced in
its beneficial operation on the prosperity, improvement, and
happiness of the people. During the two years that we
retained possession of the island, after the greatest part of its
arrangements were carried into effect, we had daily proofs of
the amelioration they were producing. The cultivation was
extending, the influence of the chiefs appeared to be progressively
weakening, and the number of crimes, both from
the superior industry of the people now become interested in
the result of their labours, and from the contented tranquillity
produced by an increase of the means of subsistence, as well
as from the amended system of police (mentioned in another
part of this work), was gradually diminishing. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Vol I Pg 178]</a></span>
troubling the reader with further details, I may mention that,
in the beginning of December 1815, a few months before I
left the island, not satisfied with my own observation or the
vague report of others, I circulated specific queries to the
different residents, on the comparative state of cultivation in
the different provinces, before the introduction of the detailed
settlement, and at the latest date to which an answer could
be returned, and on the comparative number of crimes at the
same two periods, and the return was as gratifying to humanity
and benevolence as it was corroborative of the opinions
previously formed. I shall quote a few extracts from these
reports. The Resident at <em>Chéribon</em> "cannot, from certain
data, tell what progress has been made in extending the
cultivation of that province, but thinks it has been considerable;"
and adds, "I have no doubt but that a few
years of the amended system of government would render
the district of <em>Chéribon</em>, so notorious for crimes, one of the
most flourishing and valuable in any part of the island."
The Resident of <em>Tégal</em> is nearly in similar circumstances
with regard to authentic documents, but gives a very favourable
opinion, both with regard to the increase of industry and
the reduction of crimes. The return from <em>Kedú</em> is more
definite: it states a positive increase of <em>tégal</em> land to the
amount of thirty-six <em>jungs</em>, but a much greater increase of
produce from improved culture. The revenue afforded a
sufficient proof of the latter fact. The same favourable
account is given of the state of police and the diminution of
crime. No data are given in the report from <em>Pakaláng'an</em> to
ascertain the additional quantity of rice lands brought into
cultivation; but an opinion is expressed, that it has increased;
and an assurance is afforded, that the culture of
indigo and tobacco has sensibly extended. As an evidence
that the means of subsistence are raised in greater abundance
than formerly, their price has very considerably diminished.</p>

<p>A commission which was appointed to inquire into the
state of the revenue, report from <em>Japára</em> the great facility
there was in collecting the revenue under the amended
system, and certify its beneficial effects in extending cultivation,
securing tranquillity, promoting industry, and
diminishing crimes. The same commission conclude their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Vol I Pg 179]</a></span>
report of <em>Grésik</em> with similar assurances of the happy results
of the revenue, and judicial arrangements for the prosperity
of that province. The Resident of <em>Rembáng</em> gives an increase
of cultivation of fifty-two <em>jungs</em> of <em>sáwah</em> and about
thirteen of <em>tégal</em> land, and accounts for the smallness of this
increase from the comparative sterility of the soil, and the
precarious supply of water. Indigo had not increased, but
tobacco had to a great degree. The vigilance of the police,
and the ameliorating effects of the revenue settlement, are
seen, it is said, in the improved state of morals. In <em>Surabáya</em>
it is stated, that during the time the amended system had
been in action, there had been an increase of three hundred
and twenty government <em>jungs</em>, making upwards of two thousand
English acres. In the residency of <em>Pasúruan</em> there is
an increase of cultivation to the amount of three hundred and
six <em>jungs</em>: this, however, does not comprehend the whole
advantage that the new system produced in that province, for
industry had been so much promoted by it, as to obtain two
crops within the year, on many of the lands where the
cultivator was formerly content with one. It is needless to
enter into any further particulars, to shew the advantages of
the regulations adopted with regard to the settlement of the
landed revenue.</p>

<p>By a steady adherence to a system which, even in its
origin, was productive of such fruits, by continuing to the
peasant the protection of laws made for his benefit, by
allowing full scope to his industry, and encouraging his
natural propensity to accumulate, agriculture on Java would
soon acquire a different character: it would soon become
active and enterprising; there would soon be created a difference
in farms and in the circumstances of individuals;
capital would be fixed and augmented in the hands of the
skilful and the industrious among the cultivators; the idle
and the indifferent would relinquish their possessions in their
favour; roads, intercourse, and markets would be increased,
the organization of society would be changed, and an improved
race would shew themselves, in some measure, worthy
of the most fertile region of the globe. What Egypt and
Sicily were in different ages to the south of Europe, Java<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Vol I Pg 180]</a></span>
might become to the south of Asia and the Indian Archipelago.
From the exertion with which the British government
endeavoured to lay the foundation of such improvements,
at first amid the embarrassments of a recent conquest,
and latterly with the prospect of only an intermediate possession;
from the attachment it cherished for a people whose
gratitude it deserved and acquired, and from the interest that
every friend of humanity must feel in the anticipation of
seeing this highly favoured island, the metropolis, the granary,
and the centre of civilization to the vast regions between the
coast of China and the Bay of Bengal, it might have been
expected, that those who were instrumental in introducing
the late arrangements, should watch with peculiar anxiety the
first movements of the power to which the colony was transferred,
and should look into the regulations for its Indian
empire for the support, or the death-blow, of the most animating
hopes. It must therefore be with peculiar satisfaction
that we see, with regard to the freedom of cultivation, the
Dutch government sanctions what we had done, and gives
our regulations permanency by embodying them in its colonial
policy. In articles seventy-eight and seventy-nine of the
fundamental laws for the civil, judicial, and mercantile administration
of India<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, we find the following enactments. "The
free cultivation of all articles of produce which may be
raised in the possessions of the state in India, is granted to
the inhabitants of these possessions; with the exception of
cloves, nutmegs, and opium, and without prejudice to the
regulations which might be adopted concerning the contingents
and forced deliveries, which on a resumption of
these possessions out of the hands of the English, will be
found to be continued in force. All the fruits of cultivation
raised within the possessions of the states beyond the
forced deliveries, and every kind of produce not comprehended
under the exceptions mentioned above, are to be
the lawful property of the cultivator. The free unrestrained
disposal thereof belongs to him of right, as soon as the land
rent assessed thereon, either in kind or money, shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Vol I Pg 181]</a></span>paid. It is the duty of the Indian administration to
maintain him in these rights." Let him be maintained
in those rights, and the Dutch government will realize a
revenue far beyond the amount of their former assessments,
without, as formerly, disgracing the Europeans in the eyes of
the Asiatic, by their weakness, corruption, and injustice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> These principles were contemplated as just and practicable by a Dutch
authority (Van Hogendorp) who resided on Java, and criticized freely
the measures of administration, as will appear from the following extracts
from a work, which only came into my possession subsequently to the introduction
of the new system by the British government. "Property of
the soil must be introduced by granting all the cultivated lands to those
who have hitherto cultivated them, or, in other words, to the common
Javans. All the rice fields belonging to each <em>désa</em> should be distributed
among its inhabitants, and the gardens or spots of ground in which
their cottages stand, should also, in future, be their personal property.
Correct registers hereof should be kept, and certificates given to the
different owners. Who can produce a better and nearer right to the
personal possession of the land, than he who has cultivated and made
it productive? And is there a country in the world where the natives
are happy, free, and well settled, without having a property in the soil?
Our own country, and all the kingdoms of Europe, afford the most direct
proofs of this: they flourish in proportion as property is more or
less secure and equally divided among the inhabitants of each. All
Europe groaned under the feudal system of government: all Europe
has freed itself from it; but by various means and in different degrees.
Why, therefore, can similar changes not be brought about on Java?
Every thing urges us to make them, and the results must be important
and most advantageous to us. Java is alone able to relieve our commonwealth
from all its difficulties.
</p>
<p>
"In order to collect a land-tax properly, a general and correct survey
should, in the first instance, be effected in all the districts belonging to
us, according to an established land measure, to be introduced generally
throughout Java; for this is, at present, very irregular. All the lands
should then be divided into three classes, first, second, and third class,
according to the proportionate fertility of the soil, and according to the
same proportion the land-tax should be established. I am very ready
to admit, that this will naturally be difficult and troublesome; but what
system of government is exempt from these inconveniences? and particularly
in this country, where it is necessary to effect a radical change
and reform, in order to produce any beneficial results? But with diligence,
zeal, and deliberation, all difficulties may be overcome; and even
should the survey not be exactly correct in the first instance, it might
be improved from year to year. The word <em>jung</em> is now used by the
Javans for a certain measure of land; but this differs so much in different
districts, that it is impossible to ascertain how many square roods of
land a <em>jung</em> ought to contain. The name might be retained, however,
after having found by experience how many square roods, in general or
on an average, are contained in a <em>jung</em>, the proportion might be once for
all established, introduced throughout the island, and fixed as the regular
land measure of the country. It would be difficult, and as yet unnecessary,
to calculate how many <em>jungs</em> of land our territories on Java
contain, and how much might be collected as a land-tax from each <em>jung</em>,
in order to ascertain what this tax would amount to. I think it should
be taken as a principle, that the land-tax can and ought to produce as
much as the head-money, (namely, a rix-dollar per head): the land-tax
would then yield an annual and certain income of at least two millions
and a half of rix-dollars. Every spot of cultivated ground being measured
and settled to which class it belongs, every owner will correctly
know, how much he must pay for land-tax annually, and be completely
at liberty to plant his land with whatever he may prefer, and may conceive
most conducive to his advantage. I am of opinion, that during
the first years it would be difficult, on account of the scarcity of specie,
or rather its absence from circulation, to collect the land-tax; but, in
the same way as with the head-money, it would be expedient, in the first
years, to be somewhat indulgent in the collection, or else to receive
produce in lieu of money, which might be done in this tax better than
the capitation. But after five years of good administration, I am certain
that the land-tax would be fully and without difficulty collected."</p></div>

<p>It is here proposed to state the progress made by the Javans
in a few of the common arts and handicrafts, and in one or
two of the more extensive manufactures; their docility in
working under European direction, and some other observations,
which could not be so appropriately placed in any other
part of this work. I have already had occasion to notice the
limited skill and simple contrivances with which they carry
on the labours of agriculture, and prepare the produce of the
soil for consumption, in the various ways that their taste or
their habits require. In a country like Java, where the structure
of society is simple, and the wants of the people are few,
where there is no accumulation of capital and little division
of professions, it cannot be expected that manufacturing skill
should be acquired, or manufacturing enterprize encouraged,
to any great extent. The family of a Javan peasant is almost
independent of any labour but that of its own members. The
furniture, the clothing, and almost every article required for a
family, being prepared within its own precincts, no extensive
market of manufactured commodities is necessary for the supply
of the island itself; and for foreign trade, the produce of
their soil is more in demand than the fruits of their skill or industry.
In a country where nature is bountiful, and where so
much of her bounty can be collected with so little labour to
pay for manufactures from abroad, there is but little encouragement
to withdraw the natives from the rice field, the
forest, or the coffee-garden, to the loom, the forge, or the
workshop; and it is not in this respect, certainly, that a
change of their habits would be beneficial. This short notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Vol I Pg 183]</a></span>
of Javan manufactures, therefore, must be very limited, both
in the number of the articles that it embraces, and in the importance
that Europeans may attach to them: for Java can
neither send us porcelain, like China; nor silks, shawls, and
cottons, like Western India. To a nation, however, so much
accustomed as we are to the exertions of manufacturing skill
and perfection of manufacturing machinery, it may not be uninteresting
to see the simple means, by which a half-civilized
people accomplish the objects which we attain by such expeditious
and ingenious processes. The most experienced naval
architect may be interested by the manner in which a savage
scoops his canoe.</p>

<p>The Javans have names in their language for most of the
handicrafts. The following enumeration of terms applied to
trades and professions will shew the extent to which the division
of labour is sometimes carried, while the foreign extraction
of some of them may, perhaps, serve to point out the
source whence they were derived.</p>

<p>I shall proceed to describe a few of the manufactures of the
island, without attending much to the order in which it might
be proper to arrange them. The construction of a habitation
is among the first and most necessary arts of uncivilized man,
as the perfection of architecture is one of the most convincing
proofs and striking illustrations of a high state of refinement.
I have already described the hut of the peasant, and have
mentioned that it is generally constructed of wood. Such structures
suit the climate of the country, and save the labour of the
people; but they are not rendered necessary by an ignorance
of more durable materials.</p>

<p>Bricks are manufactured in almost every part of the island,
being generally employed in the better sort of buildings, not
only by Europeans and Chinese, but by the natives of rank.
The quality of the clay varies greatly in different districts. It
is all obtained from the decomposition of the basaltic stones,
and possesses different degrees of purity, according to the proportion
and nature of the other earths which are adventitiously
mixed with it. In some parts of the island it is very pure,
and might be advantageously employed in the manufacture of
porcelain; but the natives are unacquainted with the principles
of this art: some instruction in the glazing of their
pottery would be of very general benefit. They are unacquainted
with the process of making glass.</p>

<p>Cut stones are, at present, but rarely used by the Javans,
and stone-cutting is almost exclusively performed by the
Chinese. But although the Javans do not, at present, possess
or practice any considerable skill in this art, the extensive remains
of edifices constructed in stone, and of idols carved from
the same materials, afford abundant testimony that the arts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Vol I Pg 185]</a></span>
architecture, sculpture, and statuary in stone, at one period
reached to a very high pitch on Java. As, however, these
arts have long been lost to the Javans, the consideration of
them rather falls within the department of antiquities than that
which we are now upon.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of <em>Grésik</em> there are several hills composed of
a soft white stone, which hardens on exposure to the air.
Stones are here cut in the quarry into regular squares of various
sizes, from that of a brick to the largest tomb-stone.
They are principally required for the latter purpose, and in
the cemeteries of <em>Grésik</em> and <em>Madúra</em> the inscriptions upon
them are very neatly executed. Beyond this, the skill of the
natives in stone-cutting does not at present pretend.</p>

<p>The covering of the native houses is generally of thatch.
In the maritime districts, <em>átap</em>, or thatch, is made almost exclusively
from the leaves of the <em>nípa</em> or <em>búyu</em>. In the preparation,
the leaflets separated from the common petiol are employed.
Being doubled, they are attached close to each other
on a stick of three feet in length, and when thus arranged
are placed on the roof, like shingles or tiles. The leaves of
the <em>gébang</em>, on account of their fan-like form, are differently
arranged: they constitute large mats, which are chiefly employed
for sides of houses or for composing temporary sheds,
but they are too large and brittle to form durable <em>átap</em>. In the
interior districts, where <em>nípa</em> does not grow, the houses are almost
uniformly thatched with a species of long grass called
<em>alang-alang</em> (the <em>lálang</em> of the Malay countries). Near large
forests, where bámbu abounds, the natives cover their houses
with this reed. The leaflets of the cocoa-nut cannot be made
into thatch, but wherever the sago and <em>nípa</em> grow, it is made
from their leaflets.</p>

<p>An article of household furniture in use among all classes,
and displaying in some cases considerable beauty and delicacy
of execution, is matting. Mats are made from several
species of pandanus, from a kind of grass called <em>mándong</em>,
and from the leaves of various palms. A species of the latter
affords the most common kinds, coarser and less durable than
others, as well as bags (straw sacks) resembling coarse mats:
the leaves being divided into laminæ, about one line in breadth,
are woven in the same manner and on the same frames as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Vol I Pg 186]</a></span>
coarse linen. These fibres, called <em>ágel</em>, are sometimes manufactured
into twine, which possesses but little strength. The
mats or bags, called <em>károng</em>, are much inferior to the gunny-bags
of India.</p>

<p>The coarsest kinds of mats, employed chiefly by the lower
class, are called in the central districts <em>klóso bóngko</em>; those
prepared from grass, <em>klóso mándong</em>; and the others, <em>klóso
psántrem</em> (from the place where they are made). The materials
of all these are plaited by hand. The <em>klóso psántrem</em>
are of superior quality, and in use through the central and
eastern parts of the island; especially among the natives of
the first class, with whom they constitute the principal furniture
of the dwelling-house. A person of the highest rank
aspires to no luxury, more delicate or expensive in this way,
than the possession of a bed composed of mats from <em>psántrem</em>.</p>

<p>A kind of umbrella hat worn by the common people, and
universal in the Súnda districts denominated <em>chápeng</em>, is also
manufactured in this manner, principally from <em>bámbu</em>, dyed
of various colours, which being shaped in the form and of the
size of a large wash-hand basin worn reversed, is rendered
impervious to the wet by one or more coverings of varnish.</p>

<p>A great part of the manufacturing ingenuity of every people
must be displayed in collecting the materials, or arranging
the fabrics of those articles of clothing, required for protection,
decency, or ornament. Whether these materials are derived
from the fleece, the fur, or the feathers of the larger
animals, from the covering of an insect, the bark of a tree, or
the down of a shrub, they have to undergo several laborious
and expensive processes before they are fit for use; and in
conducting these processes, or forming machinery for rendering
them more expeditious, complete, and easy, the superior
manufacturing skill of one nation over another is chiefly
evinced. The sheep on Java, as in all tropical climates, loses
its fleece before it can be used with advantage. The silk-worm
has never succeeded, although no reason can be given
why it should not, and therefore the chief material of Javan
clothing is cotton.</p>

<p>Cotton, in its rough state, is called <em>kápas</em>, and when cleaned
<em>kápok</em>. The process of separating the seeds is performed by
means of a <em>gilíng'an</em>, which is a roller, consisting of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Vol I Pg 187]</a></span>
wooden cylinders revolving in opposite directions, between
which the fibre is made to pass. This operation is very tedious,
two days being necessary for one person to clean a <em>káti</em>,
equivalent to a pound and a quarter English. After the separation
of the seed, it is <em>géblek</em>, or beaten with a rattan, and
<em>píndi</em> or picked. The finer sort is then bowed after the Indian
manner; this operation is called <em>wusóni</em>. The cotton thus
prepared is afterwards pulled out and drawn round a stick,
when it is called <em>púsuh</em>. To perform the process upon a
single <em>káti</em> will employ one person about two days. The
cotton is now ready for spinning (<em>'ngánti</em>), and requires ten
additional days' labour of one person, to convert the small
quantity above mentioned into yarn, when the result is found
to be three <em>tukal</em>, or hanks, of the ordinary kind.</p>

<p>Previous to the operation of weaving, the yarn is boiled,
and afterwards dressed and combed with rice-water. When
dry, it is wound round a sort of reel, termed <em>'íngan</em>, and prepared
for weaving. These are the last operations it undergoes
till it is put into the hands of the weaver, and requires, in
ordinary circumstances, three days for its completion. Four
days are required even by an expert weaver, and five or six
by an ordinary one, to manufacture a <em>sárong</em>, or piece of cloth,
a fathom and a half long and five spans broad (equal to three
square handkerchiefs of the ordinary size worn on the head).
The cloths thus prepared, while uncoloured, are distinguished
by the term <em>láwon</em>.</p>

<p>The spinning-wheel is termed <em>jántra</em>, and the spindle <em>kísi</em>.
The loom, with all its apparatus, is called <em>ábah ábah tenún</em>,
the shuttle <em>trópong</em>, the woof <em>máni</em>, and the warp <em>pákan</em>.
Both machines resemble those described on the continent of
India, but are neater and much better made: the loom especially
is more perfect: the weaver, instead of sitting in holes
dug in the ground, invariably sits on a raised flooring, generally
in front of the house, her legs being stretched out horizontally
under the loom. The price of the spinning-wheel
varies from less than half a rupee to a rupee, and that of the
loom from a rupee to a Spanish dollar. The operations of
spinning and weaving are confined exclusively to the women,
who from the highest to the lowest rank, prepare the cloths
of their husbands and their families.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Vol I Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Coloured cottons (<em>járit</em>) are distinguished into <em>lúri</em> or <em>lúri
gíng'gang</em>, those in which the yarn is dyed previously to
weaving; and <em>bátik</em>, those which are dyed subsequently.
The process of weaving the former is similar to that of the
gingham, which it resembles, and need not therefore be detailed;
but the latter, being peculiar to Java, may deserve a
more particular description.</p>

<p>The cloths termed <em>bátik</em> are distinguished into <em>bátik látur
púti</em>, <em>bátik látur írang</em>, or <em>bátik látur bang</em>, as the ground
may be either white, black, or red. The white cloth is first
steeped in rice water, in order to prevent the colour with
which the patterns are intended to be drawn, from running,
and when they are dried and smoothed (calendered), commences
the process of the <em>bátik</em>, which gives its name. This
is performed with hot wax in a liquid state, contained in a
small and light vessel, either of copper or silver, called <em>chánt-ing</em>,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
holding about an ounce, and having a small tube of
about two inches long, through which the liquid wax runs
out in a small stream. This tube, with the vessel to which it
is attached, being fixed on a stick about five inches long, is
held in the hand, and answers the purpose of a pencil, the
different patterns being traced out on both sides of the cloth
with the running wax. When the outline of the pattern is
thus finished, such parts of the cloth as are intended to be
preserved white, or to receive any other colour than the
general field or ground, are carefully covered in like manner
with the liquid wax, and then the piece is immersed in whatever
coloured dye may be intended for the ground of the pattern.
To render the colour deeper, cloths are occasionally
twice dipped. The parts covered with wax resist the operation
of the dye, and when the wax is removed, by being
steeped in hot water till it melts, are found to remain in their
original condition. If the pattern is only intended to consist
of one colour besides white, the operation is here completed;
if another colour is to be added, the whole of the first ground,
which is not intended to receive an additional shade, is
covered with wax, and a similar process is repeated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Vol I Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to render the dye fixed and permanent for the
scarlet or blood-red colour, the cloth is previously steeped in
oil, and after five days washed in hot water, and prepared in
the usual way for the <em>bátik</em>. In the ordinary course, the process
of the <em>bátik</em> occupies about ten days for common patterns,
and from fifteen to seventeen for the finer and more
variegated.</p>

<p>A very coarse kind of cloth, which serves for curtains or
hangings, is variously clouded, and covered sometimes with
rude figures, by the art of colouring the yarn, so as to produce
this effect when woven. For this purpose, the strands of the
yarn being distributed in lengths equal to the intended size
of the cloth, are folded into a bundle, and the parts intended
to remain white are so tightly twisted round and round, that
the dye cannot penetrate or affect them. From this party-coloured
yarn the designed pattern appears on weaving. The
cloths so dyed are called <em>gebér</em>.</p>

<p>The sashes of silk, called <em>chíndi</em>, are dyed in this manner,
as well as an imitation of them in cotton, called <em>jóng'grong</em>.</p>

<p>Of the several kinds of coloured cottons and silks there is
a very great diversity of patterns, particularly of the <em>bátik</em>, of
which not less than a hundred are distinguished by their
appropriate names. Among these are the patterns exclusively
worn by the sovereign, termed <em>bátik párang rúsa</em>, and <em>bátik
sáwat</em>, and others which designate the wearer, and are more
or less esteemed, as well on this account as their comparative
beauty of design and execution.</p>

<p>With the exception of blue and scarlet or blood-red, all the
dyes of the inhabitants are liable to fade, and the processes
offer nothing worthy of investigation or remark.</p>

<p>In dying blue, indigo, the palm wine of the <em>áren</em>, and various
vegetable acids are employed.</p>

<p>Black is obtained from an exotic bark called <em>tíng'i</em>, and the
rind of the <em>mangustin</em> fruit. In making the inferior infusion
for this and for various other dyes, the chaff of rice, called
<em>meráng</em>, is employed.</p>

<p>In dying green, a light blue is first induced, which is afterwards
converted into the requisite hue, by infusion in a decoction
of <em>tegráng</em> (an exotic wood), to which blue vitriol is
added.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Vol I Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Tegráng</em> alone affords a yellow colour, and generally is
qualified by receiving the addition of some bark of the <em>nángka</em>
and <em>plem-dodól</em>.</p>

<p>A beautiful and lasting scarlet and blood-red is obtained
from the roots of the <em>wóng-kudu</em>. The yarn or cloth is first
boiled in the oil of <em>wijen</em> or <em>kamíri</em>: being washed in a
decoction of <em>meráng</em> or burnt <em>pári</em> chaff, it is dried, and subsequently
immersed in an infusion of the roots of <em>wóng-kudu</em>,
the strength of which is increased by the addition of the bark
<em>jírak</em>, a variety of the fruit <em>kepúndung</em>. In the preparation
of this dye, the roots of the <em>wóng-kudu</em> are bruised and well
mixed with water, which is then boiled until it is reduced to
one third, when it is fit for use. No light red or rose colour
of durability is produced by the Javans: they employ for this
purpose the <em>kasomba kling</em>.</p>

<p>In several of the maritime districts, the <em>Maláyus</em> impart a
beautiful crimson colour to silk, by means of the <em>gúmlak tembálu</em>
or <em>embálu</em>, but with this Javans are unacquainted.</p>

<p>The <em>kápas jáwa</em>, or Java cotton, in its raw and uncleaned
state costs from about three halfpence to three pence the <em>káti</em>,
according to its quality, and the <em>kápas múri</em> from six to eight
pence. The price of each advances sometimes fifty per cent.
beyond this, when the production is scarce or out of season.</p>

<p>A <em>káti</em> of uncleaned Java cotton is calculated to produce
two and a half <em>túkul</em> or hanks of coarse, and three and a half
hanks of fine yarn; and a <em>káti</em> of <em>kápas múri</em>, five hanks of
the latter. The value of the former is from three to four
pence, and of the latter from seven to ten.</p>

<p>Three hanks and a half of coarse yarn, and from five to
nine of fine, make one <em>sárong</em>, or three head handkerchiefs,
the price of which, undyed, is from half a rupee to four
Spanish dollars; if dyed, the <em>ging'ams</em> bring from one rupee
to four Spanish dollars, and the <em>bátik</em> from a rupee and a half
to six Spanish dollars for the same quantity.</p>

<p>Another kind of coloured cottons, in imitation of the Indian
chintz, is also prepared; but it is not held in much estimation,
on account of the superiority of the foreign chintzes
imported, and the uncertainty of the colours, which the
natives allege will not stand in the same manner as those
which have undergone the process of the <em>batîk</em>, frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Vol I Pg 191]</a></span>
fading in the second washing. In these cloths, the patterns
being carved on small wooden blocks are stamped as in India.
They serve as coverlids, and are employed as a substitute for
the Indian palempore, when the latter is not procurable. The
price is about four rupees.</p>

<p>The natives of Java, like those of every other country,
must have been, from the earliest times, in the habit of manufacturing
various articles of leather; but the art of rendering
it more compact, more tough, and more durable, by the application
of the tanning principle, has been acquired only by
their connexion with Europeans. They now practice it with
considerable success, and prepare tolerable leather in several
districts. There are two trees of which the bark is particularly
preferred for tanning; one in the maritime districts,
the other in the interior. These, with some others which are
occasionally added, contain very large quantities of the
tanning principle, which makes excellent leather in a short
space of time. Of this native article, boots, shoes, saddles,
harness, &amp;c. are made in several parts of the island; but
in the greatest perfection at <em>Súra-kérta</em>, where the prices are
moderate, and the manufacture extensive and improving.
Neither the leather nor the workmanship of these articles
is considered much inferior to what is procured at Madras
and Bengal. The prices are moderate: for a pair of shoes
half a crown, for boots ten shillings, for a saddle from thirty
to forty shillings, and for a set of harness for four horses from
ten to twelve pounds.</p>

<p>Neither flax nor hemp is cultivated for the purposes of
manufacture. The latter is sometimes found in the gardens
of the natives of continental India, particularly at Batavia,
who employ it only to excite intoxication; but the island
affords various productions, the fibrous bark of which is made
into thread, ropes, and other similar articles. These are, with
one or two exceptions, never cultivated, and when required
for use, may be collected in sufficient quantity on spots where
they are of spontaneous growth. A particular account of
these has already been given in the first chapter, when describing
the vegetable productions of the island.</p>

<p>To enable rope or cord which is often exposed to water or
moisture, as fishing-nets, cables, and the like, to resist its
influence, the sap exuding from various trees is employed.

<p>No manufactures are calculated to show more clearly the
extent to which the arts of life are carried in a country, than
those in which the metals are used. Without the knowledge
of iron, our dominion over nature would be very limited; as
may be seen in the case of the Americans at the discovery of
the western hemisphere. The manufacture and use of iron
and steel has been known over the Eastern Islands, as well as
in the western world, from time immemorial. The various
iron implements of husbandry, the common implements and
tools, the instruments and military weapons now in use among
the natives of these regions, are fabricated by themselves.
The importance and difficulty of the art may be gathered
from the distinction which the knowledge and practice of it
conferred.</p>

<p>The profession of a smith is still considered honourable
among the Javans, and in the early parts of their history,
such artizans held a high rank, and were largely endowed
with lands. The first mention made of them is during the
reign of the chiefs of <em>Pajajáran</em>, in the eleventh century. On
the decline of that empire they went over, to the number of
eight hundred families, to <em>Majapáhit</em>, where they were kindly
received, and a record is preserved of the names of the head
master-smiths. On the destruction of that empire in the
fifteenth century, they were dispersed, and settled in different
districts of the island, where their descendants are still discoverable.
They are distinguished by the term <em>Pándi</em>.</p>

<p>Iron is cast in small quantities of a few ounces, and used
occasionally for the point of the ploughshare. The metal is
rendered fluid in about half an hour: charcoal is invariably
used, and the operation is termed <em>sing'i</em> or <em>chitak</em>.</p>

<p>The bellows, which is peculiar, and believed to have been
in use at the time of <em>Pajajáran</em> and <em>Majapáhit</em>, and of which
a representation sculptured in stone was found in the recently
discovered ruins at <em>Suku</em> (which bear date in the fourteenth
century of the Javan æra), appears to be the same as that
described by Dampier<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, in his account of <em>Majindánao</em> and
the neighbouring islands. "Their bellows," says this faithful
and intelligent traveller, "are much different from ours.
They are made of a wooden cylinder, the trunk of a tree,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Vol I Pg 193]</a></span>about three feet long, bored hollow like a pump, and set
upright on the ground, on which the fire itself is made.
Near the lower end there is a small hole in the side of the
trunk next the fire, made to receive a pipe, through which
the wind is driven by a great bunch of fine feathers fastened
to one end of the stick, which closing up the inside
of the cylinder, drives the air out of the cylinder through
the pipe. Two of these trunks or cylinders are placed
so nigh together, that a man standing between them may
work them both at once, alternately, one with each hand."
This account so exactly corresponds with the Javan bellows,
that no further description is necessary. The Chinese bellows
are partially used. The wages of a man skilled in iron-work
are sometimes as high as a rupee a day.</p>

<p>Cutlery of every description is made by the smith. The
most important manufacture of this kind is the <em>krís</em>, or dagger,
of the peculiar form well known to be worn by all the
more civilized inhabitants of the Eastern Islands.</p>

<p>The price of a <em>krís</em> blade, newly manufactured, varies from
half a rupee to fifty dollars; but the same <em>krís</em>, if it is of good
character, and if its descent can be traced for three or four
generations, is frequently prized at ten times that sum. A
<em>pándi</em> employed to manufacture a good <em>krís</em> blade, if the materials
are furnished, is paid three dollars for the job.</p>

<p>The manufacture of sheaths or scabbards (<em>sárong</em>) for the
krís constitute an exclusive profession; and the manufacturers
are called <em>túkang meráng'gi</em>, or <em>mergóngso</em>. These men
attend at the public market, where they occupy a particular
quarter, in which may be seen people employed in the
finishing or repair of every part of the mounting necessary for
this instrument; some upon the handle, others upon the
sheath; some in applying the paint and lacquer, others
attending with a preparation of acids and arsenic for cleaning
the blade, and bringing out the appearance of the <em>pámur</em>, a
white metal obtained from <em>Biliton</em> and Celebes, which is
worked up with the iron, in order to produce the damasked
appearance of the blade.</p>

<p>Copper is manufactured into the kettles and pots employed
by the natives for cooking; most of the other domestic vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Vol I Pg 194]</a></span>
are of brass, which is manufactured into various other articles,
from the smallest, such as buttons, ear-studs, and other ornaments,
in imitation of the gold patterns, to brass guns of considerable
calibre, employed for the defence of small vessels.
A very extensive foundery of this kind is established at <em>Grésik</em>.
From the specimen of the casts in brass, copper, &amp;c. which are
occasionally dug up near many of the ruinous temples sacred to
the ancient worship of the country, we may assert, that great
proficiency was once attained in this art: like that, however,
of stone-cutting, it has very much declined.</p>

<p>Gold and silver, as is well known, are wrought by the natives
of the Eastern Islands into exquisite ornaments; and the
Javans are by no means behind their neighbours, the Sumatrans,
in the knowledge of this manufacture. They do not,
however, usually work the gold into those beautiful filigree
patterns, described as common among the <em>Maláyus</em> on Sumatra,
nor is their work generally so fine.</p>

<p>Diamond-cutters, and persons skilled in the knowledge of
cutting precious stones, are also to be found in the principal
capitals.</p>

<p>Carving in wood is followed as a particular profession, and
the Javans may be considered as expert in all kinds of carpenter's
work, but more particularly in cabinet-work. They
imitate any pattern, and the furniture used by the Europeans
in the eastern part of the Island is almost exclusively of their
workmanship. Carriages and other vehicles are also manufactured
by the natives after the European fashion.</p>

<p>Boat and ship-building is an art in which the Javans are
tolerably well versed, particularly the former. The latter is
confined principally to those districts in which the Europeans
have built ships, for the Javans have seldom attempted the
construction of square-rigged vessels on their own account.
The best carpenters for ship-building are found in the districts
of <em>Rembáng</em> and <em>Grésik</em>, but small native vessels and boats
are continually constructed by the natives in almost every
district along the north coast.</p>

<p>When the quantity of teak timber, and the advantages of
Java in respect of ports and harbours, are considered, the
most flattering prospects are held out, that this Island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Vol I Pg 195]</a></span>
may, in time, be able to supply shipping to an increasing
commerce of its own, and perhaps aid the dock-yards of other
states.</p>

<p>Among the articles, the making of which may be interesting
to Europeans, from the difference of the materials used or the
process employed, is that of paper. The paper in common
use with the Javans is prepared from the <em>glúga</em> (morus papyrifera)
which is cultivated for this purpose, and generally
called the <em>delúwang</em>, or paper tree. Having arrived at the
age of two or three years, the young trees are cut while the
bark easily peels off, and the fragments are portioned about
twelve or eighteen inches in length, according to the intended
size of the paper. These fragments are first immersed in
water about twenty-four hours, in order that the epidermis
may be separated; this being effected, the fibrous tissue of
the inner bark is rendered soft and tractable by soaking in
water, and by long and repeated beating with a piece of wood.
During the intervals of this process, the fragments of the bark
are piled in heaps in wooden troughs, and the affusion of fresh
water is repeated till all impurities are carried off. The separate
portions, which are about two or three inches broad, are
then attached to each other on a plane surface, generally
formed by the trunk of a plantain tree, and the union of the
fibres is finally effected by continued beating. The quality
of the paper depends upon the care employed in the preparation,
and on the frequent affusion of fresh water. By applying
successive layers to the spots which are bare from the
defect of the fibres, and beating them till they unite, an uniform
thickness is attained. The paper which is intended for
writing is momentarily immersed in a decoction of rice, and
rendered smooth and equal, by being rubbed to a polish on a
plane surface. Such paper as is intended for common domestic
purposes, for packing goods, &amp;c. does not require this
operation: in this the fibrous contexture of the bark is quite
obvious; it much resembles a species of paper brought from
Japan, and manufactured from the same tree, and was formerly
employed instead of cloth by the poorer inhabitants. The
process of manufacturing is strikingly like that in use among
the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands, for the preparation
of their cloth. The culture of this plant, as well as the manu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Vol I Pg 196]</a></span>facture
of paper, is chiefly confined to particular districts,
where it forms the principal occupation of the priests, who
gain a livelihood by it.</p>

<p>Large quantities of a coarse and homely sugar, distinguished
by the name of Javan sugar, are prepared from the
cocoa-nut, <em>áren</em>, and other palms. The average quantity of
liquor extracted from one of these trees during a day and
night, is about two quarts, and this is estimated to give from
three to four ounces of sugar. The trees begin to yield it
at about six or seven years of age, and continue to do so for
ten or twelve years. The process of preparing the sugar is
extremely simple: it consists merely in boiling the liquor in
an earthen pot for a few hours, and afterwards pouring it into
small cases made of leaves and prepared for the purpose, in
which, when cool, it attains a due consistence.</p>

<p>Sugar from the cane is manufactured by the Chinese alone;
the process followed resembles that of the West Indies. The
juice is expressed between two rollers, sometimes turned by a
water-wheel; but in all cases the machinery is rude and imperfect.
The quality of the sugar made on Java is considered
to be equal to that of Manilla and the West Indies: it contains
as much of the saccharine principle as the latter, and is
brought to a drier state. It differs from the sugar of Bengal,
as much in its quality as in the mode of preparing it, but can
be brought to market at about the same price. Considerable
quantities are sent to the Malabar coast, but the principal exportation
is to Japan and Europe.</p>

<p>The manufactory of Batavian arrack, the superior quality of
which is well known, is also conducted by the Chinese: the
process is as follows: About seventy pounds of <em>kétan</em> (glutinous
rice) is heaped up in a small vat; round this heap or
pile one hundred cans of water are poured, and on the top
twenty cans of molasses. After remaining two days in this
vat, the ingredients are shifted to a larger vat adjoining, when
they receive the addition of four hundred cans of water and
one hundred cans of molasses.</p>

<p>Thus far the process is carried on in the open air. In a
separate vat within doors, forty cans of palm wine or toddy
from the cocoa-nut tree, are immediately mixed with nine
hundred cans of water and one hundred and fifty cans of mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Vol I Pg 197]</a></span>lasses.
Both preparations being allowed to remain in this
state for two days, the former of these preparations is carried
to a still larger vat within doors, and the latter being in a vat
placed above, is poured upon it, through a hole bored for the
purpose near the bottom. In this state the preparation is
allowed to ferment for two days, when it is poured into small
earthen jars, containing about twenty cans each, in which
it remains for the further period of two days: it is then
distilled.</p>

<p>The liquor drops into a tin vessel under ground, from whence
it is ladled into receiving vessels. This is the third or common
sort of arrack, which by a second distillation in a smaller
still, with the addition of a small quantity of water, becomes
the second sort, and by a third distillation, what is called the
first sort. The third or common sort is called by the Chinese
<em>síchew</em>, the second <em>tánpo</em>, and the first <em>kíji</em>, the two latter
being distinguished as arrack <em>ápi</em>. When cooled, it is poured
into large vats in the storehouses, where it remains till it is
convenient to put it into casks.</p>

<p>The whole process, therefore, to the completion of the first
sort, does not require more than ten days, six hours being
sufficient for the original preparation to pass through the first
still. The receivers of the stills are of copper, and the worm
consists of about nine turns of Banka tin.</p>

<p>The proof of sufficient fermentation is obtained by placing
a lighted taper about six inches above the surface of the liquor
in the fermenting vat; if the process is sufficiently advanced,
the fixed air rises and extinguishes the light.</p>

<p>To ascertain the strength of the spirit, a small quantity of
it is burnt in a saucer, and the residuum measured. The difference
between the original quantity and the residuum gives
the measure of the alcohol lost.</p>

<p>Among the most important manufactures of Java, both
viewed in its relation to the comforts of the inhabitants and
the interests of the revenue, is that of salt. In almost every
country it is an indispensable commodity, but particularly
where the people subsist on a vegetable diet, as in India and
the Eastern Islands; and wherever government has seen it
necessary, it has been converted into a source of taxation.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of the north-east coast of Java and <em>Má<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Vol I Pg 198]</a></span>-dúra</em>
abounds with places well calculated for its manufacture,
and unfit for any other useful purpose. The quantity already
manufactured has for many years exceeded the demand,
both for home consumption and exportation, and might be increased
almost <em>ad libitum</em>.</p>

<p>On Java the principal salt-pans are situated at <em>Pákis</em>, in the
vicinity of Batavia; at <em>Bantam</em>, <em>Chéribon</em>, <em>Tégal</em>; at <em>Wédong</em>
and <em>Bráhang</em>, in the <em>Semárang</em> districts; at <em>Paradési</em>, in
<em>Rembáng</em>; at <em>Sedáyu</em>, <em>Grésik</em>, and <em>Simámi</em>; on <em>Madúra</em>, at
<em>Sámpang</em>, <em>Pamákasan</em>, and <em>Súmenap</em>. Salt is also manufactured
at several places along the south-coast, but of inferior
quality, and by a different process. About two hundred tons
are annually procured in the interior, from the <em>Blédegs</em>, as already
described. The principal supply, however, is from the
north-coast, where the quality of the salt, and the facility with
which it can be manufactured, give it a decided advantage in
demand and cheapness.</p>

<p>The process of manufacturing the salt on the north-coast is
very simple, and depending on evaporation by the heat of the
sun alone, may be favourably contrasted with the comparatively
expensive process adopted in the Bengal provinces.
Reservoirs are filled from the sea at high tide, and in them
the water is allowed to remain for several days; this being
found necessary to prevent the salt from being bitter. It is
then conveyed by means of canals and sluices to the pans,
which are distributed in compartments and banked in, so as
to contain the sea-water, much in the same manner as the rice
fields. If the weather be dry and the sun clear, five days are
found sufficient for the process of evaporation in the pans;
after which the salt is collected together in heaps, where it
usually remains five days longer before it is brought into store.</p>

<p>Under the Dutch government, the manufacture of salt was
fanned out to Chinese as an exclusive privilege; and to these
farms, under the plea of enabling the farmer to command a
sufficient number of hands for conducting his undertaking,
and enabling him to make his advances to government, extensive
tracts of rice land were attached, over the population of
which the farmer was allowed unlimited authority. By a continued
extension of these tracts, a population far more numerous
than the work at the salt-pans required was wrested from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Vol I Pg 199]</a></span>
the administration of the regents and transferred to the
Chinese: as they found their advantage in renting out the rice-fields,
and employing the people in the transport of goods and
other laborious offices of the country, the farms of course sold
for more money. Under this system, it is difficult to say what
was the actual cost of the salt to the farmer: the manufacturers
were partly remunerated in land and partly in money, and the
mode varied in every district; but this remuneration seldom
amounted to more than a bare subsistence.</p>

<p>It was the practice of these farmers-general to underlet to
other Chinese the privilege of selling salt, supplying them with
the article at a certain rate, and these under-farmers sold the
salt again to the petty retailers in the public markets at an advanced
price. The price of the salt, after passing through the
hands of the farmers, varied not only according to the distance
from the place of manufacture, but according to the capital
and speculation of the under-farmer; if he adopted the liberal
system of obtaining small profits upon a large sale, the market
was abundantly supplied at a low rate; but if, on the contrary,
he traded on a small capital, and enhanced the price by insufficiently
answering the demand, the price became proportionally
exorbitant. In some places, as at <em>Salátiga</em> and
<em>Ung'arang</em>, through which the salt was transported by inland
carriage to the populous districts of the interior, the price was
sometimes as high as one hundred and twenty, and even one
hundred and forty Spanish dollars per <em>kóyan</em>, while along the
coast, as at <em>Chéribon</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>, it was as low as thirty,
and at <em>Grésik</em> twenty-five. The average in the year 1813,
when the farming system was abolished, may be taken, one
district with another, at about fifty-seven Spanish dollars the
<em>kógan</em>, or rather less than thirty dollars per ton.</p>

<p>The quantity usually calculated for the annual consumption
of Java and <em>Madúra</em>, including about one thousand
<em>kóyans</em> estimated to be manufactured in the native provinces,
is sixteen thousand <em>kóyans</em>, or thirty-two thousand tons. Under
the arrangements now adopted for the manufacture and
sale of this article, the average rate at which the manufacturers
are paid is about six rupees the <em>kóyan</em>, including the
charges of transport to the depôts, and the sale price varies
from twenty-five to thirty-five Spanish dollars, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Vol I Pg 200]</a></span>
the distance from the principal depôts; an adequate supply
by means of smaller depôts is insured in every part of the
country.</p>

<p>The salt of Java exported to the other islands of the Archipelago,
competes with that of Siam and the Coromandel coast,
and generally supersedes it, both on account of its quality and
cheapness. The exportation is free to all places except Bengal,
where, on account of its interference with the monopoly
there established, it has, since the conquest of Java, been found
necessary to prohibit its importation under penalty of confiscation.</p>

<p>The salt of the south coast being manufactured by a process
which is much more expensive than that employed on the
north, and at the same time being inferior in quality, it is only
consumed in places which the latter is prevented from reaching
by the difficulty of conveyance or inland tolls and prohibitions;
and it has consequently been calculated, that the
north coast salt, if allowed to pass toll free through the country,
would in a short time supersede that from the south altogether.
The inferior quality of the latter is caused by the quantity
of the sulphate of magnesia it contains, which renders it
by its bitterness unpleasant for culinary purposes.</p>

<p>Of late years, the value of the manufacturing industry of the
country may be in some degree be appreciated from the assistance
it has afforded to the European government, when, in consequence
of the war, the importation of European articles had
become insufficient for the public service. Broad cloth not
being procurable for the army, a kind of coarse cotton cloth
was manufactured by the Javans, with which the whole army
was clothed. At <em>Semárang</em> were established five of these
manufactories, having seventy or eighty looms each. One or
two of them made cotton lace, and supplied the army agents
with epaulets, shoulder-knots, tassels, &amp;c. There were likewise
manufactures of cotton stockings, tape, fringes, cartridge-boxes,
sword-belts, saddles, bridles, &amp;c. and in short every
thing that could be required for the dress and accoutrements
of both cavalry and infantry.</p>

<p>Under European superintendents were established saltpetre
works, powder-mills, foundries for shells, shot, anvils, &amp;c.
and manufactories of swords and small arms; and when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Vol I Pg 201]</a></span>
added, that the French government found means, within the
the resources of Java alone, to equip an army of not less than
fifteen thousand effective men, besides a numerous militia in
every district, and that, with the exception of a few European
superintendants in the more scientific works, all the articles
were manufactured and supplied by the natives, it is not necessary
to adduce any further proof of the manufacturing ability
of the country.</p>

<p>Saltpetre is obtained in many parts of the island, and gunpowder
has long been manufactured by the native inhabitants.
A saltpetre manufactory was established near <em>Grésik</em>, under
the superintendance of European officers, which it was calculated
would furnish annually two thousand <em>píkuls</em> of that article
to government, at the rate of eight rix-dollars per <em>píkul</em>,
or one hundred and thirty-three pounds English. The importance
of this establishment is manifest in the following observations
of Colonel Mackenzie.</p>

<p>"I considered that one day would be usefully employed in
viewing the saltpetre works, which a very few years back
had been established here, at the risk, and by the zeal and
ingenuity of private individuals, with the view of supplying
this colony with that necessary ingredient for gunpowder.
The best sulphur is supplied from a mountain near the
straits of <em>Báli</em>. For further details of these mines; of the
manner in which the nitre is obtained, by an ingenious application
of the latest European improvements in chemistry;
of the sulphureous crater of the mountain, whence the sulphur,
in its utmost purity, is supplied; of the reports of the
French engineers, last year, on the improvement of the gunpowder
of Java; of the wood selected for the best charcoal,
and of the present state of the manufactory and powder-mills
at <em>Semárang</em>, I must refer, at present, to several papers collected
by me on this subject, which may be usefully applicable
to our manufactures of gunpowder in India. Passing
over these and other considerations, I shall only observe, that
of these mines, one of them is cut in caverns into the soft
white calcareous rock; and another, more regularly designed,
supported by pillars or masses of the native rock, covers regularly
formed beds of the native earth, which being impregnated
with the native nitre, saturated with the evacuation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Vol I Pg 202]</a></span>
the numerous bats that haunt these caverns, and mixed with
a compound of wood ashes, supplies the liquid that is boiled
in large kettles, and afterwards left to cool and crystallize.
The whole process is carried on, in a regular manner, under
the direction of the first executor of this really grand work,
who now resides at <em>Surabáya</em><a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>."</p>

<p>The labour of felling the teak trees and transporting the timber
from the forests, gives employment to a very considerable
population, who are distinguished from those employed in other
avocations, by the term of <em>blándong</em> people, or foresters. The
teak timber was formerly delivered to the government as a contingent,
by the regents of those districts in which the principal
forests were situated, the quantity being regulated according to
the supposed extent of the different forests, and the means of
cutting and transporting the wood. Previously to the year
1808, the amount of this annual contingent was eight thousand
eight hundred beams of different sizes, according to the wants
of the public service, of which more than three thousand were
delivered from the central forests of <em>Rembáng</em>.</p>

<p>The cutting and dragging of the timber delivered in contingent
was performed by the inhabitants of the villages adjacent
to the forests, and the buffaloes required were left to be provided
by the regents. For this service, in the <em>Rembáng</em> districts,
four hundred cutters and labourers, and four hundred and
twelve pair of buffaloes, were appropriated for the supply of
three thousand one hundred beams annually, a proportion
which varied in the other districts, only according to the distance
of the forest from the timber yard on the coast, where
payment was made for timber on delivery, at the rate of sixteen
pence for cutting and conveying a beam of from eighteen to
twenty feet long and from nine to ten inches broad, forty-eight
stivers for a beam of from thirty-one to thirty-six feet long and
from thirteen to fifteen inches broad, and for others in proportion.
This was the regular and only payment made for the
contingent timber; but when the demands of government exceeded
the fixed contingent, which was generally the case, the
excess was paid for at an advance of fifty per cent. on these
prices. Crooked and other timber for ship-building was paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Vol I Pg 203]</a></span>
for at about the same rate, but calculated according to a fixed
table by the weight.</p>

<p>Under this system, the regents rented out many of the villages
adjoining the forests to individuals, and sold, on their own
account, such timber as was not of proper quality to be delivered
to government. As the demands of government increased,
as well as those of the European residents, who were many of
them concerned in ship-building and in the sale of timber, the
forests near the coast were soon exhausted of their best timber,
and as it became necessary for the cutters to go further into the
interior, the labour and expense increased, but without any
corresponding recompense to them, for the government never
raised the price. Individuals, however, did so; and the consequence
was, that government finding no regulations they could
make for the internal management of the forests sufficient to
ensure them an adequate supply, were contented to believe that
a greater quantity than was actually furnished could not be cut
without injury to the forests; although, at that very time, the
deliveries to individuals in the eastern districts were estimated
at not less than fifty or sixty thousand beams per annum, the
coast was lined with Java-built trading vessels of every description,
and these, as well as the rough timber, were frequently
sent for sale to a distant market.</p>

<p>In the year 1808, however, in common with all the other
departments on the island, this important one was newly organized
by Marshal Daendels, who placing the highest value on
the forests, and determining to prevent the abuses which had
previously existed, removed all the population which had formerly
been engaged in the forests in the different parts of the
island from the controul of the native regent, as well as the
local European authority, and placed them, with the villages
and lands to which they were attached, under a separate
board or administration for the forest department. This change
effectually secured government in the monopoly, and succeeded
in the prevention of the abuses which had formerly
existed: but in the degree that it had this effect, it also
operated to the serious injury of general commerce and the
domestic comfort of the inhabitants; for every one was now
obliged to buy the timber from government, at a high monopoly
rate fixed by general regulation, and the timber could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Vol I Pg 204]</a></span>
only be obtained in comparatively small quantities, seldom of
the dimensions required, and only at the fixed staples. Ship-building,
and even boat-building, which had before been carried
to the greatest extent along the whole coast, was discontinued,
and the cottage of the native, which had formerly cost
a few rupees, now cost ten times the amount if built of desirable
materials.</p>

<p>Under the administration of the Board of Forest, whose residence
was fixed at <em>Semárang</em>, and who were altogether
independent of the local authorities, was now placed a population
of nearly one hundred thousand souls, exclusively devoted
to the labours of the forests; and as no revenue had
been given up by the arrangement, and a small annual delivery
of iron, salt, and gunpowder, to the foresters, was the only
payment made, considerable profit was expected to result
from it to the government. It was found, however, after the
establishment of the British government, that the timber which
had been cut, and of which there was an immense quantity on
hand, was not of a description required for the building
of coasting vessels, and could not compete in Bengal with that
of Pegu, without such a reduction in the monopoly price, as
added to the loss occasioned by so large a proportion of the
population, who were set apart for this duty and contributed
nothing else to the revenue, the extent of the establishment
necessary to enable the government to be the sole timber
merchant, and the abuses connected with it, would amount to
more than all the profits that had been calculated on. The
coasting trade was perishing for want of vessels, and the forest
department was a losing concern. Under these circumstances,
it was judged expedient to include the population of the <em>Blándongs</em>
in the general arrangements for the release of the
peasantry from feudal bondage, and the establishment of a
fixed rent from the land, in lieu of all services and payment
formerly rendered.</p>

<p>The people who lived near the forests, and had long been
in the habit of cutting and dragging the timber, still however
continued in this employment, an annual contract being made
with them for their services in the forests, in remuneration for
which a remission of rent was granted. The largest and most
valuable forests are, under this system, reserved for the exclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Vol I Pg 205]</a></span>sive
use of government; others of less value, and the limits of
which can be easily defined, have, in consideration of a recognition
of ten per cent. <em>ad valorem</em> on the timber when worked
up, been thrown open to individuals engaged in ship-building,
who generally contract with the people of the adjoining villages,
to cut and deliver the timber at fixed prices: a mode
which has also been occasionally resorted to by government,
especially for the inferior and small kinds of timber, shingles,
pipe staves, &amp;c. which are allowed to be cut in particular
forests.</p>

<p>The industry which has been excited by opening these facilities
in procuring timber, and the impetus which it has
afforded to trade, may be estimated by this fact, that within
the last few years have been launched no less than ten to
twelve square-rigged vessels, of from one hundred and fifty to
four hundred tons, and that many more of larger dimensions
were about to be built, when the restoration of the colony was
announced.</p>

<p>It need hardly be observed, that due precautions have been
taken for the preservation and renovation of the valuable
forests, which so far from being exhausted, are capable of
supplying besides crooked and compass timber for ship-building,
forty or fifty thousand beams in the year without injury.
European overseers are appointed, and one general superintendent
is placed over the whole.</p>

<p>As illustrative of the importance attached to these forests
by the Dutch, and of the capabilities of the island for ship-building,
it may not be uninteresting to annex an extract from
Mr. Hogendorp's appeal to the authorities in Holland on this
subject.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Vol I Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Blandong</em> people or foresters are generally employed
in cutting or in dragging timber during eight months out of
the twelve, but they are obliged to watch the forests the whole
year through: they are regularly relieved, and half the working
men are at all times left disposable for the rice fields.
The <em>Blandong</em> people have always been accustomed to the
work, and generally have their villages near the principal
forests. It is one of the advantages of the system of contracting
with the people for land payments, that in emergencies
they are willing to lend their own buffaloes to assist those of
government in dragging heavy timber, which could not be
removed otherwise without great expence, while their children
at other times watch and attend the cattle belonging to government.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Vol I Pg 207]</a></span>In short, the resources of the village are at the
disposal of government, for a land payment considerably less
than one-third of the expence of hired labourers, whom it
would be difficult to procure, and still more difficult, from the
character of the people, to retain in constant and unremitting
employment.</p>

<p>Under the system of granting remissions of rent, it has been
calculated that in the districts of <em>Semárang</em>, where the assessment
is comparatively high, on account of the vicinity to a
large capital, a remission of eight rupees and a half, or about
twenty shillings, being the average amount paid annually by
each cultivator, government obtains a man's hard labour for
six months of the year. But as the inhabitants of the same
village are generally accustomed to labour in the fields alternately,
and thus to assist each other, it has been found advisable
to make the remissions of rent for the <em>Blandongs</em> to
the village <em>as a community</em>, in order to avoid the delay and
endless vexation which would ensue, in adjusting the petty
claims of each individual.</p>

<p>In the maritime districts on the north-east side of the
island, a very large proportion of the population is employed
in the fisheries, and so moderate are the seasons, that except
perhaps for a few days at the change of the monsoon, they are
seldom interrupted by the weather.</p>

<p>The sea fish is taken either by the net, in stakes (<em>wídi</em>),
or with the hook and line: the most considerable quantity is
of course procured by means of the two former, generally distinguished
by the term <em>máyang</em>, whence <em>práhu máyang</em>, fishing
boat. The whole apparatus of the hook and line is called
<em>pánching</em>, the usual term for angling among the <em>Maláyus</em>.
The fishing-boats quit the shore at about three or four o'clock
in the morning, and are driven out by the land breeze beyond
sight before daylight. At about noon they are seen returning
with the sea-breeze, and generally reach the shore by two
in the afternoon. The stakes along the whole of the northern
coast, wherever the banks and projecting land admit, are very
extensive: they are often fixed in several fathom water, and
constitute a very important property. They are usually closed
in the night.</p>

<p>Nets are principally made of <em>rámi</em>, though sometimes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Vol I Pg 208]</a></span>
<em>gadáng'an</em>, and even of cotton. They are steeped in an infusion,
which not only darkens their colour, but is considered
essentially to contribute to their strength. Fish that is not
eaten or disposed of while fresh, is salted and dried in the
sun, or smoke-dried at a short distance from a fire, and in
that state forms an extensive article of internal commerce.
Besides the abundance of fish thus obtained from the sea, extensive
tracts of country, salt marshes, and inlets of the sea,
have in several parts of the island been converted into fish-ponds
(<em>támba</em>). These ponds are to be found in most of the
low maritime districts: those at <em>Grésik</em>, which are the most
extensive, appear to have been first established during the
visit of one of the early Mahomedan princes of the island in
the fifteenth century. The <em>bándeng</em> is generally considered as
the richest and highest-flavoured fish known in these seas:
the young fry are taken in the sea, and transferred to these
ponds, where they grow and fatten for seven months, when
they are fit for the table. An annual supply of young fish
from the sea is found necessary to keep up the stock in the
tanks; and, whether from a desire to raise the value of the
fish so obtained in them, or otherwise, the natives generally
affirm, that the fish rarely attains its full size in the sea. The
extent and value of these nurseries for the fish may be estimated
from the rent paid for those at <em>Grésik</em>, which are the
property of government.</p>

<p>The river fish are taken by a variety of methods: one is to
throw a number of branches of trees into a deep part of the
river; here the fish collect: they are then surrounded by
stakes, or the branches are taken out, and the fish easily
caught; this method is termed <em>rúmpon</em>. <em>Bámbu</em> fences are
sometimes thrown across the rivers at night, and so constructed
that the fish are easily entrapped as they pass down
the stream: this method is called <em>pásang wádong</em>. The rivers
and ponds are frequently dragged by nets of different sizes.
The <em>coculus indicus</em>, and other intoxicating drugs, are sometimes
thrown into the river, after which the fish are found
floating on the surface and easily taken; this method, termed
<em>túba</em>, is prohibited on large rivers: when the fish are afterwards
driven down the river by a number of men into a snare
laid below, the usual term is <em>jámprong</em>. In the western dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Vol I Pg 209]</a></span>tricts,
a fishing party of this description affords a very favourite
amusement on great occasions. A time is selected when
the river is moderately low; temporary stands made of the
trunks of small trees or stout <em>bámbus</em> are then thrown across,
each consisting of three piles, fastened together at the top and
expanding below, the bottoms being pointed so as to fix in
the ground. On a small stage on each, just above the surface
of the water, are piled a few stones, by which they are steadied
while the current is allowed a free course below. The piers
or stages thus formed, answer well for the construction of a
temporary bridge over the rocky or stony bed of the most
irregular river. A coarse matting, made of <em>bámbu</em> or some
other material, is then carried from one to the other, so as to
shut the current in within a narrow space, across which a
temporary platform and shed is thrown, with a sloping floor
rising above the surface of the water, to where the party is
assembled. The drug having been thrown into the river, a
considerable distance higher up several hundred people now
enter the river, and driving the half-intoxicated fish before
them, they come floundering one after the other on the <em>bámbu</em>
stage, to the no small amusement of the party collected, fish
of a considerable size literally jumping into their laps. On
these occasions, when the entertainment is given to Europeans,
a great concourse of people attend, a feast is prepared, and
the wild and antic music and dance of the mountaineers, performing
on the <em>ánklang</em> and rude drum, give great peculiarity
and zest to the amusement. Fish are sometimes struck at
night by torch light, both at sea and in the rivers; but this
method is not very general.</p>

<p>Pearls are obtained in the vicinity of <em>Bányuwáng'i</em>, where
the privilege of fishing for them is farmed out by the year, as
well as in the vicinity of <em>Núsakambáng'an</em>, on the south side of
the island; but they are generally of the description called
seed pearls, and of little value.</p>

Our fleets are destroyed, our trade languishes, our navigation
is going to ruin​&mdash;we purchase with immense treasures, timber and
other materials for ship-building from the northern powers, and on Java
we leave warlike and mercantile squadrons standing with their roots in
the ground. Yes, the forests of Java have timber enough to build a
respectable navy in a short time, besides as many merchant ships as we
require. Hemp would grow as well as in Bengal, and as labour is as
cheap in Java, we may consequently presume that it would require little
trouble to establish manufactures of canvas and cordage there in a
short time. But, at any rate, Java already produces at a very low price
cayar and gamuti cordage, which answers very well for cables, hawsers,
and rigging. To build ships at Java for the mother country, it is only
necessary to send out skilful and complete master-builders with a few
ship carpenters; for common workmen are to be had on Java in numbers,
and at a very low rate, as a good Java carpenter may be hired at
five stivers a day. The principal objection that could be made is, that
the shores of Java being very flat and level, are not well adapted for
building, and still less for launching ships of heavy burthens, but this
difficulty may be easily overcome: on the islands before Batavia, and
particularly Brunt and Cooke's Island, wharfs, or even docks, may be
constructed at little expence. The same may be observed of one of the
islands off Japára and at Grésik, besides many other places in the eastern
division, in the harbour which is formed by the island of Madúra, and
which is sheltered from every wind.

<p>
"The resident of Rembáng, and sometimes of Jawána, are almost the
only Europeans who build ships, for it is too difficult and dangerous for
others to undertake it, under the arbitrary government at present existing
in Java, under which nothing can flourish or succeed. But the
Chinese, who are favoured in every thing, are well aware how to turn
this also to their own advantage, and to build a great number of vessels
all along the coast, from fifteen to two hundred tons burthen, for which
they get the timber almost for nothing, by means of renting the forest
villages. It is easy to imagine, how these avaricious bloodsuckers use
the forests, and manage to get all they can out of them. In spite of
all this, however, the forests of Java grow as fast as they are cut, and
would be inexhaustible under good care and management.
</p>
<p>
"At Bombay, Surat, and Demaun, and other places along the coast of
Malabar, at Bengal, and at Pegu, the English build many large and fine
ships, which last a length of time, especially those of Bombay and Malabar
built, although I believe the wood produced there, however good,
is not equal to the teak of Java."

<p>From the importance which the Dutch, in the days of their
greatness, attached to their East-India commerce, of which
Batavia was the emporium, and the importance which this
commerce conferred upon them, from the desire excited in the
other nations to obtain a share in its advantages, and the crimes
committed to maintain its undivided monopoly, some idea may
be formed of its magnitude and value. When the French
troops, in the summer of 1672, under Louis XIV. had overrun
the territory of Holland, with the rapidity and irresistible force
of the sea after bursting the dykes, the Republic formed the
magnanimous resolution of transporting its wealth, its enterprise,
and its subjects to another hemisphere, rather than submit
to the terms of the conqueror, and fixed upon Batavia,
already the seat of its eastern commerce, as the capital of its
new empire. They could have found shipping in their own
ports for the transport of fifty thousand families; their country
was inundated with the ocean, or in possession of the invader;
their power and political importance consisted in their fleets
and colonies; and having been accustomed to maintain their
naval superiority by the fruits of their eastern trade, and to
buy the corn of Europe with the spices of the Moluccas, they
would have felt less from a removal of their seat of empire
from the north of Europe to the south of Asia, than any people
who ever contemplated a similar change; while, at the same
time, the very project of such an extraordinary emigration, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Vol I Pg 211]</a></span>
the means they had of carrying it into effect, give us the highest
ideas of the independent spirit inspired by their free government,
and of their commercial prosperity, derived, in a great
degree, from their eastern establishments and connexions.</p>

<p>The same advantages which the Europeans derived from
the navigation of the Mediterranean, the inhabitants of the
Malayan Archipelago enjoyed in a higher degree; and it cannot
be doubted, that among islands lying in smooth and unruffled
seas, inviting the sail or oar of the most timid and inexperienced
mariner, an intercourse subsisted at a very early
period. To this intercourse, and to the fertility of the soil of
Java, which soon rendered it an agricultural country, must be
attributed the high degree of civilization and of advancement
in the arts, which, from the monuments of its progress which
still exist, there is every reason to believe it once attained.
In short, to adopt the expressions of Dr. Adam Smith, when
speaking of a very different country<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>, Java, "on account of
the natural fertility of its soil, of the great extent of its sea-coast
in proportion to the whole of the country, and of the
number of its navigable rivers, affording the conveniency of
water carriage to some of its most inland parts, is conveniently
fitted by nature to be the seat of foreign commerce,
of manufactures for sale to the neighbouring countries, and
of all the improvements which these can occasion."</p>

<p>But though there can be little doubt that Java very early
emerged from barbarism, and rose to great commercial prosperity,
to determine the precise time at which these events took
place is perhaps impossible; and to approach the solution of
the question would involve an inquiry that will be better reserved
till we come to treat of its languages, institutions, and
antiquities. If, in the consideration of these topics, it should
be made to appear, that, in very remote ages, these regions
were civilized from Western India, and that an extensive
Hindu empire once existed on Java, it will be reasonable to
infer a commercial intercourse still earlier than the communication
of laws and improvement.</p>

<p>In the remarkable account of the rich commodities conveyed
to ancient Tyre, it would appear that there were many articles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Vol I Pg 212]</a></span>
the peculiar produce of the Malayan States; and in that given
by Strabo of the importations into Egypt, cloves, which we
know to be the exclusive produce of the Moluccas, are expressly
mentioned. The same taste for the fine kinds of spices,
and the same desire to obtain them, which prompted European
nations successively to make themselves masters of these
islands, must in all probability have operated, in a very remote
period, on the merchants of Hindustan, and even of
countries lying farther to the westward, who had already
found their way into the gold regions; and if the hypothesis,
which places Mount <em>Ophir</em> on Sumatra or the peninsula of
Malacca, cannot be maintained, it will at any rate be admitted,
that previously to the discovery of America, no country
was known more rich in gold than the Malayan Islands, and
that, on that account, they were peculiarly attractive to foreigners,
who could not be supplied from any other quarter.</p>

<p>The Arabs, it is known, had in the ninth century, if not
long previously, made themselves acquainted with these
countries; and the Chinese, if we may trust the Javan
annals, had visited Java at the same period. According to
Kempfer, the <em>Maláyus</em> in former times had by far the greatest
trade in the Indies, and frequented, with their vessels, not
only all the coasts of Asia, but even ventured to the shores of
Africa, and particularly to the great island of Madagascar;
"for," adds this author, "John de Barros in his Decades,
and Flaccourt in his History of Madagascar, assures us,
that the language spoken by the inhabitants of that large
African island is full of Javan and Malayan words: subsisting
proofs of the commerce with these two nations,
about two thousand years ago the richest and most powerful
of Asia, had carried on with Madagascar, where they
had settled in great numbers."</p>

<p>Whatever credit we may attach to these statements and
inferences, respecting the commerce of these islands before
they were visited by Europeans in the fifteenth century, it is
certain that, at this period, an extensive trade was established
at Malacca, Acheen, and Bantam, then the great emporiums
of the Eastern Archipelago. Hither the rich produce of
Sumatra, Borneo, and the Moluccas, was conveyed in the
small trading craft of the country, and exchanged for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Vol I Pg 213]</a></span>
produce of India and China. These ports were then filled
with vessels from every maritime state of Asia, from the Red
Sea to Japan. The Portuguese, who preceded the Dutch in
India, and who had fixed upon <em>Goa</em>, on the coast of Malabar,
as the capital of their eastern settlements, selected Malacca
as the most convenient station for conducting and protecting
their trade with the islands, and erected it into a secondary
capital. The Dutch finding this desirable station pre-occupied,
and being foiled in their attempts to dislodge their
rivals, first established a commercial settlement at Bantam,
and subsequently subdued by force of arms the neighbouring
province of <em>Jákatra</em>, (or <em>Jokárta</em>), on which, as will be afterwards
mentioned, they built the fortress, the city, and the
port of Batavia.</p>

<p>Nor was it without reason that they selected this spot for
the capital of their new empire. "What the Cape of Good
Hope is," says Adam Smith, "between Europe and every
part of the East Indies, Batavia is between the principal
countries in the East Indies. It lies upon the most frequented
road from Hindustan to China and Japan, and
is nearly about midway on that road. Almost all the ships,
too, that sail between Europe and China, touch at Batavia;
and it is, over and above all this, the centre and principal
mart of what is called the country trade of the East Indies,
not only of that part of it which is carried on by Europeans,
but of that which is carried on by the native Indians, and
vessels navigated by the inhabitants of China and Japan,
of Tonquin, of Malacca, of Cochin China, and the Island
of Celebes, are frequently to be seen in its port. Such advantageous
situations have enabled these two colonies to
surmount all the obstacles which the oppressive genius of
an exclusive company may have occasionally opposed to
their growth: they have enabled Batavia to surmount the
additional disadvantage, of perhaps the most unwholesome
climate in the world."</p>

<p>It would be as difficult to describe in detail the extent of
the commerce enjoyed by Java<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, at the period of the establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Vol I Pg 214]</a></span>of the Dutch in the eastern seas, as it would be painful
to point out how far, or to show in what manner, that commerce
was interfered with, checked, changed in its character,
and reduced in its importance, by the influence of a withering
monopoly, the rapacity of avarice armed with power, and the
short-sighted tyranny of a mercantile administration. To
convey an idea of the maritime strength of the native princes
anterior to this date, as giving a criterion by which to judge
of the trade of their subjects, it may be sufficient to state that
warlike expeditions, consisting of many hundred vessels, are
often reported to have been fitted out against Borneo, Sumatra,
and the peninsula. In the art of ship-building, however,
they do not appear to have advanced beyond the construction
of that sort of vessel adapted to the navigation
of their own smooth seas, and now to be met with in all their
ports and harbours; nor do they seem to have had any knowledge
of maritime geography beyond the shores of their own
Archipelago, and the information which they gained from the
reports of the Arabs, or the traditions of their own more
adventurous ancestors. This circumstance would lead us to
infer that the trade of Java was carried on chiefly in foreign
vessels, and through the enterprize of foreign adventurers.
The habits of the people had become agricultural; they had
nearly deserted an element which they had no powerful
temptation to traverse, and on which they could reap little,
compared with what they could draw from the fertility of their
own territory. Leaving therefore their ports to be filled, and
their commodities to be carried away by the <em>Maláyus</em>, the
<em>Búgis</em>, the Indians, the Chinese, and the Arabs, they for the
most part contented themselves with enjoying the advantages
of a trade, in which they incurred no chance of loss; and
thus, though their own country yielded neither gold nor
jewels, they are said to have been plentifully supplied with
these and other valuable articles on their own shores, in
exchange for the produce of their tranquil industry and their
fertile soil. This kind of traffic was almost entirely annihilated,
or at least very much diverted from its ancient course,
by the restrictive system of Dutch colonial policy. Some
branches of it were, it must be allowed, partially encouraged
by the influx of European capital and the demand for particular
articles which bear a high price in the European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Vol I Pg 215]</a></span>
market; but this was an inadequate compensation for the loss
of that commerce, which may be said to be as much the
growth of the country as any of its indigenous plants. In
order to show to what insignificance it was reduced under
Dutch oppression, and what tendency it has to improve under
a better system, it is only necessary to compare its state
during the latter years of the Dutch government, before the
blockade, and afterwards during the short interval of British
administration. For the first of these purposes, I have drawn,
in the introduction to this work, a short sketch of the condition
of the Dutch East India Company, for a considerable period
previous to our arrival; and I now proceed to give some
account of the external and internal trade of Java, as it
existed at the time when we restored it to its former
masters.</p>

<p>The extent of this commerce, since the establishment of
the British government, and since a greater freedom of trade
has been allowed, may, for a want of a better criterion,
be estimated from the amount of tonnage employed since the
beginning of the year 1812, at which period the operations
of the military expedition had ceased, and the transports were
discharged.</p>

<p>In the year 1812, the number of square-rigged vessels
which entered the port of Batavia amounted to 239, and their
aggregate tonnage to 48,290 tons, and in the same year the
native craft amounted to 455 vessels, or 7,472 tons, or together
55,762 tons. The quantity cleared out during the same year
was 44,613 tons of shipping, and 7,762 of native craft,
making together 52,375.</p>

<p>In the year 1813, the number of square-rigged vessels was
288, and the tonnage 51,092, the native craft amounting to
796 vessels, or 13,214 tons, or together 64,306 tons.</p>

<p>In 1814, three hundred and twenty-one ships, or 63,564
tons, cleared out with 568 native vessels, or 9,154 tons,
shewing the total tonnage of Batavia during this year to
have amounted to 72,718 tons.</p>

<p>The returns for the following year have not been received,
but they are estimated to exceed either of the two former

cargoes, the produce of Java, to the London market.</p>

<p>The average annual tonnage which cleared out from the
port of <em>Surabáya</em>, for the three last years, amounted to about
thirty thousand tons, and the native tonnage trading to the
neighbouring port of <em>Grésik</em> is estimated to have even exceeded
that quantity.</p>

<p>By an official return made in March 1816, it appears that
the total quantity of tonnage in vessels boarded on their passage
through the Straits of <em>Súnda</em>, amounted in 1812 to
45,000 tons; in 1813, to 56,000 tons; in 1814, to 64,000
tons; and in 1815, to 130,000 tons; to which, adding a third
for vessels which passed without being boarded, the whole
amount of tonnage for these four years, would be 390,000, the
quantity in the fourth of these years being nearly triple that
of the first.</p>

<p>The commerce of Java may be considered under the two
general divisions of the native and the European, the former
including the internal and coasting trade, with that of the
Malayan Archipelago in general; the latter comprehending
that carried on by Europeans and Americans with India,
China and Japan, Africa, America, and Europe.</p>

<p>Java has already been described as a great agricultural
country. It has long been considered as the granary of the
Eastern Islands.</p>

<p>The southern coast is for the most part inaccessible, and
seldom visited by traders; but along the north coast there are
no less than thirteen principal ports, besides numerous other
intermediate and less considerable ones, frequented by native
vessels at all seasons of the year. Many of these are sheltered,
and form safe harbours in all weather, as <em>Bantam</em>, <em>Batavia</em>,
<em>Rembáng</em>, <em>Grésik</em>, and <em>Surabáya</em>. Even where the vessels
lie in an open roadstead, the wind is seldom sufficiently strong
to render the anchorage unsafe. Several of the rivers are
navigable for many miles into the interior, and most of them
are capable of receiving native vessels into the heart of the
town, through which they generally run; but the rivers of
Java, as well as those of the eastern coast of Sumatra and the
western coast of Borneo, are for the most part obstructed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Vol I Pg 218]</a></span>
their entrance by extensive bars, which preclude the admission
of vessels of any very considerable burthen. Piers have been
run out in many places, to remedy this inconvenience; but in
consequence of the quantity of soil annually carried down,
the bars or banks are continually increasing, and in some
places, as at <em>Tégal</em>, have nearly blocked up the communication
between the rivers and the sea.</p>

<p>The produce and manufactures of the country are conveyed
from one district to another and to these maritime capitals,
either by water or land carriage. The principal navigable
rivers to the westward, are those which disembogue themselves
below <em>Táng'ran</em>, <em>Kráwang</em>, and <em>Indramáyu</em>, and the
produce brought down by them is usually conveyed to Batavia.
To the eastward, the great <em>Sólo</em> river, which is navigable from
<em>Súra-kérta</em>, affords, with the <em>Kedíri</em>, the principal and only
outlets from the native provinces by water towards the northern
coast. Down the former, which empties itself by several
mouths, near <em>Grésik</em>, into the great harbour of <em>Surabáya</em>,
during the rains, large quantities of the produce of the richest
provinces of the interior are conveyed. The boats employed,
which are of considerable burthen, return with cargoes of salt.
This river runs through many valuable teak forests, and consequently
affords the means of easy transport for the timber;
an advantage which is also derived from several smaller rivers
on the northern coast, particularly in the neighbourhood of
the principal building yards. Facilities of the same kind are
also found at most of the sea ports, which are generally seated
on rivers passing through forests in the interior, down which
timber required for house-building and the construction of
small craft is floated with ease. An inland navigation is
carried on to a considerable extent, by means of small canals,
in <em>Demák</em> and some of the neighbouring districts, where it is
common, even during the harvest, at the driest season of the
year, to observe innumerable boats with their light sails crossing
an extensive, flat, and highly cultivated country and traversing
the corn-fields in various directions. In the rich and
fertile delta of <em>Surabáya</em>, the whole produce of the adjacent
country is conveyed by water carriage, generally on light
rafts constructed of a few stems of the plantain tree.</p>

<p>Goods not conveyed by water carriage, are usually carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Vol I Pg 219]</a></span>
on the backs of oxen or horses, or on the shoulders of men and
women, carts not being generally used, except in the western
districts, where the population is thin, or in some of the
more eastern districts, particularly those recently under
Chinese direction. The cart of the western districts, termed
<em>pedáti</em>, is of clumsy construction, running on two large solid
wheels, from five to six feet in diameter, and from one to two
inches broad, on a revolving axle, and drawn by two buffaloes.
It is the ordinary conveyance of goods to the capital, within a
range of about sixty miles from Batavia.</p>

<p>Few countries can boast of roads, either of a better description,
or of a greater extent, than some of those in Java. A
high post road, passable for carriages at all seasons of the
year, runs from <em>Anyer</em>, on the western side of Bantam, to
within twenty miles of <em>Bányuwángi</em>, the eastern extremity of
the Island, being a distance of not less than eight hundred
English miles. Along this road, at intervals of less than five
miles, are regular post stations and relays of carriage horses.
A portion of it towards the west, which proceeded into the interior,
and passed over some high and mountainous tracts,
was found to occasion great delay and inconvenience to passengers,
and to impose an oppressive duty upon those inhabitants,
who, residing in the neighbourhood, were obliged to
lend the use of their cattle, or the assistance of their personal
labour, to aid carriages in ascending the steeps; this part of
the line has therefore been abandoned, and a new road has recently
been constructed along the low lands, from <em>Batavia</em> to
<em>Chéribon</em>, by which not only the former inequalities are
avoided, but a distance of fifty miles is saved. This route is
now so level, that a canal might easily be cut along its side,
and carried on nearly through all the maritime districts of the
eastward, by which the convenience of inland navigation
might be afforded them, for conveying the commodities continually
required for the consumption and exportation of the
capital. Besides this main road from one extreme to the
other, there is also a high military road, equally well constructed,
which crosses the Island from north to south, leading
to the two native capitals of <em>Súra-kérta</em> and <em>Yúg'ya-kérta</em>,
and consequently to within a few miles of the South Sea.
Cross roads have also been formed wherever the convenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Vol I Pg 220]</a></span>
or advantage of Europeans required them; and there is no
part of the Island to which the access is less difficult. But it
is not to be concluded, that these communications contribute
that assistance to agriculture or trade on Java, which such
roads would afford in Europe: their construction has, on the
contrary, in many instances, been destructive to whole districts,
and when completed by his own labour, or the sacrifice
of the lives of his neighbours, the peasant was debarred from
their use, and not permitted to drive his cattle along them,
while he saw the advantages they were capable of yielding reserved
for his European masters, that they might be enabled
to hold a more secure possession of his country. They were
principally formed during the blockade of the Island, and
were intended to facilitate the conveyance of stores, or the
passage of troops necessary for its military defence. The inhabitants,
however, felt the exclusion the less, as good inferior
roads were often made by the side of these military roads, and
bye-roads branched off through all parts of the country, so that
the internal commerce met with no impediment for the want
of direct or convenient lines of communication.</p>

<p>Nor is it discouraged by the want of understood or established
places of exchange. Bazars or public markets (here
called <em>pékan</em>) are established in every part of the country, and
usually held twice a-week, if not oftener. The market days
are in general regulated by what are called <em>pásar</em> days, being
a week of five days, similar to that by which the markets in
South America appear to be regulated. At these markets are
assembled frequently some thousands of people, chiefly women,
on whom the duty devolves of carrying the various productions
of the country to these places of traffic. In some districts, extensive
sheds are erected for the accommodation of the people;
but, in general, a temporary covering of thatch, to shelter them
from the rays of the sun, is made for the occasion, and thought
sufficient. Where the market is not held within a town of
considerable size, the assemblage usually takes place under a
large tree, in a spot occupied from immemorial usage for that
purpose. In these markets there are regular quarters appropriated
for the grain merchant, the cloth merchant, venders of
iron, brass, and copper ware, and dealers in the various small
manufactures of the country, as well as those of India, China,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Vol I Pg 221]</a></span>
and Europe. Prepared eatables of every kind, as well as all
the fruits and vegetables in request, occupy a considerable
space in the fair, and find a rapid sale. In the more extensive
bazars, as at <em>Sólo</em>, the <em>kris</em> handle makers have their particular
quarter, and in an adjoining square, horses and oxen
are exposed for sale.</p>

<p>Small duties are generally levied in these bazars, the collection
of which was formerly farmed out to Chinese; but it
being found that they exacted more than the settled or authorized
rate, and that they contrived, by means of the influence
which their office conferred, to create a monopoly in
their own favour, not only of the articles of trade but of many
of the necessaries of life, that system has latterly been relinquished
wherever practicable, and government has taken
the management of that portion of the public revenue into its
own hands. In the bazars, accordingly, regulated under the
immediate superintendence of its officers, extensive sheds are
built, and a small compensation only is required for the use of
them by those who there intend to expose their goods for sale.
This duty is collected at the entrance into the market-place,
and is taken in lieu of all other taxes or customs whatever,
formerly levied on the transit or sale of native commodities.
It is to be regretted, that this improvement had not been extended
to the native provinces, where every article of produce
and manufacture is still impeded in its progress through the
country to the place of consumption or export, by toll duties
and other impolitic exactions, and charged on its arrival there
with heavy bazar duties, to the discouragement of industry
and enterprize, and the depression of agriculture and trade,
in a degree not compensated by a proportionate benefit to the
revenue<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Vol I Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost all the inland commerce, beyond what is thus carried
on though the medium of bazars, is under the direction of the
Chinese, who, possessing considerable capital, and frequently
speculating on a very extensive scale, engross the greater part
of the wholesale trade, buy up the principal articles of export
from the native grower, convey them to the maritime capitals,
and in return supply the interior with salt, and with the principal
articles imported from the neighbouring islands, or from
foreign countries. The industry of the Javans being directed
almost exclusively to the cultivation of the soil, they are satisfied
if they can find an immediate market for their surplus
produce; and the Chinese, from their superior wealth and enterprize,
offering them this advantage without interfering with
their habits, have obtained almost a monopoly of their produce,
and an uncontrolled command of their market for foreign
commodities.</p>

<p>The trade carried on by native vessels along the coast, with
the neighbouring islands, and with the peninsula of Malacca,
has been even more shackled than that placed under the impolitic
restraints of interior regulation; and if it exists now to
any considerable extent, it is owing only to the great natural
advantages that attend it. Independently of the dangers to
which the peaceable unprotected trader has so long been exposed,
from the numerous pirates who infest the Eastern Seas,
and who for many years have been in the habit of annually
sweeping the coast of Java, the various restrictions, penalties,
and prohibitions established by the Dutch government, in
order to insure their own monopoly, closed all the minor ports
against him.</p>

<p>Among these restrictions, none operated more forcibly to
prejudice the native trade than the rigid and enforced monopoly
of the teak timber; an article of produce with which Java
abounds, and of which the shipping of the Archipelago had,
from time immemorial, been principally constructed. The
facilities for building and repairing vessels along the coast,
while the sale of timber was unrestricted, not only allowed a
more abundant supply of shipping at a cheap rate for the convenience
of the native trader, but attracted the beneficial visits
and the intercourse of foreigners, and encouraged a species of
trade, which under the recent system has been lost. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Vol I Pg 223]</a></span>
<em>Búgis</em> and Arabs of the different eastern ports, navigating in
large vessels, were induced to give them an annual repair on
Java; and rather than depart in ballast, frequently carried out
cargoes, the profits of which alone, independently of their
refit, would not have been sufficient to tempt them to the
speculation. These adventurers not only imported considerable
quantities of gold-dust to defray the expence of their repairs,
but many other articles the produce of the Malayan
islands; for which they in return exported large quantities of
salt and other bulky commodities, which would otherwise
hardly repay their freight. In consequence of the stop put to
this kind of intercourse, the Malayan States were principally
supplied with salt from Siam and the Coromandel coast, or
manufactured the article for themselves, while an accumulating
undemanded surplus for many years remained on Java unsaleable.
Of the nature of the restrictions under which the
internal commerce and the native trade in general were placed
until lately, some idea may be formed from the amount of the
duties which were exacted at <em>Chéribon</em> prior to the introduction
of the land revenue settlement<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>These, with still heavier and more vexatious duties and exactions,
were levied on trade in other districts of the island.
Constant requisitions were made by the Dutch government
for the services of native vessels, at rates far below a just compensation
to the owner, and the native traders were forbidden
to traffic in any of the articles of Dutch monopoly; considerations
which incline us rather to express our surprize, that
there should have been any native trade at all, than that there
should be so little as now exists.</p>

<p>The coasting trade is carried on in vessels belonging chiefly
to Chinese, Arabs, and <em>Búgis</em> (natives of Celebes), and in
smaller Malayan <em>práhus</em><a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>. The enterprize of the Arabs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Vol I Pg 224]</a></span>Chinese, and <em>Búgis</em> is very conspicuous. They are in general
fair traders; and Europeans acquainted with their several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Vol I Pg 225]</a></span>
characters can rely on their engagements, and command
their confidence. Many of them, particularly the <em>Búgis</em>, are
possessed of very large capital.</p>

<p>By means of the coasting trade, the produce of the maritime
and inland districts is conveyed to <em>Batavia</em>, <em>Semárang</em>, and
<em>Surabáya</em>, the principal ports of consumption and exportation;
and in return those districts receive iron, steel, and other articles
of foreign produce and manufacture from abroad. The
western districts being but thinly inhabited, do not yield a
sufficient supply for the consumption of Batavia; and on this
account, as well as its being the principal mart of foreign
commerce, the trade of the eastern districts is attracted to it,
in a higher degree than to any of the other great towns in their
own immediate neighbourhood: but owing to the unhealthiness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Vol I Pg 226]</a></span>of the climate, the loss occasioned by the paper money,
which the native traders of other islands could never understand,
and the various vexations and impositions to which they
were subjected, these latter invariably prefer the more eastern
ports of <em>Semárang</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>, or rather <em>Grésik</em>, in the immediate
vicinity of the latter, which has always been the principal
establishment and residence of the Arabs.</p>

<p>The <em>Búgis</em> import into Java from the other islands, Malayan
camphor, tortoise-shell, edible birds'-nests, bees'-wax, cloth
called <em>sárongs</em>, of a very strong texture, their own manufacture,
and gold dust, which they lay out in the purchase of opium,
iron, steel, Europe chintzes and broad cloth, and Indian piece
goods, besides tobacco, rice, salt, and other productions and
manufactures of Java, with which they return eastward during
the favourable monsoon.</p>

<p>The Arabs navigate square-rigged vessels, from fifty to five
hundred tons burden. The Chinese also have many brigs,
besides their peculiar description of vessels called junks, as
well as native-built <em>práhus</em>. They extend their voyages to
Sumatra, the Straits of Malacca, and eastward as far as the
Moluccas and Timor, collecting birds'-nests, camphor, <em>bich de
mar</em>, and other articles, making Java a grand depôt for the
produce of all the countries to which they resort. Throughout
the whole of Java, trade is usually conducted by the
Chinese: many of them are very rich, and their means are
increased by their knowledge of business, their spirit of enterprize,
and their mutual confidence.</p>

<p>If a cargo arrives too extensive for the finances of one
individual, several Chinese club together, and purchase the
goods, each dividing according to his capital. In this manner
a ready market is always open at Java, without the assistance
of European merchants, and strangers are enabled to transact
their business with little trouble or risk.</p>

<p>The objections which have been made to the political
influence of the Chinese and Arabs in the Eastern Islands,
do not equally apply to them as traders. In this last capacity,
and subject to regulations which prevent them from uniting
the power of a chief with the temper of a merchant, and
despotism with avarice, their value cannot be too highly rated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Vol I Pg 227]</a></span>
The persevering industry and speculative turn of the Chinese
is too well known to need description; and the Arab traders
are here what they are all over the world, keen, intelligent,
and adventurous. The <em>Búgis</em> have long been distinguished
among the Eastern Islands for the extent of their speculations
and the fairness of their dealing.</p>

<p>Java exports, for the consumption and use of the other
islands of the Archipelago, including the Malayan ports on
the peninsula, rice, a variety of vetches, salt, oil, tobacco,
timber, Java cloths, brass ware, and a variety of minor articles,
the produce of her agriculture and manufactures, besides occasionally,
as the market admits, a considerable quantity of
European, Indian, and Chinese goods. Almost the only articles
for which Java is at present dependent on its neighbours
are <em>gúmbir</em>, imported from Lingen (<em>Ling'ga</em>) and Rhio,
where it is produced to the annual amount of from twenty to
thirty thousand <em>píkuls</em>,​&mdash;and <em>pámur</em>, the metal used for
damasking the Javan <em>krís</em>, of which a small quantity is imported
from <em>Biliton</em> and <em>Célebes</em>, where alone it is found.
The following articles, the exclusive produce of the Eastern
Islands, are collected at its principal ports, for re-exportation
to India, China, and Europe: tin, from <em>Bánka</em>; gold-dust,
diamonds, camphor, benjamin and other drugs, edible birds'-nests,
<em>bich de mar</em>, rattans, bees'-wax, tortoise-shell, and
dyeing woods, from Borneo and Sumatra; sandal and other
fine woods, nutmegs, cloves and mace, coarse, wild and
damaged spices, <em>káyu-púti</em> and other pungent oils, from the
Moluccas; horses and sapan wood, from <em>Sumbáwa</em>; <em>Búgis</em>
cloths, and many collections for the Chinese market, from
Célebes. Cloths are also sometimes imported from <em>Báli</em>, and
pepper is collected at <em>Bánjermásin</em>, on Borneo, and from
several of the Malayan states.</p>

<p>The tin brought to Java is almost exclusively from the
mines of <em>Bánka</em>. This metal is also exported from several
of the other islands, and from the peninsula of Malacca,
whence these countries have been considered the <em>Temala</em> of
Ptolemy, <em>timáh</em> being the Malayan word for tin; but the
quantity obtained from all other sources falls far short of
what is procured on <em>Bánka</em>, which exports to the annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Vol I Pg 228]</a></span>
amount of thirty thousand <em>píkuls</em>, or nearly forty thousand
cwt. of this metal. The mines on <em>Bánka</em> are worked by
Chinese, who deliver the metal into the government stores in
slabs, at the rate of about eight Spanish dollars the <em>píkul</em>, of
one hundred and thirty-three pounds and a quarter.</p>

<p>A very extensive branch of trade is carried on by a direct
communication between Java and China, entirely upon Chinese
capital, in a description of vessels called junks. From
eight to ten of these vessels arrive annually from Canton and
Amoi, with cargoes of teas, raw silk, silk piece goods, varnished
umbrellas, iron pots, coarse china-ware, sweetmeats,
nankeen, paper, and innumerable minor articles, particularly
calculated for the Chinese settlers. They are from three to
eight hundred tons burthen, and sail at stated periods, generally
reaching Batavia with the north-east monsoon, about
the month of January. Of all the imports from China, that
which produces the most extensive effects on the commercial
and political interests of the country is the native himself:
besides their cargoes, these junks bring a valuable import of
from two to five hundred industrious natives in each vessel.
These emigrants are usually employed as coolies or labourers
on their first arrival; but, by frugal habits and persevering
industry, they soon become possessed of a little property,
which they employ in trade, and increase by their prudence
and enterprize. Many of them, in course of time, attain
sufficient wealth to render themselves independent, and to
enable them to remit considerable accumulations yearly to
their relations in China. As these remittances are generally
made in the valuable articles, such as birds'-nests, Malayan
camphor, <em>bich de mar</em>, tin, opium, pepper, timber, leather
hides, indigo, gold and silver, the return cargoes of these
vessels amount to an almost incredible value.</p>

<p>The quantity of edible birds'-nests alone, annually exported
from Java to China on vessels of this description, is estimated
at not less than two hundred <em>píkuls</em>, of which by far the
largest proportion is the produce of the Javan rocks and hills.
It is well known that these are the nests of a species of
swallow (hirundo esculenta) common in the Malayan islands,
and in great demand for the China table. Their value as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Vol I Pg 229]</a></span>
luxury, in that empire, has been estimated on importation to
be weight for weight equal with silver. The price which
these nests of the best quality have of late years brought in
the Canton and Amoi market, has been forty Spanish dollars
per <em>káti</em>, of rather more than a pound and a quarter English.
They are usually classed into first, second, and third sorts,
differing in price from forty to fifteen Spanish dollars, and
even to ten and less for the most ordinary. The price in the
Batavian market rises as the period for the departure of the
junks approaches; but as the principal produce of Java is
still a monopoly in the hands of government, it is difficult to
fix the price at which they might be sold under other circumstances.
Generally speaking, however, they sell throughout
the Eastern Islands considerably lower than they are calculated
to do in China, which may be accounted for by the
perishable nature of the commodity, and the great care necessary
to preserve them from the damp, as well as from breakage.
On this account, they are seldom bought by European traders.
Birds'-nests consigned by the Javan government to the Canton
factory in 1813, sold to the amount of about fifty <em>píkuls</em>,
at an average rate of about twenty dollars per <em>kati</em>: but this
was at a period when the China markets were unusually low.</p>

<p>The quantity of birds' nests obtained from the rocks called
<em>Kárang bólang</em>, on the southern coast of Java, and within the
provinces of the native princes, is estimated, one year with
another, at a hundred <em>píkuls</em>, and is calculated to afford an
annual revenue to the government of two hundred thousand
Spanish dollars. The quantity gathered besides by individuals,
on rocks and hills belonging to them, either in private
property or held by farm from the government, in other parts
of the island, may amount to fifty <em>píkuls</em>; making the extent
of this export not less than one hundred and fifty <em>píkuls</em>,
besides the amount of the collections from the other islands
of the Archipelago.</p>

<p>In the Malayan islands in general, but little care is taken of
the rocks and caverns which produce this dainty, and the nests
procured are neither so numerous nor so good as they otherwise
would be. On Java, where perhaps the birds are fewer, and
the nests in general less fine than those to be met with in
some of the more Eastern Islands, both the quantity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Vol I Pg 230]</a></span>
quality have been considerably improved by European management.
To effect this improvement, the caverns which the
birds are found to frequent are cleansed by smoking and the
burning of sulphur, and the destruction of all the old nests.
The cavern is then carefully secured from the approach of
man, the birds are left undisturbed to form their nests, and
the gathering takes place as soon as it is calculated that the
young are fledged. If they are allowed to remain until eggs
are again laid in them, they lose their pure colour and transparency,
and are no longer of what are termed the first sort.
They are sometimes collected so recently after their formation,
that time has not been given for the bird to lay or hatch her
eggs in them, and these nests are considered as the most
superior; but as the practice, if carried to any extent, would
prevent the number of the birds from increasing, it is seldom
resorted to, where the caverns are in the possession of those
who have a permanent interest in their produce. Much of
their excellence and peculiar properties, however, depend on
the situation of the place in which they are formed. It has
often been ascertained, for instance, that the same bird forms
a nest of somewhat different quality, according as it constructs
it in the deep recesses of an unventilated and damp cavern,
or attaches it to a place where the atmosphere is dry, and the
air circulates freely. The nature of the different substances
also to which they are fixed, seems to have some influence
on their properties. The best are procured in the deepest
caverns, (the favourite retreat of the birds), where a nitrous
dampness continually prevails, and where being formed
against the sides of the cavern, they imbibe a nitrous taste,
without which they are little esteemed by the Chinese. The
principal object of the proprietor of a birds'-nest rock is to
preserve sufficient numbers of the swallows, by not gathering
the nests too often, or abstracting those of the finer kinds in
too great numbers, lest the birds should quit their habitations
and emigrate to a more secure and inaccessible retreat. It is
not unusual for a European, when he takes a rock under his
superintendence, after ridding it of the old nests and fumigating
the caverns, to allow the birds to remain undisturbed,
two, three, or even more years, in order that they may multiply
for his future advantage. When a birds'-nest rock is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Vol I Pg 231]</a></span>
once brought into proper order, it will bear two gatherings
in the year: this is the case with the rocks under the care of
the officers of government at <em>Kárang bólang</em>.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of the rocks are usually found a few persons
accustomed from their infancy to descend into these caverns,
in order to gather the nests; an office of the greatest risk
and danger, the best nests being sometimes many hundred
feet within the damp and slippery opening of the rock. The
gatherers are sometimes obliged to lower themselves by ropes
(as at <em>Kárang bólang</em>) over immense chasms, in which the
surf of a turbulent sea dashes with the greatest violence,
threatening instant destruction in the event of a false step or
an insecure hold. The people employed by government for
this purpose were formerly slaves, in the domestic service of
the minister or resident at the native court. To them the
distribution of a few dollars, and the preparation of a buffalo
feast after each gathering, was thought sufficient pay, and
the sum thus expended constituted all the disbursements
attending the gathering and packing, which is conducted by
the same persons. This last operation is however carefully
superintended by the resident, as the slightest neglect would
essentially deteriorate the value of the commodity<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>Although the Malayan camphor, which is the exclusive
produce of Sumatra and Borneo, is much stronger than the
camphor from China, it has not yet been considered an
article of extensive export for the European market. It is
always, however, in the greatest demand in China, where it
is either consumed, or as has been supposed by some, it undergoes
a certain process previous to its re-exportation under
a different appearance. It is not known in what manner the
China camphor for the European market is prepared; and
unless the Malayan camphor is used in the composition, it
seems difficult to account for the constant demand for it in
China, whence it is never re-exported in its original state.
Whatever value may be set on the Chinese camphor, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Vol I Pg 232]</a></span>
exported from Japan is of a still superior quality, and more
in demand for the European market.</p>

<p><em>Bich de mar</em> is well known to be a dried sea slug used in
the dishes of the Chinese: it is known among the Malayan
Islands by the name of <em>trípang</em>, and collected on the shores
of nearly all the islands of the Archipelago. It usually sells
in China at from ten to fifty dollars per <em>píkul</em>, according to its
quality, but being an article still more perishable than the
birds'-nests, and very bulky and offensive, it seldom composes
the cargoes of European vessels. It would be very difficult
to ascertain the average price, as it varies according to the
difficulties experienced in collecting it, and the immediate
demand in the market, for its perishable nature will not
admit of the excess of one season being laid by to meet the
deficiency of another. It requires constant care on the
voyage, and a leaky vessel frequently loses a whole cargo.</p>

<p>Stic-lac, used in dying, is procured in many parts of Java,
and can easily be obtained in a quantity sufficient to meet the
demand. The insect which yields it abounds in the Bantam
districts, and the lac prepared is considered of good quality;
but it is not an article which appears to have attracted much
attention.</p>

<p>The trade between Java and China in vessels belonging to
Europeans, at present consists principally in carrying out tin,
pepper, spices, rattans, and betel-nut, for the China market,
and receiving in return a few articles of China produce in demand
for the European market, a balance of cash, and a supply
of manufactures required annually at Batavia; but it is calculated
that cotton, rice, and timber, which may be considered as
the staple produce of Java, might be exported to China with
advantage.</p>

<p>A small quantity of Javan cotton lately sent to China, was
sold at a higher rate than the ordinary prices of the cotton
from Western India<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. Cotton-yarn is an article sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Vol I Pg 233]</a></span>exported to China, but in the existing state of society on Java,
the exportation of the raw material is likely to be attended with
the greatest advantages. Some writers have estimated the capability
of Java to export raw cotton almost incredibly high,
but it must be admitted, that although the soil is not universally
favourable, yet few countries afford greater general
advantages for the cotton cultivation, it being practicable to
raise it to a great extent, without interfering with the general
grain produce of the country. It could be grown as a second
crop on the rice fields, being planted shortly after the harvest,
and attaining maturity before the season again comes round for
irrigating the lands. Nothing can convey a higher idea of the
richness of the soil of Java, and of the advantages of its climate,
than the fact, that during one half the year the lands
yield a rich and abundant crop of grain, more than sufficient
for the ordinary food of the population, and during the other
half a valuable staple, which affords the material for clothing
them, and opens in its manufacture a source of wealth and of
continual domestic industry through the year.</p>

<p>Enterprising individuals, merchants of Batavia, have not
been wanting to engage in the valuable fur trade, hitherto carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Vol I Pg 234]</a></span>on principally by the Americans, between Kamtschatka
and China. Mr. Timmerman Thyssen, an enlightened Dutch
gentleman, whose name for honourable dealing and extensive
business has always stood high among the merchants of Batavia,
has entered into more than one speculation of this kind.
Vessels fitted out from Batavia took in furs at Kamtschatka,
which were intended to be exchanged in China for dollars;
but the dangers of the passage in one instance, and the informality
of the papers in another, rendered this bold and promising
enterprize productive of but little pecuniary advantage.
Nothing, however, has occurred, to prove that the adventure
would not have fully answered its intention in time of peace,
the principal difficulties which attended and frustrated it
ceasing with the war.</p>

<p>Since the conquest a very extensive trade has been carried
on by the English country ships importing from Calcutta,
Madras, and Bombay, all kinds of piece goods, opium, and
other articles, the returns for which have been usually made
by bills, gold-dust, bees'-wax, tin, Japan camphor, sago, and
teak timber.</p>

<p>The piece goods of Western India have always formed an
extensive article of import into Java, and the annual value of
those latterly imported cannot well be estimated at less than a
million of dollars. Those generally meet a ready sale, at an
advance of from thirty to forty per cent. upon the prime cost in
India, and much more when the supply is scanty.</p>

<p>In consequence of these heavy and valuable importations,
the returns to Bengal were till lately made principally by bills,
obtainable either from government, or individuals desirous of
purchasing colonial produce for the European market by
means of funds in Western India. But there are also several
articles, which experience has proved well calculated for
making their returns direct to Bengal, particularly Japan copper
and teak timber. Java is known to abound with valuable
teak forests, and the quality of the wood has been considered
as superior to that of Pegu or the Malabar coast. The restrictions
under which this export was formerly placed as a government
monopoly, prevented its finding its way beyond the
immediate Dutch dependencies; but the extent to which it
was even then sent to the Moluccas, to Malacca, and to the Cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Vol I Pg 235]</a></span>
of Good Hope, where all the public buildings are constructed
of Javan teak, sufficiently attests the value and extent of the
forests, as well as the good quality and durability of the
wood. This valuable, but bulky article of export, is always
in demand for ship-building in Bengal, and has afforded to
the merchant a very liberal profit on exportation, after paying
the present government prices, which are calculated at something
above ten per cent. upon the actual expence of cutting
and dragging the timber from the forests to the port of exportation.
During the last two years, large ships have taken cargoes
to Bengal, and afforded very handsome profits. From the
neighbourhood of <em>Rémbáng</em>, where permission has been given
to individuals to cut the timber, on paying a duty of ten per
cent. on the estimated value when worked up, it has not only
been exported at a cheap rate to Bengal, but several ships
have been constructed of it, while along the whole line of coast,
from <em>Semárang</em> to <em>Grésik</em>, small vessels and country craft are
launched every month.</p>

<p>But although the direct trade with Bengal has thus been
always against Java, the demand for sugar in the Bombay
market always affords the means of a circuitous return of
capital. Large quantities of Javan sugar have been exported
to Bombay during the last four years, principally on the
returning ships in ballast touching at Batavia on their way
from China, and these cargoes have afforded considerable
profit. A lucrative trade in this article is also sometimes
carried on by the Arabs to the Red Sea, and particularly to
Mocha; but Arab traders, of sufficient capital for these
extensive speculations, have, by the effects of the former
monopoly on Java, long been driven out of the market, and
sufficient time has not been given for them to return.</p>

<p>The extensive produce of this fine island in sugar and
coffee of superior quality, and the pepper and various other
articles, either yielded by it or collected from the neighbouring
countries, such as sago, tin, Japan copper, spices,
elephants' teeth, sticklac, long pepper, cubebs, tortoise-shell,
gold, diamonds, Japan wood, ebony, rattans, indigo, &amp;c.
present fine subjects for commercial speculation to all parts of
Europe and America, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Mauritius;
and the more so, as from the extensive native and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Vol I Pg 236]</a></span>
European population, a very considerable and constant demand
exists for the produce and manufactures of Europe, not
only for the consumption and use of the island itself, but to
supply the neighbouring Malayan states by way of barter.</p>

<p>The quantity of sugar seems to depend almost entirely
upon the demand, and is likely at all times to equal it, few
countries affording equal advantages for its manufacture.
Owing to the want of a demand for this kind of produce, for
several years antecedent to the conquest, many of the manufactories
were discontinued; but since the trade has been
opened, and the demand renewed, many of them have again
commenced working, and the quantity produced in the year
1815 was not less than twenty thousand <em>píkuls</em>.</p>

<p>The manufacturers being no longer compelled to deliver
their produce to government, can afford to sell the sugar at
Batavia at from four to six Spanish dollars (or from twenty to
thirty shillings) per <em>píkul</em>, the quality being distinguished into
first, second, and third sorts, of which the first may be bought
in the market for exportation at six Spanish dollars per <em>píkul</em>,
or about twenty-five shillings the hundred-weight. The
quality of this sugar is altogether different from the sugar in
Bengal, and is said to be equal to that of Jamaica, being
manufactured in a great measure according to the same
process. While the European market is open for coffee and
other light articles, the sugar of Java is always in demand for
dead weight, and large quantities have recently been sold in
the London market as high as ninety and one hundred shillings
per hundred-weight<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Vol I Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>The quantity of coffee delivered to government in the year
1815, exceeded seventy thousand <em>píkuls</em>; about thirty thousand
<em>píkuls</em> more may have been exported by individuals, and
the produce is greatly on the increase<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Vol I Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>The Batavian arrack is well known in the European market,
and was at one time imported in considerable quantities into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Vol I Pg 239]</a></span>the continent of Europe. It is distilled in a great measure
from molasses, in which respect, as well as in the process employed,
it differs so materially from the arrack of continental
India, that it cannot with propriety be considered as the same
spirit: it is in fact vastly superior to it, and capable of competing
in the European market with the rum of the West
Indies. Its price at Batavia, where any quantity can at all
times be procured, is for the first sort about sixty Spanish dollars,
for the second sort fifty, and for the third thirty Spanish
dollars the leaguer; the first sort, which is above proof, thus
selling by the leaguer of one hundred and sixty gallons, at the
rate of about twenty-pence the gallon. In consequence of the
prohibitory duties against the importation of this article into
Great Britain or British India, this branch of commerce has
latterly declined, and many of the distilleries have been discontinued.</p>

<p>The Dutch possessions of Ceylon, the Cape of Good Hope,
and the Moluccas, dependent on the government of Batavia,
always received their principal supplies of rice from Java, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Vol I Pg 240]</a></span>considerable quantities have of late been occasionally exported
to those places, as well as the Coromandel coast, with
great advantage. During a scarcity of grain in England, the
Java rice has also found its way to that market<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>From Europe the most important imports, and those in constant
demand for the native population, are iron, steel, copper,
printed cottons of a peculiar pattern, and woollens. Of iron,
not less than from one thousand to fifteen hundred tons are
annually imported, which is worked up into the implements of
husbandry, and into the various instruments, engines, and utensils,
required in the towns and agricultural districts. The price
has varied, during the last four years, from six to twelve Spanish
dollars: the average has been about eight dollars per hundred
weight for the English, and about nine per hundred weight
for the Swedish iron. The small bar iron is always in demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Vol I Pg 241]</a></span>
in the market, in consequence of its convenience for working
up into the different implements required. Steel is also
in demand, to the extent of two or three hundred tons
annually.</p>

<p>English printed cottons, of peculiar patterns adapted to the
taste of the natives and Chinese, and white cotton sheeting
cloth, always meet a ready and extensive sale; but the great
objection to the former is the want of permanency in the
colours, a disadvantage which all the English printed cottons
labour under. A very extensive and valuable assortment of
these cottons, imitated after the Javan and Malayan patterns,
was recently imported into Java by the East India Company,
and on the first sale produced very good prices; but before a
second trial could be made, the natives had discovered that
the colours would not stand, and the remainder were no
longer in any demand. Would it not tend greatly to the improvement
of the British manufacture, and consequently
greatly extend the export, if the enquiries of scientific men in
India were directed, in a particular manner, to an observation
of the different dye-stuffs used in Asia, and to the manner followed
by the natives in different parts, for fixing the colours
and rendering them permanent?</p>

<p>Broad-cloths, velvets, glass ware, wines, and in short all
articles of consumption and use among Europeans, may on
Java be considered also, in a great measure, in demand by the
native population, who free from those prejudices which preclude
an expectation of the introduction of European manufacture
into Western India, generally indulge in them according
to their means. The climate of many parts of the Island
renders the broad-cloth, particularly at some seasons of the
year, an article of great comfort, and among the higher orders
it is usually, as with Europeans, worn as a jacket: sometimes
this is of velvet. A constant demand, limited only by the means
of the purchaser, is also daily increasing for gold-lace and the
other European manufactures used in dress, furniture, saddlery,
&amp;c.; it may therefore be easily conceived, to what an
extent the demand for these articles is likely to be carried,
among a native population of more than four millions and a
half of souls, advancing in wealth and intelligence.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to notice the extent of the articles re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Vol I Pg 242]</a></span>quired
from Europe by the European population, as they are
the same in all parts of India. The demand is, of course,
partially affected by the extent of the military force, and by
the wants of the officers; but where there is a permanent resident
European population, of not less than a thousand souls,
generally in good circumstances, it may be inferred that the
demand is always great.</p>

<p>A continual traffic is carried on between Batavia, the Isle of
France, and the Cape of Good Hope, by which the latter in
particular is supplied with timber, rice, oil, and a variety of
articles of consumption, the voyage being frequently effected
in five weeks. While the Bourbon coffee bore a higher price
in the European market, considerable quantities of coffee
were sent from Java to that island, and from thence re-exported
as Bourbon coffee.</p>

<p>The American trade was carried to the greatest extent
during the existence of the anti-commercial system of the
late French ruler, when American traders purchased the Java
coffee at the rate of eighteen Spanish dollars the <em>píkul</em> at
Batavia, and by a circuitous route imported it into France,
at an advance of one hundred per cent. During this period,
the purchases of the Americans in the market of Batavia
amounted in some years to nearly a million sterling, for which
they obtained principally sugar, coffee, and spices.</p>

<p>Having thus given some account of the internal and external
trade of Java as it at present exists, of the advantages
for an extensive commerce which it enjoys, of the articles
which it can supply for the consumption of other countries,
and those which it receives in return for its own consumption,
and of the places with which its dealings are or might be most
profitably conducted on both sides, I might now be expected
to enter into the history of that trade since the subjection of
the Island to the Dutch, the regulations enacted and enforced
by them, for restraining or directing it, and the fluctuations it
has undergone during two centuries of a rigid monopoly; but
this inquiry would lead me to swell this part of the work to a
disproportionate size. I shall now merely present my readers
with a few extracts from the orders made in 1767, and strictly
enforced throughout the Archipelago, for regulating the trade
and navigation of the dominions subject to Batavia, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Vol I Pg 243]</a></span>
a brief abstract of the amount of exports and imports during
some of the subsequent years.</p>

<p>"All persons whatever," says the first article of those
orders, "are prohibited, under <em>pain of death</em>, from trading
in the four fine kinds of spices, unless such spices shall be
first bought of the Company." Opium was placed under
the same restrictions, and enforced by the same penalty.
The exportation of pepper, tin, and Japan copper was prohibited,
unless bought for the Company; and the importation
of them not permitted, except for sale to the Company, under
the penalty of confiscation, and a fine of four times the value
of the article. The import and export of Surat silks and of
India cloths, were strictly prohibited under the same penalty.
White cotton yarn and all other sorts of it, <em>Semárang</em> arrack,
and unstamped gold, were prohibited from being exported
under the penalty of confiscation. No port was open to any
vessel coming from the northward or from the Moluccas, except
Batavia. No <em>práhu</em> or vessel was to carry any greater
quantity of gunpowder and shot, than might be permitted,
and regularly entered in the pass given to the party, under
penalty of confiscation of the vessel, <em>and the infliction of a
corporal punishment similar to that inflicted for theft</em>. All
persons belonging to the coast of Java were strictly prohibited
from sailing from any part of the coast where there was not a
Company's Resident. No navigation was allowed to be carried
on by the vessels of <em>Bánka</em> and <em>Bíliton</em>, except to <em>Palémbang</em>.
All navigation from Celebes and <em>Sumbáwa</em> was prohibited,
under pain of confiscation of the vessel and cargo.
No vessel from the latter place could pass Malacca, and the
Company's pass to proceed to <em>Siak</em> was given only once in a
year to three vessels from Batavia, two from the coast of Java,
and one from Chéribon. The China junks were only permitted
to trade at Batavia and <em>Bánjer-másin</em>. No trade or navigation
whatever was permitted beyond the west point of Bantam,
without a pass from Batavia. Such are the most important
of thirty-one articles of restriction, serving to shackle every
movement of commerce, and to extinguish every spirit of enterprize,
for the narrow selfish purposes of what may be called
the fanaticism of gain. After perusing them, the reader will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Vol I Pg 244]</a></span>
rather be inclined to think the following amount of the trade
too highly stated, than be surprised that it is so low.</p>

<p>The precious metals have always been a great article of
import into Java, as well as into the other regions of the East.
In 1770 there was imported into Java from Holland, cash and
bullion to the amount of 2,862,176 Java rupees<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>, and the sums
imported from other quarters in the same year, and raised by
bills of exchange on Holland, amounted to 1,419,565 rupees,
making in all 4,281,742, or more than half a million sterling.
The amount imported in that year was almost as great as that
in any subsequent year till 1803, when the importation of
precious metals was estimated at 7,617,122 rupees, or nearly
a million sterling. This period corresponds with that of the
greatest exportation of sugar by the Americans, who, no
doubt, imported the precious metals in exchange for their
cargoes, as the quantity brought from Holland in the same
year amounted only to 448,370 rupees. In the following year
(1804) the quantity imported was 6,499,001 rupees, of which
none at all came from the mother-country. In forty years,
from 1770 to 1810, the total of the imported precious metals
amounted to 118,607,472 Java rupees, or nearly three millions
annually upon an average. A great portion of this was re-exported
to India, China, and the Dutch possessions in the
Archipelago, to pay for the articles brought to Batavia for the
supply of the European demand. The quantity of goods imported
from all quarters of the globe, exclusive of cash and
bullion, amounted in the year 1770 to the value in Spanish
dollars of 2,350,316, and the exports to 3,318,161, leaving a
balance in favour of the exports of 867,845 Spanish dollars.
A great part of the exports was destined for Holland, and a
great part of the imports came from Holland. The imports
from Holland were again re-exported to China, Japan, the
Spice Islands, &amp;c. from which, and from Bengal, Ceylon, the
coasts of Coromandel and of Malabar, and the Cape of Good
Hope and other eastern countries, the other shipments came,
and to which the other exports proceeded. The profits on
the sale of that portion of the imports of 1770, disposed of in
the market of Batavia for the consumption of Java, are stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Vol I Pg 245]</a></span>at 7,895 Spanish dollars, so that, so far as the import trade
was concerned, Batavia only became the <em>entrepôt</em> between
the mother-country and her other possessions or stations of
commercial resort in the Indian seas. The exports of Java
almost every year exceeded the imports, as will appear from
official returns which follow.</p>

<p>There was, of course, a lamentable falling off in the foreign
trade of Java after the commencement of the war of the French
revolution: some of the best markets were almost entirely
closed to it, and the intercourse with the mother-country was
nearly destroyed. The total of exports to Holland and her
eastern possessions, from the year 1796 till 1806, amounted
in value to only 7,097,963 Spanish dollars; the imports to
3,073,894 Spanish dollars; leaving a surplus of exports of
4,024,069 Spanish dollars. The Americans began to frequent
the market of Batavia in 1798, and through them principally
was the trade carried on till the conquest of the Island by the
British, except during the short interval of the peace of
Amiens. No specie (with which Holland chiefly paid for her
eastern commodities) was imported from the mother-country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Vol I Pg 246]</a></span>
from 1795 downwards, except during 1802-3 and 1803-4,
during which there was only the very inconsiderable sum of
about half a million of rupees imported.</p>

<p>It is impossible to convey a just idea of the native or foreign
trade of Java, without adverting to the commercial and political
state of the other islands of the Archipelago. Of these it
may be stated generally, that the interior is possessed by the
natives, collected under leaders who have taken advantage of
the great extent of the country, in proportion to its population,
to render themselves independent of the lawful sovereign;
that the coast is occupied, in many places, either by pirates,
by some of the ruder tribes whom it is dangerous to invade,
or by adventurous traders, chiefly <em>Maláyus</em> and <em>Búgis</em>. These
traders arrive in well-armed vessels, which some of them remain
to protect; others travel up the country, not unfrequently
to the distance of a hundred miles, and at the change of the
monsoon return to their companions, charged either with plunder,
or with the fruits of a commerce carried on with the natives
at an exorbitant profit. The pirates, as they drive the
peaceable and honest trader from the coast, recruit their numbers
from among the seafaring men to whom he used to give
employment. The decay of commerce is accelerated; and
the natives retreat into the interior, where, for want of a
market, they cease to collect the rich productions of their
country, and rapidly sink into poverty and barbarism. The
sea and the coast remain a scene of violence, rapine, and
cruelty. The mouths of the rivers are held by lawless banditti,
who interrupt the trade of those who inhabit their banks,
and capture the vessels destined for the inland towns: the
bays and harbours are entirely within their power; and in
these smooth seas they are never driven a moment from their
stations, or diverted by danger from their predatory vigilance.
The sovereigns of the country have too little authority over
their nominal subjects; and their resources are too confined
for them to oppose any effectual resistance to these outrages.
All restraints are withdrawn by the divisions and weakness of
the native governments; and men, rendered desperate by the
experience of lawless violence, are induced to join in the system
of plunder against which they can find no protection.</p>

<p>This extensive, rich, and beautiful cluster of islands is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Vol I Pg 247]</a></span>
deprived of all the advantages which it might derive from the
sea with which it is surrounded; its harbours become the
retreats of marauders, instead of the resort of peaceful commerce;
its seafaring people are reduced to a state of nature.
Where force decides right, no sovereign is possessed of paramount
authority to sweep this pest from his shores; no vessel
is safe, no flag is respected. The trade is thus confined to
desperate adventurers only, to whom the existence of piracy is
more advantageous than the unmolested security of navigation,
as the danger which it creates drives away all competitors
of a less daring character, and gives them a monopoly
of these ports. It is too true, also, that European traders have
materially contributed to the strength of the pirates, by the
supply of arms and ammunition. At the port of <em>Sambas</em>,
European vessels had not dared to touch openly for twenty
years; but such means of resistance as the pirates were found
to possess in two recent attacks upon it, could never have been
collected without large supplies from British traders.</p>

<p>The small colonial craft, so necessary for the prosperity of
these regions, cannot without great risk venture beyond the
coast; while armed Malayan and Bugis <em>práhus</em>, and a few
European speculators, engross most of the trade.</p>

<p>The above observations apply more particularly to the coasts
of Borneo and the adjacent islands; but they are, in a great
measure, applicable to many parts of Sumatra. The unfortunate
king of Acheen, who has long been intimately connected
with the British establishments, is a young man of
estimable qualities, with a title ancient and undisputed, though
perhaps a weak prince. All his chiefs acknowledge his authority,
though none submit to his control. Native traders from
the coast of Coromandel, and Europeans from Pinang, frequent
every river; and the profit derived from their dealings
furnishes the inhabitants with inducements and means to
throw off their allegiance. The king, too feeble to reduce the
revolters, is only able to keep up a state of continual alarm
and warfare, to which the mutual jealousies among the petty
usurpers themselves mainly contribute. The trade of his dominions
is in a great measure carried on like smuggling, by
armed boats running out at a favourable moment, hiding themselves
from danger, or fighting their way through opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Vol I Pg 248]</a></span>
as occasion may require, and laying their account with making
up for frequent losses by exorbitant profits. In some
places, these almost independent bands are commanded by
Malabar <em>chuliahs</em>; and, in most instances, the petty chiefs
whom they elevate to authority are foreign vagrants. Those
places which, from their vicinity to the residence of the king,
are least able to resist his power, are supported in their
opposition by the interests of the English traders; and it
is not to be forgotten, that when he made a partial attempt
to regain his authority over all the neighbouring country, they
petitioned the European authority to prevent, by its interference,
his levying a duty upon his own subjects. The
petition was attended to; and the king was compelled, by the
command of strangers, to forego the only means by which he
could have preserved his dominions from anarchy and confusion.
At the period, therefore, when the resources of his
kingdom would have been unfolding themselves, by the improving
industry of a well-regulated population, it is falling
into decay, through the personal imbecility and political
weakness of the monarch; and, breaking into detached fragments,
is about to form as many separate principalities, as
formerly there were independent governments throughout all
the Archipelago<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>That there has been, at some time, a more extensive commerce
on the shores of the Archipelago is highly probable,
and that there might be cannot be doubted. The great
resources, vegetable and mineral, with which they abound,
such as spices, camphor, gold, and diamonds, and the facilities
which they enjoy for navigation, offer means and
inducements of the highest nature. The general character of
the people, also, as far as it can be ascertained, appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Vol I Pg 249]</a></span>
equally favourable to commercial intercourse. They are
represented as mild, inoffensive, not indisposed to industry,
free from any obstinate prejudices of superstition, and
altogether of a different temper from that of the few who
remain in a constant state of warfare on the coast.</p>

<p>Another favourable circumstance is the existence of sovereigns,
whose rights, however infringed, are in principle
acknowledged, and who have never been known to favour,
what must be considered the chief misfortune of these
countries, and the source of almost all the rest, the horrible
system of piracy. The evil is manifest, and the remedy
is not of difficult discovery. Were legitimate and acknowledged
sovereigns assisted in resuming their due authority,
piracy and rebellion might be destroyed, these shores would
be peopled with their native inhabitants, whose industry,
awakened and invited by the opening of a safe navigation to
the capitals, would in fleets of small vessels, so essential to
the prosperity of the Eastern settlements, bring the produce
of the interior down the innumerable rivers, and communicate
to countries, beyond the reach of foreign adventurers
the comforts of civilised life.</p>

<p>A few years of repose to these islands, and of safe uninterrupted
commerce, with its attendant blessings, would repay
with gain incalculable, what they now claim from the benevolence
and philanthropy, if not from the justice of Europeans,
who have so essentially contributed to their degradation.
If left neglected, without capital, without a safe
navigation, almost without laws, the government disunited,
the people groaning under vassalage and slavery, these races
must descend still further in the scale of degradation, until
scarcely a vestige will remain to vindicate the records of their
history; and their political existence will only be testified by
acts of piracy perpetrated on defenceless vessels, which from
accident or ignorance may visit their inhospitable shores.</p>

<p>In all their Eastern settlements, the favourite policy of the
Dutch seems to have been to depress the native inhabitants,
and give every encouragement to the Chinese, who, generally
speaking, are only itinerants and not children of the soil, and
who follow the almost universal practice of remitting the
fruits of their industry to China, instead of spending them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Vol I Pg 250]</a></span>
where they were acquired. The Chinese, in all ages equally
supple, venal, and crafty, failed not, at a very early period, to
recommend themselves to the speculating Hollanders. They
have, almost from the first, been their agents; and in the
island of Java, in particular, they acquired from them the
entire monopoly of the revenue farms and government contracts.
Many of the most respectable Dutch families were
intimately connected with the Chinese in their contracts and
speculations, and whole provinces had been sold in perpetuity
to some of them, the extensive population of which were
thus assigned over to their unfeeling oppression, for the purpose
of raising temporary supplies of money.</p>

<p>On Java, the Chinese have been generally left to their own
laws and the regulations of their own chiefs; and being, for
the most part, merely temporary residents in the country, they
devote themselves to the accumulation of wealth, without
being very scrupulous about the means of obtaining it: when,
therefore, they acquire grants of land, they generally contrive
to reduce the peasants speedily to the condition of slaves.
The improvement of the people, which was never much
attended to by the Dutch, was still less so by the Chinese,
and the oppression which they exercised in the vicinity of
Batavia had opened the eyes of the Dutch themselves. A
report of the Council of Batavia, a short time prior to the
landing of the English, accordingly states, that "although
the Chinese, as being the most industrious settlers, should
be the most useful, they on the contrary have become a
very dangerous people, and are to be considered as a pest
to the country; for which evil," they add, "there appears
to be no radical cure but their expulsion from the interior."
Wherever the Chinese formed extensive settlements in Java,
the native inhabitants had no alternative but that of abandoning
the district or becoming slaves of the soil. The monopolising
spirit of the Chinese was often very pernicious to
the produce of the soil, as may be seen even at this day in
the immediate vicinity of Batavia, where all the public
markets are farmed by them, and the degeneracy and poverty
of the lower orders are proverbial.</p>

<p>The Chinese of Batavia are a very numerous body, and
possess considerable wealth. They are active and industrious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Vol I Pg 251]</a></span>
enterprising and speculative in the highest degree in the
smallest or most extensive concerns, and equally well adapted
for trade or agriculture; but, at the same time, they are
cunning, deceitful, covetous, and restless, and exceedingly
unwarlike in their habits and dispositions. This is the character
given of them by Mr. Hogendorp, who, in considering
the injurious consequences of their extensive influence on
Java, has drawn a very just and able representation of it<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Vol I Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>In all the Malayan states, the Chinese have made the
greatest efforts to get into their hands the farming of the port
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Vol I Pg 253]</a></span>duties, and this has generally proved the ruin of the trade.
In addition to these circumstances it should be recollected,
that the Chinese, from their peculiar language and manners,
form a kind of separate society in every place where they
settle, which gives them a great advantage over every competitor
in arranging monopolies of trade. The ascendancy of
the Chinese requires to be cautiously guarded against and
restrained; and this, perhaps, cannot be better done, than by
bringing forward the native population, and encouraging them
in useful and industrious habits.</p>

<p>Some of these observations regarding the Chinese are, in a
high degree, applicable to the Arabs who frequent the Malayan
countries, and under the specious mask of religion
prey on the simple unsuspicious natives. The Chinese must,
at all events, be admitted to be industrious; but by far the
greater part of the Arabs are mere useless drones, and idle
consumers of the produce of the ground: affecting to be
descended from the Prophet and the most eminent of his followers,
when in reality they are commonly nothing better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Vol I Pg 254]</a></span>than manumitted slaves, they worm themselves into the
favour of the Malayan chiefs, and often procure the highest
offices under them. They hold like robbers the offices which
they have obtained as sycophants, and cover all with the
sanctimonious veil of religious hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Under the pretext of instructing the <em>Maláyus</em> in the principles
of the Mahometan religion, they inculcate the most
intolerant bigotry, and render them incapable of receiving
any species of useful knowledge. It is seldom that the East
is visited by Arabian merchants of large capital, but there are
numerous adventurers who carry on a coasting trade from port
to port, and by asserting the religious claims of Sheikh, generally
obtain an exemption from all port duties in the Malayan
states. They are also not unfrequently concerned in piracies,
and are the principal promoters of the slave-trade.</p>

<p>This may serve, in some degree, to illustrate the necessity
of establishing an equal and uniform system of port regulations
throughout the whole of the Malayan countries; for if
the Chinese, on the one hand, are permitted to farm import
and export duties in different ports, they have every facility
allowed them to form combinations, in order to secure a
monopoly to Chinese traders; and on the other hand, if the
Arabs, under religious pretexts, are entirely exempted from
duties, they may baffle all competition, and engross the trade
of the Malayan countries to the exclusion of European
traders altogether.</p>

<p>Let the Chinese and Arabs still trade to the eastward.
Without them, the trade would be reduced to less than one-third
of even what it is at present, for it is only through the
stimulus which they give to the industry of the country that
its resources are to be developed: but let their trade be regulated;
and above all, let them not be left in the enjoyment of
immunities and advantages, which are neither possessed by
Europeans, nor the indigenous inhabitants of the country.
Since the reduction of the Dutch influence in the East, several
of the ports formerly dependant on them have almost become
Arab colonies. The evil is obviously increasing every day,
and can only be checked by encouraging the native population,
and regulating on equal terms the duties of the Malayan
and other Eastern ports.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Vol I Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>In many other respects besides those which we have stated,
the commercial policy adopted by the Dutch, with regard to
the Eastern islands and the Malayan states in general, was
contrary to all principles of natural justice, and unworthy of
any enlightened and civilized nation<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Vol I Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>From authentic accounts it appears, that they attempted to
destroy and eradicate from a vast range of countries the most
advantageous produce of the land, in order to favour their own
petty traffic, and burnt a large proportion of the residue, in
order to keep up their monopoly price in Europe on a small
proportion of this produce. Against errors of this kind, it is
to be hoped the more enlightened policy of the present era
will be an effectual preventive; but there are others, so interwoven
with the interests of these islands, and so local in
their nature, that they may not so easily attract the attention
of the governing power.</p>

<p>One feature of the Dutch policy in the Eastern Isles seems
to have been the exclusion of all foreign trade, whether European
or native; excepting at certain specified ports under
their own immediate control. This policy was as much connected
with the general government of the country, as with
the commercial profits of the Company; for in an Archipelago
of such unparalleled extent, inhabited by tribes of such various
characters, formidable in a high degree from their very
want of civilization, it was necessary to bring forward some of
the most powerful and most favourably situated of these numerous
states, and to hold them answerable for the proceedings
of the several districts under their influence. Such views
gave rise to the establishment of certain regular and determined
trading ports, and led to the vigilant suppression of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Vol I Pg 257]</a></span>attempts at competition and independence on the part of the
inferior states.</p>

<p>Had this measure been combined with a liberal encouragement
of the home trade, as it may be denominated, between
these privileged ports established by the Dutch, and the various
countries under their influence, little doubt can be entertained
that it would have tended materially to promote the
civilization and general improvement of all the neighbouring
nations. Very different, however, was the object of the Dutch
agreements with the different rajas of the Eastern Archipelago.
In some cases it was to secure a monopoly of all the
tin, pepper, camphor, and other saleable articles produced in
their dominions; in others it was to bind the chiefs themselves
to destroy the only saleable articles that their country
could furnish, lest the monopoly price of the Dutch should be
injured by a greater quantity of such produce being brought
to market. The Dutch genius, though exclusively devoted to
commerce, has never yet been able to discover the truth of
the maxim, that in the long run it may be as gainful "to make
small profits on large sales as large profits on smaller sales;"
their policy, on the contrary, has not been inaptly compared
to a man putting out one of his eyes to strengthen the sight of
the other.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, that the line of conduct pursued by
the English towards the Malayan nations, had by no means
been of a conciliatory or prepossessing character. Our intercourse
with them had been carried on almost exclusively
through the medium of adventurers little acquainted with
either the country or people, who have been frequently more
remarkable for boldness than principle<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. Indeed, the want
of any settled basis of traffic, and the long indifference of
the British government to the complaints of either party,
had produced so many impositions, reprisals, piracies, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Vol I Pg 258]</a></span>murders, that any eastern trader must have felt himself very
much in the situation of a dealer in spirits, tobacco, and
blankets, among the Indians of North America. It was the
remark of Mr. Farquhar, than whom no man is more extensively
acquainted with the interests and resources of East insular
India, that the indifference of the British government
must have originated solely in the want of information or incorrectness
of knowledge; since it is not improbable, that the
riches of Sumatra and Borneo are equal to those either of
Brazil or New Spain; and it is only from the disadvantages
under which we had hitherto entered into the competition,
that these great sources of wealth had so long been engrossed
by other nations<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>The doctrine, that a colony should always be considered a
distant province of the mother-country, has been foreign to
the political creed of the Dutch; and at any rate the radical
want of strength in the government of Batavia may have prevented
them from venturing to act upon it. Of course, they
must always have contemplated the prosperity of the eastern
tribes with the invidious regret of a rival shopkeeper, and regarded
their progress in civilization with the jealousy of a
timid despot. The fact sufficiently establishes the truth of
this remark.</p>

<p>Independently of the effects of the European influence just
described, the causes which have tended most to the depression
of the Malayan tribes, and the deterioration of their character,
are the civil commotions to which every state is liable,
from the radical want of strength in the sovereign; the constant
wars between the petty chieftains and heads of villages;
the ill-defined succession to the throne, from the doctrine of
primogeniture being imperfectly recognized; the prevalence
of piracy in all the Eastern Seas; the system of domestic slavery,
and all its concomitant evils, as wars for the purpose of
procuring slaves, and the want of confidence between family
and family, man and man; the want of a generally-established,
and recognized system of laws, civil and criminal; the want
of a similar system of commercial regulations respecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Vol I Pg 259]</a></span>
port duties, anchorage, and other charges, to prevent arbitrary
exactions and impositions in the various Malayan ports;
and, finally, the monopoly of the trade assumed by the Malayan
rajas. Had Java remained permanently annexed to
the British crown, the redress of these evils would have been,
in a great measure, in the power of the English nation: the
undertaking would have been worthy of their general character,
and there was no other nation that could have possessed
the means in an equal degree, even if it had indeed possessed
the inclination.</p>

<p>The prevalence of piracy on the Malayan coasts, and the
light in which it was viewed as an honourable occupation,
worthy of being followed by young princes and nobles, is an
evil of ancient date, and intimately connected with the Malayan
habits. The old Malayan romances, and the fragments
of their traditional history, constantly refer with pride to piratical
cruizes.</p>

<p>In addition to other causes, which I shall not stop to specify,
the state of the eastern population, and the intolerant spirit of
the religion of <em>Islam</em>, have eminently tended to increase the
practice. The Arab Sheikhs and Sayeds, whatever doctrines
they failed to inculcate, never neglected to enforce
the merit  of plundering and massacring the infidels; an abominable
tenet, which has tended more than any other doctrine
of the <em>Kóran</em> to the propagation of this religion. Numerous
and various are the tribes of the Eastern Isles which have not
embraced the religion of <em>Islam</em> to this day, and consequently
are reckoned infidels: cruizes against such were, and are,
constantly certain of receiving the approbation of all the Arab
teachers settled in the Malayan countries. The practice of
piracy is now an evil so extensive and formidable, that it can
be put down by the strong hand alone; though precautions
against its recurrence might be taken, by rendering, under the
system of acknowledged ports, every chieftain answerable for
his own territory.</p>

<p>Connected with this evil, though of much wider extent, is
the system of slavery in the Malayan countries, which, to apply
the energetic language of Mr. Pitt to this subject, has been
none of the least efficient causes of keeping down these regions
"in a state of bondage, ignorance, and blood." In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Vol I Pg 260]</a></span>
beginning of the year 1805, the Marquis Wellesley abolished
slavery throughout India; and, on the 4th of June,
1811, the Earl of Minto, by an order to emancipate all the
government slaves at Malacca, and to direct that hereafter no
slaves should be purchased or received on account of government,
gave to the Malayan nations an earnest of his sentiments
on the subject. It is certainly to the credit of our
countrymen in the East, that they have ever opposed all attempts
to introduce the abominable slave traffic into our settlements
there. It was prohibited at Madras by an act of the
Governor and Council, of so early a date as 1682.</p>

<p>The sources of slavery in the Malayan countries are chiefly
piracy at sea, captivity in war, manstealing along the coast,
and the penalties enacted in the Malayan law respecting debts
and sundry misdemeanors. The surviving crews of vessels
which fall into the hands of the pirates are generally disposed
of by sale at the first market. The captives taken in the constant
wars which the Malayan chieftains carry on against each
other, are generally employed in domestic occupations, tending
cattle, and cultivating the ground, where there is no opportunity
of bringing them to market. This, however, is seldom the
case, since such numbers are constantly required by the Arabs
and Chinese traders, and heretofore by the Dutch. Many of
the Arab trading vessels are almost exclusively navigated by
the slaves of the owner; and in their progress from island to
island, they find little difficulty in recruiting their crew, by
receiving presents of slaves, or if that should fail, by kidnapping
the unfortunate natives. This forms a strong argument against
admitting the unrestricted range of the islands to either Chinese
or Arab traders; for while this is permitted, the abolition of
the system of kidnapping would be absolutely impossible.
The pagan tribes in the vicinity of the Mahometans, such as
those on <em>Báli</em>, and some of the tribes of Celebes, the <em>Harafúras</em>,
the black <em>Papúas</em> or oriental negroes, the original inhabitants
of <em>Hálamahíra</em>, <em>Coram</em>, and other easterly nations, are in a
great measure the victims of the kidnapping system, and being
infidels are considered as fair booty.</p>

<p>Nothing has tended more decidedly to the deterioration of
the Malayan character, than the want of a well defined and
generally acknowledged system of law and commercial regu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Vol I Pg 261]</a></span>lation.
The Malayan nations had, in general, made considerable
progress in civilization, before the introduction of the
Mahometan religion among them: they had, accordingly,
regular institutions of their own, some of which were probably
of considerable antiquity, derived from the continent of
India, and consequently radically different from those of the
Arabs.</p>

<p>Some difficulty appears to have occurred in adapting these
institutions to the general tenor of the Mahometan law, and
many anomalous ones appear accordingly to have sprung up
in different states. These occur in every part of jurisprudence,
whether commercial, civil, or criminal, and are recited in the
<em>Undang úndang</em> and <em>Adat Maláyu</em>, which are the systems of
national law among the <em>Maláyus</em>. They vary considerably
from each other in different states, and still more from the
generally acknowledged principle of Mahometan law, as
received by the Arabs. Hence there is, in almost every state,
a constant struggle between the adherents of the old Malayan
usages and the <em>Hájis</em>, together with other religious persons,
who are desirous of introducing the laws of the Arabs, in
order to increase their own importance.</p>

<p>Among the numerous and important evils which result from
this complex and ill-defined system, may be reckoned its
affording an opening for the caprice and tyranny of the
rulers, and producing a general insecurity both of person and
property.</p>

<p>The state of the Moslem religion is very different here from
what it is in the old Mahomedan states, such as Persia, Turkey,
or Arabia. In many of the Eastern Islands paganism still
remains: in some districts there are many Christians, and the
Chinese swarm in every Malayan country, and live intermingled
with the Mahomedans. This mixture of religion and
tribes has tended, in some degree, to soften the intolerance of
the Mahomedan system among the Malayan nations, and
neither the positive authority of <em>Islam</em>, nor the persuasions
of their Arab teachers, have hitherto been able to induce
them to abandon entirely their own peculiar usages and customs.
With some of these usages, especially those which
relate to wrecks on the Malayan shores, and the commercial
regulations of the different ports, it becomes incumbent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Vol I Pg 262]</a></span>
the supreme European authority to interfere. In revising
these, the opportunity might perhaps be taken to procure the
abandonment of some of those maxims and usages, which
have the strongest tendency to prevent their improvement, and
counteract the habits of civilized life.</p>

<p>A circumstance highly injurious to the commerce of the
Malayan nations is the trading monopoly, which in most of
the Malayan ports is actually assumed by the chiefs. Of this
monopoly there is no trace in the <em>Undang úndang</em> of the
<em>Maláyus</em>, or in the fragments of their history which have yet
come to light, and it is a question whether this pernicious
practice has not been copied from the monopoly regulations
of the Dutch. Where this system has been fully carried into
effect, it has generally succeeded effectually in repressing
industry and commercial enterprize; and where it has been
for some time established, its evils have been felt so deeply,
that it may be presumed the Malayan chiefs might be induced
to relinquish it in favour of a regulated commerce, whenever
they might regain the power of collecting regular duties in
lieu of it. The Malayan laws and customs are fortunately of
a very different kind from those adopted among the great
nations of the continent in their vicinity. These nations,
especially the Siamese and Cochin Chinese, have long been
accustomed to look up to the Chinese, with whom they coincide
in religion and manners, and from whom they have
adopted their exclusive maxims of foreign intercourse. The
<em>Málayus</em>, on the other hand, though accustomed to look up
to the Arabs as their religious instructors, seldom hesitate to
admit the superiority of both the Europeans and Chinese,
both to themselves and to the Arabs, in the arts of life and
general science; and it is certainly our interest to encourage
them in this mode of thinking, and to prevent the increase of
the Arab influence among them.</p>

<p>The Dutch nation appears to have pursued, as a principle
of policy, the propagation of Christianity among the Eastern
Islands. The same object had been previously followed by
the Portuguese with great success, and there are now several
small islands in the Malayan Archipelago, inhabited almost
exclusively by Christians of the Catholic persuasion. In
many other islands the Protestant persuasion has made con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Vol I Pg 263]</a></span>siderable
progress, and teachers, in the flourishing times of
the Batavian Regency, were dispersed over all the low chain
of islands which extend from <em>Báli</em> and Lumbok (<em>Sásak</em>) to
the great island Timor. The islands in which the Christian
faith has been most extensively diffused are the great island
<em>Endé</em> or <em>Meng' arái</em>, the great island of <em>Tímor</em>, and the several
small islands in the vicinity, and Amboina. In many of these
islands the natives having no written character of their own,
have been instructed in the Roman character, and taught to
read Malayan and other dialects in it There have also been
various formularies printed for their use, and translations have
been executed for them in some of their languages, which
have little or no affinity to the Malayan. The propagation of
Christianity among these islands is obviously liable to none
of those objections which have been urged against its missionaries
on continental possessions. A great proportion of
the natives are still pagans, under the influence of a wild and
almost unintelligible superstition, the principles of which are
not recorded in books, but are handed down, like stories of
ghosts, fairies, and witches, with all the uncertainty of tradition.
In most instances, the people, though they stand in
great awe of the priests or enchanters, or dealers with invisible
spirits, are very little attached to the superstition in which
they are educated. Many of them are said to be very desirous
of procuring instruction, and in some places they look
up with a degree of veneration to the Mahomedans, as a
people who have received something which they still want.</p>

<p>These observations on the Malayan Islands in general,
apply to no part of the Archipelago more than to the important
and great island of Borneo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Borneo</span> is not only one of the most fertile countries in the
world, but one of the most productive in gold and diamonds<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Vol I Pg 264]</a></span>Its camphor is the finest known, and it is thought capable of
producing every kind of spice. Its eastern coasts, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Vol I Pg 265]</a></span>abound in sago, also furnish a greater quantity of birds'-nests,
sea-slug, and other commodities in great demand in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Vol I Pg 266]</a></span>Chinese market, than the other islands of the East; but the
interior has never been explored by Europeans. It may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Vol I Pg 267]</a></span>conjectured, that the ignorance of the state of the country is
one of the principal causes that no European settlement on it
has hitherto proved advantageous, but has generally been
abandoned after a short trial. The only exception to this
observation is the Dutch settlement of <em>Bánjer-másin</em>, which
continued from 1747 to 1810, when it was formally abandoned
by Marshal Daendals to the Sultan, by agreement, for
the sum of fifty thousand Spanish dollars. The Sultan soon
after sent an embassy, inviting the English to settle; and
previous to the conquest of Java, the Earl of Minto received
the ambassadors at Malacca, and accepted their invitation.</p>

<p>The only territory to which the Dutch had any claim on
the island of Borneo, was the coast from <em>Súkadána</em> to <em>Mempáwa</em>;
this territory they acquired by virtue of a cession from
the Sultan of Bantam in 1778. They destroyed <em>Súkadána</em>,
and established factories at <em>Pontiána</em> and <em>Mempáwa</em>, which
however they abandoned as unproductive after a period of
fourteen years.</p>

<p>In no other part of the island of Borneo has there been
any European settlement. The English, in 1772, intended to
have established a factory at <em>Pásir</em>, but they abandoned the
design on some commotions taking place in that state. Its
object was to make <em>Pásir</em> a depót for opium and India piece
goods, and for the contraband trade in spices. In 1774, a
short time after the first settling of <em>Balambángan</em>, Mr. Jesse
was deputed as Resident to Borneo <em>proper</em>, and concluded a
treaty with that state, by which he acquired for the settlement
of <em>Balambángan</em> the exclusive trade in pepper, stipulating in
return to protect Borneo from the piratical incursions of the
<em>Súlu</em> and <em>Mendanáwi</em> men. Neither of the parties, however,
fulfilled its agreement, though the Residency at Borneo was
continued for some years after the first breaking up of the
settlement of <em>Balambángan</em> in 1775.</p>

<p>On the north-east of Borneo <em>proper</em> lies a very considerable
territory, the sovereignty of which has been long claimed by
the <em>Súlu</em> government; a very considerable part of this, together
with the islands off the coast, have been for upwards of forty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Vol I Pg 268]</a></span>years regularly ceded to the English by the <em>Súlus</em>, and has
also at different periods been assumed by them, without any
objection on the part of the government of Borneo <em>proper</em>.
This ceded district, extending from the river <em>Ki-manis</em> on the
north-west, which forms the boundary of Borneo <em>proper</em>, to
the great bay on the north-east, is undoubtedly a rich and
fertile country, though in a rude and uncultivated state, and it
is admirably situated for commerce, notwithstanding the different
failures of <em>Balambángan</em> may seem to indicate the contrary.
<em>Balambángan</em> is one of the small islands off the
northern extremity of the island of Borneo, and included in
the <em>Súlu</em> grant to the English. It would be foreign to the
present object to enter into any details concerning the history
of the settlement of <em>Balambángan</em>, but it may be proper to
mention, that all the gentlemen who were engaged in the last
attempt were convinced that the bottom of the great <em>Malúdu
Bay</em> would have been infinitely preferable as a settlement on
every account. <em>Balambángan</em> is exactly analogous, in every
respect, to Pinang; it does not admit of territorial extension,
and must exist, if at all, by commerce solely. <em>Malúdu</em>, on the
other hand, is a dependency on the island of Borneo, which
admits of any degree of territorial extension, may always subsist
any number of inhabitants by its own produce, and is said
to communicate, by a land carriage of little more than forty
miles, with the central lakes in the vicinity of the gold countries.</p>

<p>From every inquiry, however, and the result of some experience,
and much reflection, it may be stated, that no settlement
which is founded on a commercial, instead of a territorial
basis, is likely to succeed in that quarter. We have already
acquired territorial rights, and therefore the only question
seems to be, whether these cannot be turned to advantage, as
well by cultivation as by commerce. The <em>Dáyaks</em>, or original
inhabitants of Borneo, are said to be not only industrious, but
particularly disposed to agriculture, and so manageable, that
a handful of <em>Maláyus</em> have, in numerous places, reduced many
thousands of them to the condition of peaceful cultivators of
the ground. Indeed nothing seems wanting but a government
strong enough to afford efficient protection to person and
property. In the case of the <em>Dáyaks</em>, it must be considered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Vol I Pg 269]</a></span>
an advantage, that they have not hitherto adopted the religion
of Islam, and would consequently be more ready from the
first to regard us as their friends. It ought to be calculated
among the inducements to form a settlement on Borneo, that
in that quarter our territorial arrangement would interfere
with the claims or the rights of no European nation. To recommend,
however, the immediate establishment of a settlement
at this particular spot, and on a basis so new, would obviously
be premature, as notwithstanding the length of time we occupied
<em>Balambángan</em>, not only the interior of Borneo was
almost unknown, but until lately, even a great part of its
coasts. This supineness in the government of <em>Balambángan</em>
is perhaps not unexampled. The want of local information
has, indeed, often proved fatal to the infant settlements of the
English. "Colonies and settlements of every kind," says the
author of the Letter on the Nagrais Expedition, "must at
first be attended with many difficulties, which however a
judicious perseverance will surmount, if there be not some
original fault in the establishment. It must be obvious to
every one, that the English never made a settlement, in
which they were not impeded by some unforeseen difficulties,
so as at least frequently to make abandoning the infant
establishment appear the most prudent step, without even
hoping any return for the prodigious expense which may have
been incurred by the undertaking."​&mdash;"Various reasons," adds
that author, "may be ascribed for this event; but incapacity
in the person entrusted with the management, and the
want of previous examination of the place, seem to me the
most common and the most considerable." Without stopping
to inquire how far the want of success in our several attempts
to settle <em>Balambángan</em> may have been fairly attributable
to either of these causes, it may be confidently asserted, that
the last establishment failed chiefly from its being solely of a
military nature, without either professional merchants or mercantile
adventurers being attached to it.</p>

<p>These observations respecting <em>Balambángan</em> apply to it
chiefly as a territorial establishment; but there is no doubt
that it would speedily attain commercial importance. Many
of the commercial advantages which recommended its selection
still exist, to an equal or greater extent; especially those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Vol I Pg 270]</a></span>
which related to Cochin China, Champa, and Cambodia. But
this digression has already exceeded its reasonable limits, and
it is necessary to revert to the more immediate point under
consideration, the commerce of Java. Any account of this
commerce would be imperfect, which after stating the extent
to which it is carried, and the mode in which it is conducted
with the adjacent islands in the same Archipelago, should
omit to mention the advantages of an intercourse with Japan,
and some notices on the Japan trade.</p>

<p>The history of the Dutch connexion with that country is
well known, and can never be forgotten. Perhaps there is not
such an instance in the annals of commerce, of the disgraceful
arts to which mercantile cupidity will resort, and the degradation
to which it will submit for the attainment of its
object, as in the Dutch proceedings at Japan; nor is there,
perhaps, a more remarkable example of the triumphant success,
and complete disappointment of commercial enterprize.
As it may be interesting to many readers to see an authentic
history of the origin, fluctuations, and decline of the Dutch
Japan trade, and as even a very succinct statement of it would
swell this chapter to a disproportioned size, I have placed a
short history of it in the Appendix to this work, to which I
beg leave to refer those who have any curiosity for such details<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.
From the year 1611, when the Dutch established
commercial relations with Japan, till 1671 (a period of sixty
years), their speculations were unrestricted and their profits
were enormous. This was the golden age of their trade: they
opened a mine of wealth, and they fondly thought it inexhaustible,
as well as rich and easily wrought. In 1640, the
Company obtained a return in gold, that yielded a profit of
upwards of a million of guilders. They had been accustomed
to procure, for some time previous to 1663, a return of silver
to the extent of two hundred chests of one hundred pounds
each, and it was suggested that it would be desirable for as
many chests of gold of the same weight to be sent in future.
The golden and silver ages of Japan commerce being past,
the latter half of the seventeenth century began with what the
Dutch called its brazen age, that is its export of copper, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Vol I Pg 271]</a></span>has ever since continued the staple of the Japan market. The
trade was on the decline during the whole of the last century,
and had become of so little importance about 1740, that
the Company deliberated upon the expediency of its total
abandonment. From employing, as at one time, eight or nine
ships, and exporting copper alone to the amount of more than
thirty thousand <em>píkuls</em>, of one hundred and twenty-five pounds
each, it diminished to the use of two vessels, and the purchase
of cargoes of five or six thousand <em>píkuls</em>. The Appendix contains
an account of the nature of the trade, and the result of the
Dutch adventures of 1804-5 and 1806, and of our own in 1813.</p>

foreign speculations, the natives of Java form the crews of all coasting
vessels belonging to Chinese, Arabs, or Europeans, and it is of them almost
exclusively that the class of common sailors, known in the east under the
general denomination of Malays, is composed. Here it may not be improper
to notice the manner in which European vessels have hitherto been
supplied with such crews, and to point out the probable causes of that
atrocious conduct with which the Malayan sailor is so generally reproached.
</p>
<p>
A reference to the maritime customs of the <em>Maláyus</em> will shew the manner
in which the outfit of a native vessel in the Eastern Seas is effected<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.
Each individual on board has a share and interest in the concern, and
among themselves the maritime population is distinguished for good faith
and attachment. In the vessels either commanded or owned by Chinese or
Arabs, the same principle is attended to; and although the common sailors
in these generally receive wages, the petty officers, who are also generally
Javans, have some trifling interest in the cargo, the common men are protected
by them, and the policy of the commanders induces every possible
attention to the usages, prejudices, and comforts of the crews. They are
able to assimilate more nearly with them, and to enter more immediately
into their feeling and their wants, than it is possible for Europeans to do,
and as they do not possess the authority to obtain crews by force, it is only
by a character for good treatment that they can insure an adequate supply
of hands. These vessels navigate throughout the whole extent of the
Archipelago, to Malacca and Acheen on one side, and to the Moluccas
and New Guinea on the other. They are manned exclusively by Javans,
usually called Malays, and no instances occur of the crews rising either
upon the Arab or Chinese commander: they are, on the contrary, found
to be faithful, hardworking, and extremely docile. How is it when
Malays are employed in vessels belonging to Europeans? The Javans are
originally not a seafaring people; they have an aversion for distant voyages,
and require the strongest inducements to quit the land, even for a coasting
expedition in the smooth seas of their own Archipelago, beyond which, if
they ever engage themselves on board a colonial vessel, they make an express
agreement, not to be carried: European vessels in want of hands for
more distant voyages to Europe, India, and China, have been compelled
therefore to resort to force or fraud, as the means of obtaining crews.
The Dutch government were in the habit of employing people, known among
the Javans by the term <em>sélong</em>, as kidnappers, who prowled about at night,
pounced upon the unwary peasant who might be passing along, and hurried
him on ship-board. When the direct influence of government was not used,
the native regents or chiefs were employed to obtain people for the crews of
vessels: this they did sometimes in the same manner, though more frequently
condemning to sea as many as were required, by an indiscriminate draft on
the neighbouring population. The native chiefs were perhaps paid a certain
head-money, on what may have been considered by the European
commanders as nothing more than <em>crimpage</em>. The people who were seized
were seldom of a seafaring class, but almost entirely landsmen, in many
instances perhaps opium smokers, or persons obtained from the lowest and
most worthless part of the community. Once embarked, their fate was
sealed for ever, and due care was taken that they never landed again on
Java, as long as their services as sailors were required.
</p>
<p>
In this manner are obtained that extensive class of sailors, denominated
Malays, who are found on board almost every country ship in India, and
inhabit the sea-ports in considerable numbers, particularly Calcutta, where
they have a distinct quarter allotted them. They are taken from their home
against their will, and in violation of all their views and habits. In general,
neither their language or customs are in the least understood by their new
master, for though most of the commanders in the eastern trade may speak
the Malayan language, and be accustomed to the Malayan character, they
know nothing of the Javan language, and but little of the manners, habits,
and prejudices of the Javan people.
</p>
<p>
That numerous instances have occurred, in which they have appeared
the foremost in mutiny and in the massacre of their officers, will not be
denied; but it is well known, that many instances of ships being cut off
by the Malay crews, have been occasioned by the tyrannical and inhuman
character of the commanders; and however dreadful the massacre, some
excuse may be made on the score of provocation, for a people low in the
scale of moral restraint and intellectual improvement. In some cases they
have been made the instruments and dupes of the villany of others, and
have merely followed in the track of cruelty. In general, so little care
seems to be devoted to the comforts of these people, and so much violence
offered to their habits, that a person accustomed to observe the course of
human action, and to calculate the force of excited passions, is almost
surprized to find the instances of mutiny and retaliation are so few.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_61_61" id="Footnote_61_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> Mr. Hogendorp makes the following observations on the cotton of
Java. "This article of produce, which now, in order to provide the Company
with a few hundred <em>píkuls</em> of cotton-yarn at a low rate, is only
productive of vexation and oppression to the poor natives, might be
made of the greatest value, both to Java itself and to the mother country.
The plant grows in abundance and of good quality, especially if
the best kinds of seeds are procured from the Coromandel Coast and
the Isle of France. The cultivation of cotton is not at all injurious to
any other branch, for after the rice harvest is the best season for planting
the cotton, and before the rains, when the fields are again ploughed for
rice, the cotton is ripe and gathered.
</p>
<p>
"Little of it is comparatively planted at present; indeed only the necessary
quantity, after providing the natives with coarse cloths, for the
government contingent. In rough cotton there is no trade at all: but,
in fact, what trade is there on Java, except the monopoly trade of the
Chinese?
</p>
<p>
"Let us but suppose the cultivator to have a property in the soil, and
that he, as well as the trader, were at liberty to buy and sell, how soon
should we see the Javan planting cotton directly after his rice was
reaped. After being cleaned by machinery and screwed into bales, it
might be exported to China and Europe.
</p>
<p>
"There is no doubt that the Javan cotton would be as good at least, if
not better, than the cotton of the English, whether from Bombay, Madras,
and Bengal, and it might certainly be produced cheaper; but even
suppose that, when cleaned and picked, it cost ten rix-dollars a <em>píkul</em>,
the Javans would still be well paid."</p></div>

that during the first fourteen of these years, the quantity made and delivered
over to the Company for export to Holland, Persia, &amp;c. amounted
to 642,234 <em>píkuls</em>, or to an average of 47,874 annually, two of these years
being almost entirely unproductive, on account of the non-payment to
the manufacturers of money, to enable them to carry on their business.
During the latter half of the period, or from 1794 to 1808, the quantity
manufactured and delivered over to the Company amounted to 917,598
<em>píkuls</em>, averaging 65,542 annually. All the sugar for export, during this
period, as stated in the text, was delivered over at fixed rates to the
government, and was placed under laws of the strictest monopoly. To
shew the great practicability of an increase to almost any extent, we may
adduce the sudden start in the supply occasioned by the American demand
in 1800. In no preceding year had this article of produce been
delivered over to the Company to a greater amount than 67,552 <em>píkuls</em>,
and in that year the quantity sold at Batavia to Americans alone,
amounted to 91,554, and for the subsequent years averaged 100,000
<em>píkuls</em>, and sold for 900,000 Java rupees, or 11,000<em>l.</em> sterling. The principal
part of this was manufactured at Batavia, the quantity supplied by
<em>Jawâna</em>, <em>Japâra</em>, <em>Chéribon</em>, <em>Surabáya</em>, and <em>Semárang</em>, being but proportionally
small till 1803, when <em>Japára</em> contributed to the exports of the
island in this article 12,219. In 1804, the same province supplied 21,175
píkuls. The disadvantage under which the manufacturer laboured, by
forced deliveries at inadequate rates, need not be here insisted on, though
it must be taken into the account in any estimate of the attainable increase
of the manufacture.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Mr. Hogendorp makes the following observations on the coffee and
pepper of Java:​&mdash;"In comparing the produce of the West Indian islands,
according to their proportionate extent, population, and expenses of
cultivation, I have frequently left off in the middle of my calculations;
but I am sure that Java, on a very moderate calculation, can without
difficulty yield fifty millions of pounds of coffee annually.
</p>
<p>
"For a long period, the planting of coffee was confined to the Batavian
high and <em>Priáng'en</em> lands, and to <em>Chéribon</em>, on the principles of that
short-sighted and self-destroying policy and spirit of monopoly, by
which the company and the government of Batavia have ever been
characterized. It is only of late years that it has been permitted to
extend and revive the cultivation in the eastern districts. But the Commissioners,
in May 1796, ordered that the cultivation should be abolished;
and in the month of September in the same year, this order was
countermanded, and the planting of coffee ordered to be promoted in
the most rigorous manner possible. But what is to be expected from a
country, where the natives are so treated, so oppressed? To-day the
Javan is ordered to plant his garden with coffee trees: he does so, and
although well aware how little he will get for the fruit, he sees them
grow up with pleasure, considering their produce as a tribute which he
must pay to his master for enjoyment of protection; but now, when
they are about to bear fruit, he is ordered to root them out: he does
so, and four months afterwards he is again ordered to plant others!
Can a more infamous tyranny be imagined? Can it be credited, that any
government should act so madly, so inconsistently? And yet this is the
plain and real truth. But how can stupid ignorance, which by the
vilest means, by base meanness, mercenary marriages, and every kind
of low trick, rises into power and importance, and then becomes by
wealth luxurious, and by flattery intoxicated, act otherwise? And will
you, Batavians, continue to trust in such hands as these, your valuable
possessions and interests in India?
</p>
<p>
"Pepper grows but slowly on any soil, and is so nice with regard to it,
that in some places, where to all appearance there would be an abundant
produce of the plant, it will not grow at all. The vine requires
four or five years to produce fruit. The improvident Javan, who under
the present despotic administration, can and will scarcely provide for
his daily subsistence, finds this too long a delay between his labour and
its reward: having, therefore, no sufficient motive to pursue the cultivation
cheerfully or actively, he can only be driven to it by force; but
let him once experience the advantage of property in land; let him see
the trader ready with plenty of money to purchase the fruits of his
labour; let him, if he should still be idle, observe his more industrious
neighbour acquire wealth, by the sale of those articles which he slothfully
declines to cultivate, and with it procure the necessaries or conveniences
of life, and he will soon be induced, by emulation and the desire
of ameliorating his condition, to plough and plant his ground. The
Island of Java will then produce a considerable quantity of pepper, for
which, if the cultivator obtains twelve rix-dollars per <em>píkul</em>, he will be
amply paid.
</p>
<p>
"Although every thing goes on with difficulty at first, and it cannot be
denied that it will require time and trouble to stimulate the Javans,
who are now confounded, as it were, with tyranny and oppression, to
industry and emulation, it is notwithstanding equally certain, that an
improved system of administration, founded on property of the soil,
freedom of person and trade, would by degrees, though perhaps much
quicker than may be imagined, bring about such a change, and that
Java might and would produce as much pepper for exportation annually
as coffee, or about two hundred thousand <em>píkuls</em>, which will bring three
thousand six hundred rix-dollars into the country."
</p>
<p>
In the year 1801, it was estimated by one of the first commercial houses
in Europe, that the following quantities of pepper might be obtained from
different ports of the Archipelago.

"<span class="smcap">Ports</span> <em>and</em> <span class="smcap">Places</span> <em>where</em> <span class="smcap">Pepper</span> <em>is to be had</em>:​&mdash;<em>estimated in March 1801</em>.

<p>
"At <em>Bencoolen</em>, belonging to the English, may be had about twelve
hundred tons of pepper per annum.
</p>
<p>
"At <em>Prince of Wales Island</em>, belonging to the English, may be had at
present only one hundred tons per annum: in a few years it will be five

Acheen, may be had one thousand tons per annum.

about one thousand tons per annum: the Danes often go to these two
ports.

"At <em>Tringano</em> and <em>Kalanton</em>, belonging to a Malayan prince, may be
had about two thousand tons per annum: the Europe Portuguese ships
often call at these ports on their way to China.

to send all his pepper to Batavia; it may be about seven hundred tons
per annum.

"At <em>Bánjer-másin</em>, on the south-west of Borneo: the Dutch have a

twelve to fifteen hundred tons per annum.

annually (four thousand tons). There is also a ready market at the
Cape of Good Hope, for one thousand kóyans a year. A scarcity of this
grain frequently happens on the coast of Coromandel, when the import
of it from Java will yield great profit, if the traders are permitted to
export it. The general freedom of commerce and navigation, and the
encouragement such freedom holds out to the merchant, will establish
and extend a ready communication and friendly relation between Batavia
and the trading places of India. In the article of rice, Java possesses
advantages superior to Bengal; for although this grain is generally very
cheap there, yet the navigation from and to Bengal is always more
difficult than that from and to Java, from whence, at all seasons of the
year, the passage may be made to most parts of India: and in Bengal
it often happens, that the rice is very scarce and dear, and even that a
famine rages there. On the island of Java, on the contrary, although
the crops may sometimes partially fail in a few places, a general and
total failure never happens: at least there is no instance of it on record.
It may also be considered, whether the exportation of rice from Java
to Europe might not become an object of speculation. The cargo of
a ship of five hundred lasts, or kóyans, would only cost fifteen thousand
rix-dollars, which cannot be reckoned at more than thirty thousand
guilders; and the kóyan being calculated at three thousand five hundred
pounds, the only question would be, what would be the value of
one million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds of rice in Europe,
and if the undertaking would afford a reasonable gain? Even China is
sometimes much in want of rice, and the export of it to that country
would often, if not always, turn out very advantageous."​&mdash;<em>Hogendorp.</em>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> "We, the Batavians," says Mr. Hogendorp, "or rather our good
and heroic ancestors, conquered these countries by force of arms. The
Javans, who are immediately under our jurisdiction, acknowledge the
Batavian nation or the East India Company as their lord or sovereign;
but by so doing, although they resigned their political rights, they still
retained their civil and personal liberty, at least their right thereto.
But what relation do the Chinese bear to us, and what are the rights
they can require from us? As foreigners and itinerant traders, this
may be easily defined, but as inhabitants and settlers a further inquiry
becomes necessary. To political rights, or to a share in the government
and revenues of the country, they have not the slightest claim, and as
inhabitants, they cannot even claim the enjoyment of the same civil or
personal privileges as the Javans: in the first place, because they are
not natives of the country; secondly, because they take no interest in
the welfare or preservation of the country; thirdly, because they only
endeavour to derive their gain at the expense of the Europeans as well
as the Javans, in order to return to China with the profits they make,
or at least to send as much of it as possible to their families there;
fourthly, because they have no regard whatever to the welfare of our
country, and would be quite indifferent to the English, or any other
nation, driving us from Java. For these reasons, I conceive that the
Chinese have not the same right as the Javans to the freedom or privilege
of citizens. The basis of all civil communities is incontrovertibly
the sacrifice of a part of the liberty, rights, and even property of each
individual, for the enjoyment and security of the remainder; and this
remainder, when fixed, forms the civil freedom and privileges of such a
community. Not only are the Chinese quite exempt from this sacrifice,
but they are also, by the corruption of the Batavian government, much
less burdened than all the other inhabitants, even the Europeans, and
are besides favoured with considerable privileges and exclusive means of
gaining wealth. These are facts, which no one who is acquainted with
Batavia can or will contradict.
</p>
<p>
"Were impartial justice to be adhered to, the Chinese would be looked
upon and treated only as foreigners, who are suffered and admitted, as
long as it is not injurious to our interest and safety, to settle in our
country and under our protection, seeking in trade or agriculture their
means of subsistence and emolument, and to whom, on account of their
numbers, it is allowed by our indulgence, as long as they conduct
themselves well and peaceably, to preserve and practise their own
manners and customs, and even in particular places, to dwell together
under their own chiefs.
</p>
<p>
"All the Chinese who come to Java every year in such vast numbers,
in the junks from China, or in other vessels from neighbouring places,
are the refuse of their nation, and principally from a province, the natives
of which are considered by their own countrymen the worst of the
whole empire. These people come half naked and poor in the extreme:
they add, therefore, so many more to the population, which must be
supported by the country, to which however they contribute nothing.
It must be acknowledged, they are, particularly at first, very active, industrious,
inventive, and frugal. At Batavia they exercise almost every
useful art, trade, and handicraft, they cultivate and produce the best vegetables,
they work the sugar-mills, and appear therefore to be uncommonly
useful and perhaps indispensable.
</p>
<p>
"The trade in the interior, wholesale and retail: the trade to sea, to the
opposite shores, and elsewhere in the Straits, is entirely in their hands,
and is almost wholly carried on by them. In all considerable places on
the coast, as well as in the interior of Java, they have distinct towns,
called kampongs, where they live under their own chiefs, and follow
their own customs and manners. Finally, they have exclusively all the
farms of the government taxes and revenues, both in the Company's
districts and in the dominions of the native princes: by which means
they are complete masters of all trade, internal and foreign; and are enabled
to make monopolies in every thing, which they do accordingly in
the most extensive manner. The burthens they have to bear are, on the
contrary, very trifling; in fact, almost nothing: especially because they
are exempt from all feudal and personal services, which are so oppressive
to the Javans.
</p>
<p>
"To what can this impropriety and injustice be ascribed but to the government
of Batavia? The Chinese have obtained all these favours and
privileges by making considerable presents, and thus sacrificing the interests
of the Company and the nation to their selfishness and avarice.
These arbitrary governors of the East Indies have made the Chinese
possessors of Java: for I undertake to prove, that the wealth of the
Chinese on that island amounts to ten times as much as the property
of all the Europeans added together, and that their profits every year
bear the same proportion.
</p>
<p>
"With reference to their numbers and character, I am of opinion that the
following resolutions regarding them might be adopted: That the Chinese
on Java should be allowed to remain, and even that further arrivals
of them should be permitted; care being taken, however, to keep them
in good order, that they should be prevented from injuring the Javans,
either by force or fraud: that they be not more favoured than others:
that they should contribute a proportionate and equitable share towards
the revenues of the state for their enjoyment of the rights of
citizenship, in the same manner as other inhabitants, which can best be
effected by means of a capitation tax. Uncultivated and uninhabited
lands might then be granted or sold to the Chinese, as well as to the natives,
to establish sugar-mills or plantations. By these means, every
practicable use and advantage would be derived from them, as an industrious
and active people, without doing any injury to the other inhabitants,
and especially the Javans as natives of the country: and because
they have no interest in our national welfare, they should be made, as
an equitable compensation, to pay a higher rate to the state. In other
respects, they may be completely subjected to our laws, and may be
treated with kindness as well as justice.
</p>
<p>
"The number of Chinese on Java is much greater than is generally
imagined, and annually more of them arrive by thousands. By connexions
with the native women, their families increase in inconceivable
numbers. These half-Chinese retain the language, religion, manners,
customs, and even the dress of their fathers; and are generally called
Pernakans, although that name is also frequently applied exclusively to
those Chinese who embrace the Mahometan religion; and these, as a
separate class of people, have their own chiefs, or sometimes confound
themselves with the Javans, and can only be distinguished by their
lighter complexion."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> Among the exports from Java for the Europe market, no particular
notice has been taken in the text of the extent of the spice trade, the produce
of the Moluccas having, during the provisional administration of the
British government, been conveyed direct from Amboina to the port of
London, without being landed and re-assorted at Batavia, as was formerly
the case under the Dutch government.
</p>
<p>
The sovereign Prince of the Netherlands has, by a solemn act, abandoned
his right to the feudal services of his native subjects in the Eastern Archipelago,
but has at the same time reserved to the state the exclusive monopoly
of the spices. It may perhaps have been deemed expedient, in aid of
the finances of Great Britain, that this odious monopoly should have been
permitted to remain for upwards of five years under her uncontrolled dominion;
and that, while the cloves on Amboina were raised by forced services,
the nutmeg gardens on Banda should have been cultivated by slaves.
There may have been reasons also which induced her to continue the system
of extirpation in the neighbouring islands, and to act up to those stipulations
for depressing these unhappy countries, for which the Dutch have in
all ages been so justly reprobated. But now that the sovereign, to whom
they are again ceded, has recommenced the Dutch administration in the
Eastern seas, with an appearance of something more like justice, humanity,
and sound policy than we have been in the habit of witnessing for the last
two centuries, it is to be hoped that the profits of two annual cargoes of
spices, whatever they may amount to, will never be considered of sufficient
importance to tempt a great and magnanimous nation longer to trample on
the hallowed rights of humanity, and to persevere in a system, which, while
it may have afforded a temporary profit, has tended to degrade, depopulate,
and destroy the fairest countries in creation. If the nutmeg and clove
trees were allowed to grow where Providence would seem to have ordained
that in their natural course they should, and this trade were opened to a
free commerce, nutmegs might perhaps be procured as cheap as betel-nut,
and cloves as cheap as pepper.
</p>
<p>
"In the Spice Islands," observes Adam Smith, "the Dutch are said to
burn all the spiceries which a fertile season produces beyond what they
expect to dispose of in Europe, with such a profit as they think sufficient.
In the islands where they have no settlements they give a premium to
those who collect the blossoms and green leaves of the clove and nutmeg
trees which naturally grow there, but which this savage policy has now,
it is said, completely exterminated. Even in the islands where they
have settlements, they have very much reduced, it is said, the number
of those trees. If the produce even of their own islands was much
greater than what suited their market, the natives, they suspect, might
find means to convey some part of it to other nations; and the best way,
they imagine, to secure their own monopoly, is to take care that no more
shall grow than what they themselves carry to market. By different
acts of oppression, they have reduced the population of the Moluccas
nearly to the number which is sufficient to supply with fresh provisions
and other necessaries of life, their own insignificant garrisons, and such
of their ships as occasionally come there for a cargo of spices. Under
the government of the Portuguese, however, these islands are said to
have been tolerably well peopled."
</p>
<p>
Had Dr. Smith written at the present day he might have heightened the
picture by observing, that so far from even being able to supply the garrisons,
these islands have long been considered incapable of raising sufficient supplies
for their own subsistence; they have for many years depended almost
entirely on Java for rice and the common necessaries of life, and latterly
supplies have been sent to them from Bengal.</p></div>

is comparatively of recent date, and the very general view here
taken has reference to the intercourse which has subsisted during the last
century.</p></div>

of Chinese employed in the gold mines at Mentrada and other places on
the western side of Borneo, amounts to not less than thirty-two thousand
working men. When a mine affords no more than four <em>bengkals</em> (weighing
about two dollars each, or something less than a <em>tahil</em>) per man in the year,
it is reckoned a losing concern, and abandoned accordingly. Valuing the
<em>bengkal</em> at eighteen Spanish dollars, which is a low rate of estimation, and
supposing only four <em>bengkals</em> produced in the year by the labour of each
man, the total produce is 128,000 <em>bengkals</em>, worth 2,224,000 Spanish
dollars, equal to 556,000<em>l.</em>, at the rate of five shillings the dollar. But it
is asserted, that upon the general run of the mines, seldom less than six
<em>bengkals</em> per head has been obtained, and in very rainy seasons seven.
Taking the medium at six and a half <em>bengkals</em>, the 32,000 Chinese will
procure 208,000 <em>bengkals</em>, which at eighteen Spanish dollars the <em>bengkal</em> is
3,744,000 Spanish dollars, equal to 936,000<em>l.</em> Such is the result of a very
moderate calculation of the produce of these mines. According to an estimate
made in the year 1812, the annual produce of the mines on the west
coast of Borneo was estimated at 4,744,000 Spanish dollars, being an  excess
of a million sterling. The quantity of gold procured on Sumatra, the
supposed golden Chersonesus of the ancients, is according to Mr. Marsden
about 30,800 ounces, which, at 4<em>l.</em> sterling the ounce, is worth 123,200<em>l.</em>,
equal to 492,800 Spanish dollars.
</p>
<p>
With respect to the disposal of the gold from the mines of Borneo, it
may be observed, that every native Chinese, whether employed in the
mines, in agriculture, as merchant or artificer, manages every year to remit
at least the value of one <em>tahil</em>, more or less, of gold to his relations in
China. These remittances are generally made by the junks in gold, as it
saves freight, is more easily smuggled on shore without the notice of the
rapacious Mandarin, and remitted over-land to the residence of their families.
Taking the Chinese male population who can thus remit at double
the number employed in the mines, and supposing one half to be born in
the country, most of whom may not remit to China, this remittance would
amount to 34,000 <em>bengkals</em> or <em>tahils</em>, which at eighteen Spanish dollars is
612,000 dollars, or 153,000<em>l.</em>
</p>
<p>
It is calculated that, one year with another, at least five hundred Chinese
return in the junks to their native country with a competency. Several
have been known to take away one thousand <em>bengkals</em> of gold, many from
three to five hundred, but very few return before they have cleared a competency
of two thousand dollars, or from one hundred to one hundred and
twenty <em>tahil</em> of gold. This goes partly in gold; though they prefer investing
a part of it in tin from Banka, opium, and other articles. Say, however,
that they remit one half in gold, five hundred men, at one thousand
dollars each, will give five hundred thousand dollars, which added to the
small family remittances, accounts for an amount exceeding one million of
dollars, or 250,000<em>l.</em> This calculation, however, seems to be far within
the mark, and gives less by one half than what is usually stated to be remitted
to China from the Bornean mines, which has been estimated at a
loose guess at two millions of dollars, or 500,000<em>l.</em>
</p>
<p>
A further amount of not less than the value of a million of dollars
(250,000<em>l.</em>) is supposed to find its way annually to Western India, and
principally to Bengal, <em>viâ</em> Batavia, Malacca, and Pinang, for the purchase
of opium and piece goods. The surplus enriches Java and some of
the other islands, in exchange for salt, tobacco, coarse cloths, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
As the mines are worked with so little expence of machinery, the funds
necessary for commencing an undertaking of the kind are small; and as
the property of the soil belongs to the first occupant, almost every Chinese
would become a proprietor, but from the mode by which their services are,
in the first instance, secured by the council of proprietors or kongsis. A
parcel of half-starved Chinese, enchanted with the prospect of wealth on
the golden shores of Borneo, readily find a passage in the annual junks
that sail from the mother-country to Borneo, at ten dollars a head. On their
arrival, being unable to pay the passage money, and the tax of a dollar per
head, established by the native authority, while their immediate wants of
food, clothing, and habitation, are urgent and imperious, the proprietors of
the mines find it easy to engage their services for three or four years. In
some other cases, agents are employed to obtain men from China, on stipulated
agreements, to work for a number of years; the usual rate of payment
to the miners so engaged is not considered to average less than five Spanish
dollars a month. No sooner, however, are these engagements concluded
with their masters, than a number of them club together with the funds
they have been able to save, and commence a new mine upon their joint
account, in a few years acquiring a competency to return to their native
country.
</p>
<p>
<span class="smcap">Diamonds.</span>​&mdash;There appears to be no just foundation for the idea, that
the diamonds of Borneo are inferior to those of Golconda. Many of an
inferior quality have no doubt found their way into the market, because
there was perhaps less skill and judgment in the selection; but the value of
diamonds here, as well as every where else, depends upon their shape, size,
and water, and in this respect the diamonds of Borneo will bear a comparison
with those of any country yet known. Indeed, as far as we may
judge from the present state of our information, the Lándak mines alone
are as productive, and its diamonds as precious, as any other in the world.
</p>
<p>
The principal mines where diamonds are regularly dug for on Borneo,
and found in any considerable quantities, are those of Lándak, Sángau, on
the great river Lawi, and the districts of Bánjer-másin. Diamonds have
been occasionally found within the limits of Borneo Proper, at Mátan and
Sukadána. The mines of Lándak are as ancient as the Malayan dominion
on the islands, those of Sángau are of more recent date, and those of Bánjer-másin
are said to have been first discovered in the reign of Sultan Sepoh,
from whom the present sultan is the fourth in descent.
</p>
<p>
Diamonds are not only found in the bottom of rivers when dry, but at
the foot of craggy hills and mountains. The <em>párits</em>, or mines, are dug to
the depth of from one to five fathoms only; but experience has invariably
proved, that the deeper they are dug, not only are the diamonds more abundant,
but superior in size, shape, and water. The soil which produces
diamonds is known from a species of earth called by the natives <em>lábor</em> or
<em>lábor-gig'gi</em>. This is sometimes black, sometimes white, red, orange, and
green: it is a species of earth which stains the clothes of the labourer, and
is distinguished by many names.
</p>
<p>
At Lándak there are ten <em>párits</em> worked by Chinese, and in each from
twenty to thirty labourers employed. As a general average, eight Chinese
are supposed to find about eight <em>bengkals</em> of diamonds in a year. From two
to three hundred of the smallest sort are supposed to go to a <em>bengkal</em>, valued
at from twenty to twenty-four rupees. This is independent of the
larger ones, which are casual. So far back as the year 1738, the Dutch
annually exported from the produce of these mines, diamonds to the value
of from two to three hundred thousand dollars.
</p>
<p>
Few courts of Europe could perhaps boast of a more brilliant display of
diamonds than, in the prosperous times of the Dutch, was exhibited by
the ladies of Batavia, the principal and only mart yet opened for the Bornean
diamond mines, and whence those known in the European world have
been procured. With the decline of the Dutch government, however, the
demand has decreased, and the mines are now almost neglected, the numerous
diamond-cutters not being able to obtain a livelihood. Formerly,
when more Chinese were employed in the mines of Lándak, diamonds
from ten to thirteen carats were common in the public markets. The
Pangéran of Lándak now wears one of eighteen, and another of fourteen
carats and a half. Since Java has been in the possession of the English,
rough diamonds from Borneo have been sent to England, and, even in a
very unfavourable state of the market, turned out an advantageous remittance.
</p>
<p>
Among the larger diamonds which these mines have produced, it may
not be uninteresting to mention, that the great diamond now in the possession
of the Sultan of Mátan, which has been seen and examined by
Europeans, weighs three hundred and sixty-seven carats: it is of the shape
of an egg indented on one side. It is, however, uncut; and, on this
account, it may be difficult to say, whether it will become the largest cut
diamond ever known; for the famous diamond of Aurung Zebe, called
the Mogul, in its rough state weighed seven hundred and ninety-five
carats, and was then valued at 600,000<em>l.</em>, but when cut was reduced to
two hundred and seventy-nine carats. This celebrated diamond, known
by the name of the Mátan diamond, was discovered by a dáyak, and
claimed as a droit of royalty by the Sultan of the country, Gúru-Láya;
but was handed over to the Pangéran of Lándak, whose brother having
got possession of it, gave it as a bribe to the Sultan of Súkadána, in order
that he might be placed on the throne of Lándak: the lawful prince, however,
having fled to Bantam, by the aid of the prince of that country and
the Dutch, succeeded in regaining possession of his district, and nearly
destroyed Súkadána. It has remained as an heir-loom in the family of
these princes for four descents, and is almost the only appendage of royalty
now remaining.</p></div>

<p>Having, in the foregoing pages, attempted to introduce the
inhabitants of Java to the reader, by an account of their person,
their manners, and employment in the principal departments
of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, I shall
now endeavour to make him, in some degree, acquainted with
their intellectual and moral character, their institutions, government,
and such other particulars as may contribute to
enable him to form some estimate of their relative rank in the
scale of civilized society.</p>

<p>From what has been stated of their progress in the manufacturing
and agricultural arts, their general advancement in
knowledge may be easily estimated. There are no establishments
for teaching the sciences, and there is little spirit of
scientific research among them. The common people have
little leisure or inclination for improving their minds or acquiring
information, but they are far from being deficient in
natural sagacity or docility. Their organs are acute and delicate,
their observation is ready, and their judgment of character
is generally correct. Like most Eastern nations, they
are enthusiastic admirers of poetry, and possess a delicate ear
for music. Though deficient in energy, and excited to action
with difficulty, the effect probably of an enervating climate
and a still more enervating government, they are capable of
great occasional exertion, and sometimes display a remarkable
perseverance in surmounting obstacles or enduring labours.
Though ignorant and unimproved, they are far from wanting
intelligence in the general objects of their pursuit, and fre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Vol I Pg 273]</a></span>quently
astonish Europeans by the ingenuity of their expedients,
and the facility with which they accomplish difficult
operations by apparently inadequate means.</p>

<p>People in a rude state of society are not always prepared
to admit their inferiority, or inclined to adopt manifest improvements:
what is much beyond their skill or their power,
may excite their wonder, but does not always tempt their
imitation. This is more peculiarly the case, where national
pride or religious prejudice stand in the way; and the contempt
of unbelievers, with which the Mahomedan system inspires
its votaries, leads them usually to undervalue the arts
in which others excel, or the instruction which they communicate.
The Javans, though far from deficient in national
pride, and though Mahomedans, are free from this senseless
and pernicious prejudice, and are ready to acknowledge the
superiority of the Europeans, as well as disposed to imitate
their arts and to obey their direction. No people can be more
tractable; and although their external appearance indicates
listlessness and sometimes stupidity, none possess a quicker
apprehension of what is clearly stated, or attain a more rapid
proficiency in what they have a desire to learn. The restraints
under which conversation labours by the necessity of using
different dialects in addressing different orders of society, as
well as the respect paid to superiority of rank, prevents them
from such a frequent intercourse of thought and opinion as
might otherwise be expected, and often renders them, to appearance,
reserved and taciturn, although in fact, they are
social, cheerful, and good humoured.</p>

<p>An uninstructed people are often credulous, and the Javans
are remarkable for their unsuspecting and almost infantine
credulity. Susceptible of every impression that artifice may
attempt to make upon them, and liable to every delusion propagated
by the prejudiced or the designing, they not inaptly
compare themselves to a piece of pure white cloth, on which
any dye or shade of colour may be laid. They lend an easy
credence to omens, to prognostics, to prophets, and to quacks.
They easily become the dupes of any religious fanatic, and
credit, without scruple or examination, his claim to supernatural
powers. Their profession of Mahomedanism has not
relieved them from the superstitious prejudices and observ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Vol I Pg 274]</a></span>ances
of an anterior worship: they are thus open to the accumulated
delusion of two religious systems.</p>

<p>They are great observers of lucky or unlucky days, or natural
phenomena, and undertake no journey or enterprize
without attending to them. It is unlucky to go any where
on the day that you hear of the death of a friend: the sight
of two crows fighting in the air is unlucky: two small birds
(called <em>prenjak</em>) fighting near a house, afford a prognostic of
the arrival of a friend from a distance. Explosions or noises
heard from the mountains not only excite terror for their immediate
consequences, but are thought to forebode some great
calamity, unconnected with the convulsions of nature, of
which they are the symptoms, such as a sanguinary war, a
general famine, or an epidemic sickness. The eclipses of the
sun and moon powerfully excite this superstitious spirit, and
induce many absurd notions and observations. Earthquakes
furnish certain prognostics, according to the day of the month
on which they happen. In none of their superstitions, however,
is there any thing of that gloomy, dark, or malignant
cast, which distinguishes those of less favoured climates or of
more savage tribes.</p>

<p>Although, on many occasions, listless and unenterprising,
their religious enthusiasm is no sooner excited, than they
become at once adventurous and persevering, esteeming no
labour arduous, no result impossible, and no privation painful.
We witnessed an instance, both of their simplicity and of their
energy, connected with this part of their character, which excited
our astonishment. The population of some of the districts
of <em>Bányumás</em> contributed their voluntary labour, in
1814, to the construction of a broad high road, from the base
to the summit of one of the loftiest mountains on the island
(the mountain <em>Súmbing</em>), and this extraordinary public work
was almost completed, before intelligence of its commencement
reached the government. It was in consequence examined,
and found to be a work of immense labour and care,
but without the least appearance of object or utility. Upon
enquiring into the motive of such a singular undertaking, it
was learnt that a general belief prevailed, that there was a
very holy man at the top of the mountain, who would not
come down till there should be a good road made for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Vol I Pg 275]</a></span>
The <em>Madúrese</em> are said to believe, that the spirits of the dead
revisit the earth; but this does not appear to be a Javan
superstition.</p>

<p>Their prejudices are neither very numerous nor unyielding,
and seem generally to have originated in some laudable feeling
or amiable weakness. Their nationality, which is very
strong, although it delights in the traditionary narratives of
ancient Javan exploits, and supports a hope of future independence,
which they are not backward to express, does not lead
them to despise the character, or to undervalue the acts of
strangers. They have a contempt for trade, and those of
higher rank esteem it disgraceful to be engaged in it; but the
common people are ever ready to engage in the labours of
agriculture, and the chiefs to honour and encourage agricultural
industry. Those of the highest rank and greatest authority,
generally attend at the opening of new <em>sáwah</em> fields,
performing part of the work with their own hands, and leading
their inferiors or dependents, as they express it, to pay
respect to the earth, in whose honour they also observe annually
the <em>sedéka búmi</em>, or feast to the earth. It is in the
same spirit that the buffalo, as the chief assistant of the husbandman,
is viewed with such peculiar regard, that in some
of the interior districts, new-born infants are sometimes carried
to be breathed upon by them, from a superstitious belief
that such a ceremony will render them fortunate.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the despotic nature of their government,
and the feudal principles on which it rests, the Javan must
be considered as a patriarchial people, still retaining many of
the virtues, and all the simplicity, which distinguish that
state of society. Their village settlements constitute detached
societies, under their local chief and priest, and the same internal
concord prevails in these little associations which characterises
patriarchial tribes. Vicinity and daily intercourse
afford opportunities of conferring real assistance and acts of
kindness: injustice and even violence may sometimes be committed
against the inhabitants of other villages, but very seldom
by the inhabitants of the same village against each other.
The patriarchial spirit of the Javans may be further traced, in
the veneration which they pay to age, the respect and acquiescence
with which they receive the maxims or the counsels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Vol I Pg 276]</a></span>
of experience, the ready contented submission which they
shew to the commands of their immediate superiors, the
warmth of their domestic attachments, and the affectionate
reverence with which they regard and protect the tombs and
the ashes of their fathers. To the same description of feelings
may be referred that consideration for ancestry, that
attention to the line of descent, and that regard to the history
and merits of distant kindred, which in the meanest people
appears often to assume the character of family pride.</p>

<p>These observations apply principally to the inhabitants of
villages, at some distance from the seats of the princes or
regents, and the contagion of the larger capitals, and more
particularly to the people of the <em>Súnda</em> districts. Those of
higher rank, those employed about court, or in administering
to the pleasures or luxuries of the great, those collected into
the capitals or engaged in the public service, are frequently
profligate and corrupt, exhibiting many of the vices of civilization
without its refinement, and the ignorance and deficiencies
of a rude state without its simplicity. The people in the
neighbourhood of Batavia are the worst in the Island, and
the long intercourse with strangers has been almost equally
fatal to the morals of the lower part of Bantam. The population
collected at the native capitals is naturally influenced,
to a certain extent, by the vices of the court; but the further
they are removed from European influence and foreign intercourse,
the better are their morals and the happier are the
people.</p>

<p>In attempting to exhibit some of the more striking features
of the Javan character, it becomes necessary to distinguish
between the privileged classes of society and the mass of the
people. Long continued oppression may have injured the
character of the latter, and obliterated some of its brighter
traits; but to the former, the constant exercise of absolute
dominion has done a more serious injury, by removing every
salutary restraint on the passions, and encouraging the growth
of rank and odious vices. In the peasantry we observe all
that is simple, natural, and ingenuous: in the higher orders
we sometimes discover violence, deceit, and gross sensuality.</p>

<p>Where not corrupted by indulgence on the one hand, or
stupified by oppression on the other, the Javans appear to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Vol I Pg 277]</a></span>
a generous and warm-hearted people. In their domestic relations
they are kind, affectionate, gentle, and contented; in
their public, they are obedient, honest, and faithful. In their
intercourse with society, they display, in a high degree, the
virtues of honesty, plain dealing, and candour. Their ingenuousness
is such, that as the first Dutch authorities have
acknowledged, prisoners brought to the bar on criminal
charges, if really guilty, nine times out of ten confess, without
disguise or equivocation, the full extent and exact circumstances
of their offences, and communicate, when required,
more information on the matter at issue than all the rest of
the evidence. Although this may, in some degree, be the
result of the former use of torture, it cannot be wholly so.</p>

<p>Though not much addicted to excess, and of rather a slow
temperament, they are in general liberal and expensive,
according to their means, seldom hoarding their wealth, or
betraying a penurious disposition. Fond of show and pomp,
they lay out all their money, as soon as it is acquired, in the
purchase of articles of dress, horses, splendid trappings, &amp;c.:
but they possess a quality which is not always joined with a
love of splendour, either in nations or individuals; they are
cleanly in their persons, and pay the greatest attention to
neatness, as well as to glare and finery.</p>

<p>Hospitality is universal among them; it is enjoined by
their most ancient institutions, and practised with readiness
and zeal. The Javans are exceedingly sensible to praise or
shame<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>, and ambitious of power and distinction; but their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Vol I Pg 278]</a></span>national oppressions or agricultural habits have rendered
them somewhat indifferent to military glory, and deprived
them of a great portion of their ancient warlike energy. They
are more remarkable for passive fortitude than active courage,
and endure privations with patience, rather than make exertions
with spirit and enterprize.</p>

<p>Though living under a government where justice was seldom
administered with purity or impartiality, and where, of
course, we might expect to see the hand of private violence
stretched out to punish private wrong, or a general spirit of
retaliation and insidious cruelty prevailing, the Javans are,
in a great degree, strangers to unrelenting hatred and blood-thirsty
revenge. Almost the only passion that can urge them
to deeds of vengeance or assassination, is jealousy. The
wound given to a husband's honour by seducing his wife, is
seldom healed, the crime seldom forgiven; and what is remarkable,
the very people who break the marriage tie on the
slightest caprice, or the most vague pretence, are yet uncommonly
watchful over it while it remains entire. They are
little liable to those fits and starts of anger, or those sudden
explosions of fury, which appear among northern nations.
To this remark have been brought forward as exceptions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Vol I Pg 279]</a></span>those acts of vengeance, proceeding from an irresistible
phrenzy, called <em>mucks</em>, where the unhappy sufferer aims at
indiscriminate destruction, till he himself is killed like a wild
beast, whom it is impossible to take alive. It is a mistake,
however, to attribute these acts of desperation to the Javans.</p>

<p>That such have occurred on Java, even during the British
administration, is true, but not among the Javans: they have
happened exclusively in the large towns of Batavia, <em>Semárang</em>,
and <em>Surabáya</em>, and have been confined almost entirely
to the class of slaves. This phrenzy, as a crime against
society, seems, if not to have originated under the Dutch,
certainly at least to have been increased during their administration,
by the great severity of their punishments. For
the slightest fault, a slave was punished with a severity which
he dreaded as much as death; and with torture in all its
horrid forms before his eyes, he often preferred to rush on
death and vengeance.</p>

<p>Atrocious crimes are extremely rare, and have been principally
owing to misgovernment when they have occurred.
In answer to what has been asserted concerning robberies,
assassinations, and thefts, it may be stated, that during the
residence of the English, an entire confidence was reposed in
the people, and that confidence was never found misplaced.
The English never used bars or bolts to their houses, never
travelled with arms, and no instance occurred of their being
ill used. The Dutch, on the contrary, placed no confidence:
all their windows were barred, and all their doors locked, to
keep out the treacherous natives (as they called them), and
they never moved five miles abroad without pistols and
swords. What could be expected by a government that
derived a principal part of its revenue by the encouragement
of vice, by the farms of gaming, cock-fighting, and opium
shops? After the two former were abolished by the English,
and the local government had done all in its power to discourage
the latter, a visible amelioration took place in the
morals of the lower ranks.</p>

<p>Hordes of banditti, formidable for their numbers and audacity,
formerly infested some parts of the country, particularly
the provinces of Bantam and Chéribon; but since they have
been dispersed by the strong hand of government, the roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Vol I Pg 280]</a></span>
of Java may be travelled in as much security as those of
England.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the indolence of the Javans, by
those who deprived them of all motives for industry. I shall
not again repeat what I have formerly on several occasions
stated on this subject, but shall only enter a broad denial of
the charge. They are as industrious and laborious as any
people could be expected to be, in their circumstances of
insecurity and oppression, or as any people would be required
to be, with their advantages of soil and climate. If they do
not labour during the whole day, it is because such persevering
toil is unnecessary, or would bring them no additional
enjoyments. The best refutation of the charge of indolence
is to be found in the extent of their cultivation, the well
dressed appearance of their rice fields, and the abundant
supplies of their harvests. They generally rise by daylight:
at half-past six they go out to the rice fields, where they
employ their buffaloes till ten, when they return home, bathe,
and refresh themselves with a meal. During the violent heat
of the noon they remain under the shade of their houses or
village trees, making baskets, mending their implements of
husbandry, or engaged in other necessary avocations, and at
about four return to the <em>sáwahs</em> to labour them, without
buffaloes or other cattle. At six they return to their homes,
sup, and spend the remainder of their time till the hour
of rest (which is generally between eight and nine) in little
parties for amusement or conversation, when the whole village
becomes a scene of quiet content and pleasure. The same
round of toil and relaxation is observed during the season for
garden culture, dry field labour, or other employments.</p>

<p>Under this system, the villagers seem to enjoy a greater
degree of happiness than they could derive from those increased
means that would result from increased exertion. I
can bear testimony to their general cheerfulness, contentedness,
and good humour, for having visited their villages at all
seasons, and often when least expected or entirely unknown,
I have always found them either pleased and satisfied with
their lot when engaged at their work, or social and festive in
their hours of pleasure. One observation generally made and
admitted, would seem to militate against this part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Vol I Pg 281]</a></span>
Javan character; they are remarked to be envious and jealous
of one another's success: but if this trait of character be with
difficulty reconciled to their general reputation for contentedness
and benevolence, it is surely still more inconsistent with
that indolent apathy with which they are often charged.</p>

<p>It will appear throughout their history, that when strongly
excited by the animosities of the constant wars in which they
were engaged, they were frequently guilty of acts of great
barbarity: such as decapitating a vanquished enemy, and
kicking his head about like a football. In war and politics,
much is not to be said in their favour, stratagem and intrigue
being relied upon in preference to discipline, courage, or good
faith: even the Chinese, during what is called the Chinese
war on Java (A.D. 1750), would appear to deserve a higher
character for bravery and good faith than the Javans. But it
is reasonable to attribute this, in some measure, to the degrading
influence of European despotism. A great disregard
for the <em>little people</em> is shewn throughout their political history,
as is particularly exemplified in the instance of a mock
battle that was fought between the Chinese and Javans, near
<em>Semárang</em>, in order to impose upon the Dutch. The Chinese
wished to know how they should act upon the occasion.
"Attack the whole army of the Javans by surprize," said the
Javan negotiators," but be careful not to kill any of the
chiefs or great people, and it will be a sham fight."</p>

<p>Of their nationality it may be observed, that ever since the
first arrival of Europeans, they have neglected no opportunity
of attempting to regain their independence. A reference to
the chapters on history will be sufficient to illustrate this, as
well as to shew the national feeling on the encroachments
and assumptions of their European rulers. In the great
cause of national independence all would unite, but they
seem hardly to be sufficiently advanced in civilization to effect
such an object, without the risk of relapsing into many barbarities,
from the practice of which they have been weaned,
by a long continuance of established government and general
tranquillity. Quiet and peaceable as the Javans now are,
were they once roused to insurrection, their blood would
rapidly boil, and they would no doubt be guilty of many
excesses.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Vol I Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>I might illustrate the Javan character still further by a
comparison of it with the Malayan, by shewing, from the
remains of those customs that are to be referred to an anterior
and milder system, how much it has been altered by the
introduction of Mahomedanism, and by giving an estimate of
the effects produced upon it by the government of the Dutch;
but this would anticipate some observations which will be
more appropriate in other parts of this work.</p>

<p>Of the causes which have tended to lower the character of
the Asiatics in comparison with Europeans, none has had a
more decided influence than polygamy. To all those noble
and generous feelings, all that delicacy of sentiment, that
romantic and poetical spirit, which virtuous love inspires in
the breast of an European, the Javan is a stranger, and in the
communication between the sexes he seeks only convenience,
and little more than the gratification of an appetite. But the
evil does not stop here: education is neglected and family
attachments are weakened. Among the privileged orders,
the first wife is generally selected by the friends of the party,
from motives of interest, and to strengthen family alliances,
and the second is rather to be considered as the object of the
husband's choice. But if his circumstances admit of it, he
has no scruple to entertain other women as concubines, who
hold an honourable rank in his household. The progeny
from these connections is often immense. It has already
been stated, that a Javan chief has been known to have
upwards of sixty acknowledged children; and it too often
happens, that in such cases sons having been neglected in
their infancy, become dissipated, idle and worthless, and
spring up like rank grass and overrun the country, or serve
but to fill up a long and useless retinue. Fortunately for the
peasantry, who are the mass of the population, they have
escaped this deteriorating institution; and perhaps much of
the comparative superiority of the character of the peasantry
over that of the higher orders is to be attributed to this
advantage. The higher orders have also been more exposed
to the influence of Mahomedanism and European innovation;
and if the former has removed from their usages some traits
of barbarism, and tended to the developement of their intellectual
qualities, it has introduced Mahomedan vices; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Vol I Pg 283]</a></span>
the European power having gradually obtained its supremacy
over the island, rather by stratagem and intrigue than by open
conquest, it is probable that the necessity under which the
natives found themselves to resist its encroachments by
similar means, has powerfully contributed to corrupt their
natural ingenuousness. It is not at the court of the sovereign,
penned up as he now is, and kept like a bird in a cage by
the intrigues and power of the European authority, that we
are to look for the genuine character of the people; neither
is it among those numerous chiefs and petty chiefs attendant
on the European authorities, who by continual association
have, in a great degree, assimilated with them. What we
have said of the Javans must therefore be considered, as
more particularly applicable to the peasantry or cultivators,
who compose three-fourths of the whole population, and is
to be received with some reserve in its application to the
higher classes.</p>

<p>Thus far I have given a faithful representation of the people
as they appeared to me; but it may be amusing to the reader
to read the Javan character, as transcribed from the impressions
of the Dutch. The following is an official account<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of
this people given by a subject of that nation, which has contributed
so much to depress and degrade them.</p>

<p>"If the Javan is a person of rank, or in affluent circumstances,
he will be found superstitious, proud, jealous,
vindictive, mean, and slavish towards his superiors, haughty
and despotic towards his inferiors and those unfortunate
beings that are subject to his orders, lazy and slothful.</p>

<p>"The lower class is indolent and insensible beyond conception,
and although certain persons, who presume to be
perfectly acquainted with the character of the Javan, maintain
the contrary, still I am convinced by daily experience, that the
Javan in general is most shockingly lazy, and that nothing
but fear of his superior, and apprehension of being punished,
or momentary distress or want, can compel him to labour. If
left to himself, he will do no more than what is absolutely
requisite to furnish the necessaries of life, and as he needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Vol I Pg 284]</a></span>
but little, his labour is proportionate: yet as soon as he has
a sufficiency for four days, or for the next day only, nothing
will put him in motion again but force or fear.</p>

<p>"Cowardly, vindictive, treacherous, inclined to rob and to
murder rather than work, cunning in evil practices, and unaccountably
stupid (supposed intentionally,) if any good is
required of him. These are the principal traits of the Javan
character.</p>

<p>"The <em>Maláyu</em>, speaking of him as an inhabitant of this
island, because I am unacquainted with the character of
those living at a distance, is possessed of a little more courage
and activity, fond of small trade and travelling, and
but seldom a robber like the Javan, whom in other respects
he very much resembles. A <em>Maláyu</em>, who is a little cunning,
will, as soon as an opportunity offers, commit a fraud,
especially when he has had some loss which he wishes to
retrieve."</p>

<p>Others of the colonists, and some particularly who are likely
to have greater influence with the restored government, entertained
more correct, because more favourable opinions of the
Javans, coinciding nearly with those which I have stated as
my own.</p>

<p>The following extracts are intended to convey some notion
of Javan ethics. The first is from a popular work, called
<em>Raja Kapa-kapa</em><a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Níti sástra</em> is a work of the greatest celebrity on Java:
the original is in the <em>Káwi</em> language, but there are many versions.
The following is translated from a modern version in
the present language of Java.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>"Praise be to <em>Batára Gúru</em>, who is all powerful! to <em>Batára
Vishnu (wísnu)</em>, who purifieth the minds of men! and
to <em>Batára Súria</em>, who enlighteneth the world! May they
render their divine assistance to the author who composeth
this work, <em>Níti Sástra</em>, which contains an account
of the truths to be found in the sacred writings, and
which are highly necessary to be known by all public
officers.</p>

<p>"A man who cannot regulate his conduct according to circumstances,
and to the situation in which he may be
placed, is like unto a man who has lost the senses of
taste, and enjoyeth not the advantage of <em>síri</em>, for such a
man doth not shine in the world, however fair may be his
appearance.</p>

<p>"A man who is ignorant of the sacred writings, is as one who
has lost his speech; for when these become the conversation
of other men, he will be under the necessity of remaining
silent.</p>

<p>"It is an abomination to the Divinity to worship him in an
unclean place; and the man who does so may be compared
to one who eats another man's bread without his
consent. The food is unwholesome to him, even as if he
ate of his own bread with aversion, in which case he re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Vol I Pg 286]</a></span>sembles
the poor man who overeats himself and afterwards
suffers from hunger.</p>

<p>"A woman who takes not a husband until her hair becomes
grey and her teeth fall out, is despicable in her own eyes,
because men will no longer feel any inclination to her.</p>

<p>"A man, to be accounted able, must know how to adapt his
words to his actions and his actions to his words, so that
he may give offence to no one, but render himself agreeable
to his companions: he must also know how to command
in war, and to inspire his followers with courage.</p>

<p>"In order to obtain this distinction, a man must conduct
himself towards his equals even as a lover conducts himself
towards his mistress; for as the lover cannot obtain
his object without flattery and indulgence, so must we
strive to obtain the good will of mankind by flattering
them occasionally, and by indulging them in those things
to which they are most inclined, and which consists, if
we are in company with religious men, in treating of religious
matters, and if in company with warriors, in treating
about war. This will not only make them like us the
better, but at the same time, excite them to excel in their
profession.</p>

<p>"The subtle nature of the snake, and the venom of its poison,
as well as the ferocious disposition of the tiger, may be
removed by sympathetic remedies; the wild elephant
may also be tamed by means of the well-known small
iron hook: but the fierceness of the warrior, when once
in close engagement, is not to be tamed, unless his enemy
surrender; and even then not entirely, for although the
vanquished surrender, it is to be inferred that he still harbours
resentment for the loss of his freedom, and the conqueror
must keep a lively watch over the vanquished,
lest he still oppose him.</p>

<p>"It is well known that waters, however deep, may be fathomed;
but the thoughts of men cannot be sounded.
In order to know the nature of another, we must attentively
observe his appearance, his manner of speaking,
and his judgment; and if a man gives himself out as a
holy man, it must be proved by his observance of the ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Vol I Pg 287]</a></span>vice
of the Deity and his knowledge of the sacred writings.</p>

<p>"Such a man is distinguished, who is able to expound all
abstract expressions.</p>

<p>"A rich man, who maketh not use of his riches in procuring
for himself good food and clothing, is an abomination,
and ought not to be admitted into the society of the
learned or men of rank; neither ought a man, who has
learnt a profession or studied religion, but who still continues
attached to his idle and vicious propensities.</p>

<p>"The man who advances in years, and he who is too lazy to
labour, and does nothing but eat and sleep, is like a sheep,
which is useless except on account of its flesh.</p>

<p>"It is said, that neither the ravens nor the <em>gadárbo</em> birds,
are good for man; but much less are such men who having
once embraced a holy life, return to worldly pursuits,
or such as can find it in their hearts to seduce the wives
and daughters of their friends to commit adultery.</p>

<p>"The water in a vessel which is only partly full will by the
least agitation splash on the sides: experience also
proves, that the cow which has the loudest voice gives
the least milk. So it is with men: those who have
least understanding or wealth make the greatest noise and
show; but in reality they are inferior, and all they say
and do vanisheth like smoke.</p>

<p>"Friends must be faithful and forbearing towards each
other, otherwise the consequences will be fatal to both.
Of this we have an example in the fable of the tiger and
the forest.</p>

<p>"The forest and the tiger lived together in close friendship,
so that no one could approach the forest, for the tiger was
always in the way; nor the tiger, for the forest always
afforded him shelter. Thus they remained both undisturbed,
on account of the mutual security they afforded
to each other; but when the tiger abandoned the forest
and roamed abroad, the people seeing that the tiger had
quitted it, immediately cut down the forest and converted
it into plantations: the tiger, in the meantime, taking
shelter in a village, was seen by the people, who soon
found means to kill him. In this manner, both parties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Vol I Pg 288]</a></span>
by abandoning their mutual duties to each other, were
lost.</p>

<p>"A child ought, in every respect, to follow in the footsteps of
its father; but this is seldom the case, either among men
or animals in general. Among the latter, however, there
are three sorts which follow their parents in every respect:
all kinds of fish, frogs, and tortoises. The first
and second spawn in water, which is carried away until
the young are produced, when they again join their parents:
the last lay their eggs in holes, and as soon as
the young are hatched they follow the old ones into the
water.</p>

<p>"Man, although he is borne in his mother's womb a long
time, and after his birth is taken care of and nourished,
still seldom follows in the footsteps of his parents. If his
father is a holy man, he ought to follow the same profession;
but instead of this, children do not generally attend
to the advice of their parents, nor to the lessons of the
sacred writings, or those given by holy or good men.</p>

<p>"That men of rank should do every thing in their power to
attach the lower class of people to them, is not only proper
but necessary, in order to keep them faithfully to
their duty. To this end, therefore, men of rank ought to
be indulgent and liberal towards their inferiors, like a
woman who implores the assistance of man to bring
forth children and support her; but not like a tigress that
brings forth its cubs, nor the snake which brings forth so
many young, that sometimes having no food for them or
for herself, she devours them.</p>

<p>"Man is pleased with the <em>dódot</em> cloth (apparel), and women
are proud of their bosom; but a good man prefers the
sacred writings, which may lead him to the life to come.</p>

<p>"Property obtained by man's own labour is valuable, but
more valuable is that which is obtained by a man's blood
in time of war: of less value is property inherited from
a man's parents. Of little value is the property taken
from a man's parents or his wife, but still less valuable is
that which comes to a man from his children.</p>

<p>"It is the duty of the chief of the nation to inquire into every
thing which can affect his subjects; to know whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Vol I Pg 289]</a></span>
they are prosperous or not, if every one attends to his
duty, if they are skilful in the execution of it or not, and
in all cases to take measures accordingly, never losing
sight of justice. He must, as far as possible, be lenient
in the punishment of the guilty, and liberal in the reward
of the deserving; particularly in the field of battle, when
in sight of the enemy, when presents ought then to be
distributed to the soldiers (<em>prajúrit</em>), in order to animate
them; for if ever so justly treated, they will not, except
they have been obliged by their commander, either be
so faithful, or risk so much in an attack against the
enemy.</p>

<p>"Highly prejudicial is it for the chiefs to discover fear before
their enemies, for in that case the men will also be afraid;
but when the chiefs conduct themselves in such a manner
as to shew they do not fear the enemy, then the men are
animated by their example.</p>

<p>"A chief should keep his plan of attack as secret as possible,
because the knowledge of it may enable the enemy to be
on his guard, and turn the measures taken to his own
advantage. He ought not to challenge his enemy to give
battle, as in that case the enemy will have an opportunity
of preparing himself for the same: but he should attempt
to surprize him, and rush upon him like a fire, that quickly
and without much noise consumeth all with which it
comes in contact.</p>

<p>"The most formidable enemy of a man is his own conscience,
which always brings his crimes before his eyes, without
leaving him the means of avoiding it.</p>

<p>"The most valuable and lasting friendship is that which
exists between persons of the same rank.</p>

<p>"The severest misfortune which a man can suffer, is to be deprived
by force, of the land upon which he lives and
which he has cultivated, or to have his wife and children
taken from him by force.</p>

<p>"Man loveth nothing more than his own children, and he
always esteems his own feelings in preference to those of
others.</p>

<p>"Of all birds the <em>chíong</em> (miner) is the most highly prized,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Vol I Pg 290]</a></span>
because it has a beautiful appearance and can imitate
the speech of man.</p>

<p>"A woman who loves her husband so tenderly, that at his
death she wishes to die with him, or surviving never
marries again, but lives as if she were dead to the world,
is valued above all others of her sex.</p>

<p>"The lessons of our parents are like the lessons of the ten
wise masters. No master con be called wise, unless he
attends to what is written, as well on sacred as on worldly
subjects. Such a master may be justly called a superior
mortal; for it is a difficult task to learn and to attend to
the same, even as difficult as to catch and tame a wild
elephant on the edge of a precipice without injury.</p>

<p>"Melancholy is it to see a young man of condition unacquainted
with the sacred writings; for, be he ever so
gracefully formed or elegant in his manners, he remains
defective; like the <em>wúrawári</em> flower, which, notwithstanding
its fine appearance and bright red colour, emits
no fragrance whatever.</p>

<p>"No man can be called good or bad, until his actions prove
him so. Thus if a man declares that he has never taken
any but delicious food, it will be shewn in his appearance.
If he is stout and well looking, then may he be credited;
but if, on the contrary, he is poor and lean, then it is impossible
that he should have lived on good food.</p>

<p>"In like manner, when a man pretends to be the friend of
mankind, it must be proved by his behaviour when he
receives the visits of others. If he receives his guests
with kindness and hospitality, then is he the friend of
mankind, otherwise he is not so. And further, if a man
pretends to have fasted and prayed, and to have become
a holy man, it will be known whether he is really so,
by the success which attends the prayers which he puts
up for another: if the Deity hears them not, then is he a
deceiver.</p>

<p>"A caterpillar has its poison in its head, a scorpion in its
tail, and a snake in its teeth, but it is unknown in what
part of the body the poison of man is concealed: a bad
man is therefore considered poisonous in his whole frame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Vol I Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"A child which is indulged by its parents in every thing, is
like a young fish in a clear and pure stream, in which
it grows and sports, unconscious whither it may lead.</p>

<p>"As the strength of a bird is in its wings, so does the power
of a prince consist in his subjects; but then only through
the means of persons properly informed on the following
points. First, how a country ought to be properly administered;
secondly, how to please a prince; thirdly,
how to prepare all delicacies for him; and fourthly,
how to preserve discipline and direct the conduct of an
army.</p>

<p>"The dread of the subject should be such, that the orders of
the prince should be to him like a clap of thunder, that
may be heard far and wide.</p>

<p>"A man who does evil to his companions acts against the
sacred writings and the lessons of his instructor: he can
never enjoy prosperity, but will meet with misfortunes in
all his proceedings. Such a man is like a piece of porcelain,
which when it falls to the ground breaks into many
pieces and can never be rendered perfect.</p>

<p>"A field without pasture is not frequented by cattle, neither
does a river without water contain fish. An instructor
who knoweth not how to perform the duties of his situation
can have but few disciples, and a prince who pays
little regard to his country and subjects, will in time not
only lose his fame and glory, but his authority also.</p>

<p>"It is well known that a man cannot take the goods of this
world with him to the grave, and that man after this life
is punished with heaven or hell, according to the merits
of his actions in this life: a man's duty, therefore, requires
of him to remember that he must die; and if he
has been merciful and liberal in this life to the poor, he
will be rewarded hereafter. Happy is the man who
divides his property equally between himself and the indigent,
who feeds the poor and clothes the naked, and
relieves all who are in distress; he has hereafter to expect
nothing but good.</p>

<p>"The following animals, as being injurious to the health of
man, are not proper to be used by him as food: rats,
dogs, frogs, snakes, worms, monkeys, lizards, and the lik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Vol I Pg 292]</a></span>e.</p>

<p>"A handsome man is an ornament to the community, and
one that has good manners besides, is an ornament to his
prince; but he who understands the sacred writings is
the pride of the community and a delight to his prince.</p>

<p>"A prince who wishes to know his subjects well, ought to
be attentive to their manners, actions, and courage; and
as gold is known by the touchstone, or broken into pieces
in order to ascertain its intrinsic value, so ought a prince
to try his subjects, before he intrust them with the charge
of his women or treasure, and make himself acquainted
with their valour and knowledge: for a person who does
not possess the qualifications required for this purpose,
is unworthy to associate with people of condition, and
much less to be the servant of a prince.</p>

<p>"If a man violates the law, he may for the first offence be
punished by a pecuniary fine, for the second by punishment
affecting his person, but for the third offence he may
be punished with death.</p>

<p>"A joy generally followed by sorrow is that which we feel in
borrowing money. We feel happy in having obtained what
we wished, but as soon as our creditors come for their money,
our joy is converted into grief; and that is the greatest
when the money is spent, and we have not wherewith to
satisfy our creditors: then arise quarrels and ill will, and
yet no sooner are these settled than we again have recourse
to the old habit of lending and borrowing.</p>

<p>"Laughing and joking at our companions is also a bad custom,
for it generally begets quarrels, and is thus the cause
of grief.</p>

<p>"Should medicine be mixed with poison, we would naturally
separate the poisonous parts before we swallowed it, and
we would also clean rusty metal in time before it becomes
rusty and corroded. In the same manner we should distinguish
between the good and bad actions of man, rewarding
knowledge and opposing evil: and be it recollected,
that a woman, however low her birth, if her manners
are amiable and her person good, may without impropriety

<p>"Riches only tend to torment the mind of man, and sometimes

and despised by the wise. They are collected
with pain and troubles in afterwards administering them;
for if we neglect to watch them properly, thieves will
come and steal them, and the loss occasions as much
grief as the point of death.</p>

<p>"Therefore is it advisable to give part of our property to
the poor and indigent, who will thence naturally become
under obligations to us, and not only assist in guarding
our property against all accidents, but pray that our property
may increase, being themselves interested in our
success, and our names will be blessed by our children

<p>"As dykes cannot long resist the force of water, unless the
water is allowed a free current and a place to pass
through, so riches cannot long be enjoyed, unless employed
for charitable purposes; but, on the contrary,
they will turn to the injury of the possessor, both here
and hereafter, who will be exposed to the wrath of all the

<p>"<em>Batára gúru</em> is cool, still colder is the moon; but the coolness
of neither is to be compared to that which is instilled
by the voice of a holy man. Fire is hot, still hotter is the
sun; but neither is to be compared to the heat of a man's
heart.</p>

<p>"Like those flies and birds, which fly in the air to procure
food, and still continue to feed on filth and dirt, is the
man of bad character; for although he may have the
means of procuring an honest subsistence, still will he
continue to take what he should not, by unlawful means,
to the prejudice of others. But a good man wishes the
success of another, and is happy when his brother prospers.</p>

<p>"As the moon and stars enlighten the night, and the sun enlighteneth
the day, so do the Holy Scriptures enlighten
the hearts of men; and a son who is superior in knowledge
to his father, is a light to his family.</p>

<p>"A child accustomed to nothing but amusement, neglects
the lessons of its parents. The child on this account,
often abandoned to its fate, becomes a dangerous subject;
it is therefore essential that a child should be kept under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Vol I Pg 294]</a></span>
subjection while it is yet time to prevent its committing
any bad acts. For this purpose these rules should be
attended to:</p>

<p>"A child under five years of age may be indulged in many
things; but afterwards it must be kept under strict subjection,
and instructed in the knowledge of the Holy Writings
until its tenth year, when a commencement may be
made to instil that sort of knowledge which will form the
intellects for the benefit of society. After the sixteenth
year further instruction must be given in the higher and
more important branches of knowledge.</p>

<p>"Man should always be on his guard against the commission
of wicked acts, for the end of them is always pain
and misery.</p>

<p>"A man must, on no account, listen to the advice of a woman,
be she ever so good; for the end of it will be death and
shame: but he must always consult his own mind in
what he has to do or not to do, never losing sight of the
lessons of his instructors. Thus, not only will he obtain
knowledge, but his actions will be good.</p>

<p>"Riches, beauty, knowledge, youth, and greatness often lead
a man into error; he, therefore, who is blessed with any
of them ought to be, at the same time, humble and generous,
for then he will excel; otherwise, his virtues will
be hidden.</p>

<p>"As the man who advances by fair means from poverty to
riches, or from insignificance to greatness, is rewarded in
this world, so will he who is generous and kind-hearted
be rewarded hereafter in heaven. So will the warrior
killed in battle, who is like a conqueror, enjoy all the delights
imaginable; while a deserter is despised by all
men, and covered with shame and disgrace, because he
deserted his comrades in the moment of danger.</p>

<p>"No man ought to be termed a hero but he who has already
conquered a hundred heroes; nor should any man be
termed a holy man until he can boast of surpassing in
virtue a hundred holy men: for as long as a hero has not
conquered a hundred heroes, or a holy man has not surpassed
a hundred other holy men in virtue, he can neither
be considered as a real hero or holy man.

<p>"The signs of the approaching end of this world will be all
kinds of depravity among mankind; that is to say, the
wise will turn foolish, the holy men will become worldly,
children will abandon their parents, princes will lose
their empires, the little will become great, and commit
depredations; in short, every thing will be in confusion,
and an entire revolution take place.</p>

<p>"In the beginning every thing was at rest and quiet. During
the first thousand years princes began to start up, and
wars arose about a woman named <em>Déwi Darúki</em>: at this
period writing was first introduced. One thousand five
hundred years after this another war began, about a woman
named <em>Déwi Sínta</em>. Two thousand years after this
a third war broke out, about a woman named <em>Déwi Drupádi</em>:
and two thousand five hundred years afterwards
another war took place, about the daughter of a holy man
not named in history.</p>

<p>"Every man can thus see what has been the first cause of
war. Even as the roots of trees and the course of rivers
cannot run straight, but wind here and there, so cannot
a woman be upright: for the saying is, that a raven can
sooner turn white, and the <em>tanjang</em>-plant (a water lily)
grow from a rock, than a woman can be upright.</p>

<p>"A perfect man should be, in firmness and ability, equal to

<p>"A bad man is like a fire, which inflames every thing which

with an intention to extinguish it. A good man, on the
contrary, is like a sweet-scented tree, which continues to
produce flowers and fruit, pleasant to the taste and smell
of every one, and the fragrance of which remains in the
wood even after the tree is cut down and rooted out.</p>

<p>"When a harlot begins to feel shame, then is her improvement
approaching; but when a holy man begins to

<p>Intimately connected with the character, moral and intellectual,
of a people, are its civil and political institutions. In
a country like Java, the frame of society is so simple, the
hand of power is so universally felt or seen; rank, wealth,
and authority are so identified, and the different classes of the
community are so referable to each other, by contrast or reciprocal
influence, that it was impossible to give any account
of the state of the peasantry, or of the tenure and distribution
of the land, without introducing some notices concerning
government and revenue. As there is little division of labour
among a rude people, so there is no division of power in a
despotism: the despot is proprietor, all the rest is property.</p>

<p>The Island of Java appears at different times to have been
divided into states of greater or smaller extent. History informs
us, that it was at one period under the sway of one
principal chief, and at others subject to two or more. In the
former case, the provinces into which it was divided were administered,
as they are still, by subordinate and delegated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Vol I Pg 297]</a></span>
governors; and in the latter, many of them composed independent
sovereignties. In all these cases, the form of government
and the privileges of the people were the same; the
only difference between a state co-extensive with the Island,
and one limited to a few districts, consisting in the different
extent of territory or number of subjects at command. In
looking at the map, the divisions of the Island now under
European dominion, and those under the native princes,
can easily be traced. Bantam (the sultan of which surrendered
his rights to the British government for a pension of a
few thousand dollars), and Chéribon, an extensive province
to the eastward of Batavia, enjoyed till lately a nominal independence;
but the only great native power on Java, till the
establishment of <em>Yúg'ya-kerta</em> about sixty years ago, was that
of the <em>Susuhúnan</em>, or as he is termed, the Emperor of Java;
and a slight sketch of his government, of the maxims by
which it is regulated, and the officers it employs, will be sufficient
for my present purpose.</p>

<p>The sovereign is termed either <em>Susuhúnan</em> or Sultan, both
denominations adopted since the establishment of Mahomedanism:
the titles previously employed were <em>Kiaí Gedé</em>,
<em>Prábu</em>, <em>Browijáya</em>, &amp;c. as will be perceived on reference to
the list of Hindu princes in the historical details. The line
of succession to the throne is from father to son, but the
rights of primogeniture are not always allowed or observed.
If there is no direct descent, the claims of collateral branches
of the reigning dynasty are settled by no law or uniform custom.
Females have sometimes held offices of power, but
have never occupied the throne since the establishment of
Mahomedanism. The chiefs of districts and the heads of
villages are sometimes women; in that case widows continued
in the office of their deceased husbands.</p>

<p>The government is in principle a pure unmixed despotism;
but there are customs of the country of which the people are
very tenacious, and which the sovereign seldom invades.
His subjects have no rights of liberty of person or property:
his breath can raise the humblest individual from the dust to
the highest distinction, or wither the honours of the most
exalted. There is no hereditary rank, nothing to oppose his
will. Not only honours, posts, and distinctions, depend upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Vol I Pg 298]</a></span>
his pleasure, but all the landed property of his dominions remains
at his disposal, and may, together with its cultivators,
be parcelled out by his order among the officers of his household,
the members of his family, the ministers of his pleasures,
or the useful servants of the state. Every officer is paid by
grants of land, or by a power to receive from the peasantry a
certain proportion of the produce of certain villages or districts.</p>

<p>When a sovereign enjoys unlimited power, he generally
in eastern countries surrenders it for ease and pleasure,
and his servant, under the name of Vizier or some other
title, becomes the despot. The highest executive officer or
prime minister in the Javan government is called <em>Ráden Adipáti</em>:
he usually rules the country while his master is satisfied
with flattery, with pomp, and the seraglio. He is intrusted
with power so great, as even, in particular cases, to
extend to the royal family. All communications to and from
the sovereign are made through him: he receives all reports
from different parts of the country, and issues all orders. The
power and importance of this office has, however, naturally
lessened of late years, since the European government has
assumed the right of nominating the person who shall fill it:
the sovereign naturally reposes less confidence in a prime
minister so nominated than in one of his own choice; and if
he does not take an active part himself in the politics of his
court, he is generally under the influence of an ambitious
member of his own family, by which means the <em>Ráden Adípati</em>,
or prime minister, though left to conduct the details of government,
is often ignorant of many of the intrigues carried on in
the place.</p>

<p>The gradations of power and rank are as follow.</p>

<p>After the royal family, which includes the prince or sovereign,
called <em>Susuhúnan</em> or <em>Sultan</em>, and the sons and daughters
of the sovereign, called <em>Pangérans</em>, the heir apparent being
called <em>Pángéran Adipáti</em>, come the nobility, and at their head
the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em>.</p>

<p>The nobility or privileged orders may be classed under the
two general divisions of <em>Bopátis</em>, and their immediate assistants
or <em>Pátehs</em>, and <em>Mántris</em> or public officers. <em>Bopáti</em> is the general
term given to the governors of provinces, being the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Vol I Pg 299]</a></span>
plural of <em>Adipáti</em>. This, however, is rather a title of office
than of mere rank, as these governors are sometimes <em>Tumúng'gungs</em>,
<em>An'gebáis</em>, and of still inferior rank. <em>Adipáti</em> appears
to be the highest title below royalty. The dignity of this
title, as well as that of others, is again raised, by prefixing
the epithet <em>Kiai</em> (venerable) or <em>Mas</em> (golden), as <em>Kiai-adipáti</em>,
<em>Kiaí-tumúng'gung</em>, <em>Mas-adipáti</em>, <em>Mas-tumúng'gung</em>. <em>Ráden-tumúng'gung</em>
is also occasionally used, to express a rank
above an ordinary <em>Tumúng'gung</em>, in the same manner as
<em>Ráden Adipáti</em>.</p>

<p>These officers, when appointed to the administration of
provinces, are called Regents by the Dutch. Since the innovations
of Europeans, the distinctions above referred to have
been a good deal confounded. In the <em>Súnda</em> districts, where
the absolute sway of the native sovereign has long ceased to
be felt, and in the eastern provinces, which are subject to
Europeans, the Regent assumes the state of a petty sovereign,
and is the fountain of honour. The power and rank attached
to particular titles, especially those of inferior importance,
differs in some degree in almost every province.</p>

<p>The sons of the Regents, or of those who may be properly
termed the nobles of the country, are usually called <em>Rádens</em>,
and in the <em>Súnda</em> districts invariably so; but there is properly
no hereditary nobility, no hereditary titles, although few people
have a greater respect for family descent than the Javans;
custom and consideration, in this as in other cases, generally
supplying the place of law.</p>

<p>Nearly the same form of government is followed in the
administration of each particular province as is observed in
the general administration of the country, every <em>Adipáti</em>, or
governor of a province, having a <em>Páteh</em>, or assistant, who acts
as his minister. In general there is a <em>Páteh-luar</em>, and a
<em>Páteh-dalam</em>; one for conducting affairs abroad or public
business, the other for the superintendence of the household.</p>

<p>The same union of the judicial, revenual, and executive
authority, which exists in the sovereign, descends to the
governor of a province; and if there are subdivisions of the
province, it descends to each head of the subdivision. This
is also the case with each village; the consequence of which
is, that every chief, of whatever rank, has an almost absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Vol I Pg 300]</a></span>
power over those below him. The only exception to this, and
the only part of the Javan constitution which wears the
appearance of liberty, is the mode of appointing the heads of
villages; these are elected by the people, as will be hereafter
more particularly described.</p>

<p>In every considerable province or district there are several
subdivisions over which an inferior chief presides: the district
of <em>Semárang</em>, for instance, has several. Although this
absolute authority is vested in the different chiefs, according
to their ranks, it is dangerous for a public functionary, whatever
be his rank, and even for the <em>Susuhúnan</em> himself, to violate
what is called the custom of the country; and the ancient Hindu
institutions are revered and generally followed by all classes.
The priests also exercise a considerable influence; and
although the power of the <em>Jáksa</em>, or law officer, is essentially
reduced since the establishment of Mahomedanism, and a
great part of his authority transferred to the <em>Panghúlu</em> or
Mahomedan priest, he is still efficient, as far as concerns the
police and minor transactions. The observations which
follow on the administration of justice and the judicial instructions
established by the British government, will explain
the present nature of his duties.</p>

<p>In the suite of every governor of a province, of his <em>Páteh</em>,
or assistant, and of every public functionary of importance,
are numerous petty chiefs, generally classed as <em>Mantris</em>, but
having various titles, as <em>Demángs</em>, <em>Lúras</em>, <em>Klíwons</em>, &amp;c.
varying in authority and relative rank in different districts.</p>

<p>Three-fourths of the island having been long subjected to
the European authority, and the provinces which still remain
under native administration having been divided under two
distinct authorities, and their original constitution otherwise
departed from, it would be impossible to lay down a scale of
rank for the different titles of honour, which should be applicable
to every part of the island, but the subject will be
resumed in a future chapter.</p>

<p>The following observations of Mr. Hogendorp, who resided
on Java not many years before the arrival of the English, and
was employed in a commission of inquiry into the state of
the island, are extracted from a report or memoir which he
drew up for the use of the Dutch government, recommending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Vol I Pg 301]</a></span>
a policy similar to that which we subsequently pursued. They
contain a just account of the principles of the Javan government,
and of the state of the Regents under the Dutch
Company. After remarking, in perhaps too broad and unqualified
terms, that the structure of the government is feudal, he
proceeds to state:</p>

<p>"The first principles of the feudal system, which form the
basis of the whole edifice, are: that the land is the property
of the sovereign; that the inhabitants are his slaves,
and can therefore possess no property, all that they have
and all that they can obtain belonging to the sovereign,
who allows them to keep it no longer than he chooses;
and that the will of the prince is the supreme law.</p>

<p>"These are the real fundamental principles of the feudal
system: for though the English and French kings could
not always maintain their despotic sway, but were sometimes
opposed, hostilely attacked, and even forced by arms
to treat for terms with their subjects, this was only the
natural consequence of the acknowledged rule, that
<em>tyranny destroys itself</em>; and it is only necessary to revert to
what James and Charles of England, in so late a period,
thought their divine rights of royalty, to ascertain what
were the rudiments of the feudal form of government: and
even now, notwithstanding the numerous changes and
revolutions which have happened in England, the most
surprizing traces of that system are to be found, since
in that country, so free, no individual soever possesses a
foot of land in absolute property (allodium), but merely
from the king (feodum), to whom only belongs the <em>dóminum
absolutum et directum</em>, although subsequent laws and
regulations have rendered this title more imaginary than
real.</p>

<p>"The same system of government has been continued
in the Company's districts, under the pretext of allowing
the natives to retain their own laws and customs, but in
reality from ignorance and self-interest. Although they
were too ignorant to effect any improvement, they knew
perfectly well that this plan was the best adapted to promote
their own interest and advantage.</p>

<p>"The princes of Java, as well as those of Europe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Vol I Pg 302]</a></span>
former times, and as a natural effect of the same cause,
were also almost continually at war with their chief vassals,
until the Dutch power and influence re-established and
maintained the general tranquillity. This, however, has
never had any effect on the system of government itself,
and the subject who dethroned his sovereign and then succeeded
him, thought that he had thereby obtained the same
<em>divine right</em> of property in the lands and persons of his
subjects, as his predecessor had possessed.</p>

<p>"The princes allotted the lands to their chiefs and immediate
dependents, as rewards for military and other services.
These chiefs (termed by the Dutch regents) again subdivided
the lands among others of inferior rank, on the
same conditions, and so on, down to the poor labourer who
cultivated the land, but to whom a very small proportion
of the fruits of his labour was left for his own support.</p>

<p>"The exclusive administration of the country was conferred
on the regents, an appellation given to the native
chiefs, who had acquired their lands from the Dutch, by
contract or agreement, binding them annually to deliver
partly for payment and partly not, a quantity, in some cases
fixed, in others uncertain, of the produce of such lands,
obliging them also to the performance of feudal services,
both of a military and other nature.</p>

<p>"The titles of these regents are either <em>Adipáti</em>, <em>Tumúng'gung</em>,
or <em>Ang'ebái</em>. The Prince of <em>Madúra</em>, styled <em>Panambáhan</em>,
and the Prince of <em>Súmenap</em>, who is called <em>Pangéran</em>,
are however only regents as well as the rest. The
Prince of <em>Madúra</em> enjoys that tide as being of the imperial
family, and the Prince of <em>Súmenap</em> purchased his by a
large payment to a Governor-General.</p>

<p>"These regents are only officers of government, and possess
not the smallest right to hereditary possession or succession.
Yet when one of them dies, he is in general replaced by one
of his sons, considered most fit for the office, provided he
can afford to pay the customary present to the governor of
the north-east coast of Java; for if he is unable to do this,
or if any other person offers a more considerable sum, a
pretence is easily found to exclude the children in favour
of the more liberal purchaser.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Vol I Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"These presents form a principal part of the emoluments
of the governor of the north-east coast, and consequently
all new appointments of regents are for his advantage.
The present chief regent of <em>Samárang</em> paid 50,000 dollars
for his promotion, and all the children of his predecessor
were superseded. The others pay in proportion to the
value of their regencies; and as this is arbitrary and uncertain,
it is easily to be conceived, that they find means
to recover the amount of their place-money<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>"These Regents although very proud, are, with very few
exceptions, ignorant and idle persons, who give themselves
little concern about their lands and their people; of whom,
indeed, they frequently know nothing, but only endeavour to
squeeze and extort from them as much as possible, both for
their own subsistence and pleasure, and to satisfy the cupidity
of government and of their immediate superiors. They
leave the administration of affairs entirely to their <em>Pátehs</em>,
who are also appointed by the Dutch, and are held accountable
for every thing<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Vol I Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>"To their brothers, wives, children, and other near relations,
they assign villages or <em>désas</em>, sufficient for their maintenance,
for all these consider themselves born not to work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Vol I Pg 305]</a></span>and look upon the peasantry as only made for the purpose
of providing for their support.</p>

<p>"In order to collect the rice and other kinds of produce,
which they are by contract obliged to deliver to the Company
as contingents, they compel the inhabitants of the
district to furnish as much of it as is at all possible, without
any fixed ratio or calculation, and without any kind of
payment, leaving them scarcely what is absolutely necessary
for their own support and that of their families, and
even sometimes not nearly so much, especially in the event
of failure in the crops; on which occasions the miserable
inhabitants desert by hundreds to other districts, where, at
least in the first instance, they may expect a less rigorous
treatment. Several regents also, when distressed for money,
are compelled by want, to let out many of their best <em>désas</em>
to the Chinese: these bloodsuckers then extort from such
villages as much as they can possibly contrive, while the
inhabitants of the other <em>désas</em> are alone obliged to deliver
the contingent required from the whole aggregate. It may
easily be conceived, how oppressively this demand must fall
upon those unhappy individuals; and how greatly these
and other acts of injustice, which are the natural consequences
of the present faulty administration, must tend to
the ruin of the country, it would be superfluous reasoning
to prove."</p>

<p>The only restraint upon the will of the head of the government
is the custom of the country, and the regard which he
has for his character among his subjects. To shew what that
character ought to be, what is expected of a good prince, and
what are the reciprocal duties of a prince, prime minister, and
people, I may here quote a few sentences out of the <em>Níti
Prája</em>, a work in very high esteem, and constantly referred to
by the Javans.</p>

<p>"A good prince must protect his subjects against all unjust
persecutions and oppressions, and should be the light
of his subjects, even as the sun is the light of the world.
His goodness must flow clear and full, like the mountain
stream, which in its course towards the sea enriches and
fertilizes the land as it descends. He must consider that
as the withered foliage of the trees awaiteth the coming of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Vol I Pg 306]</a></span>
rain to flourish anew, so are his subjects waiting for his
benevolence, to be provided with food, with raiment, and
with beautiful women. If, on the contrary, a prince neglects
to extend his benevolence and protection towards his
subjects, he exposes himself to be abandoned by them, or
at any rate to lose their confidence; for it is an undeniable
truth, that no one will be faithful or attached to a man upon
whom no dependence can be placed.</p>

<p>"When a prince gives audience to the public his conduct
must be dignified. He must sit upright and not in a bending
posture, and say little, neither looking on one side or
the other, because, in this case, the people would not have
a proper sight of him. He must assume a pleasing appearance,
which will enable him to observe his subjects who
surround him, and then enquire if any one has any thing to
say to him; and if there is, he must animate him to speak
openly.</p>

<p>"In his discourse he must not speak loud, but low, and with
dignity, and not more than is necessary for the purpose; for
it does not become a prince to withdraw his words if once
given, and much less to give them another turn.</p>

<p>"It is, above all, the duty of a prince to take notice of
every thing going on in his country and among his subjects,
and, if possible, to turn every thing to a good end: if he
passes over unnoticed the least crime, he may create numerous
enemies. It is further the duty of a prince, besides
knowing the merits of his subjects and the state of his
country, to explain all abstract and difficult expressions,
particularly such as occur in writings.</p>

<p>"It is a disgrace to a prime minister for any hostile attack
to be made on the country intrusted to his charge without
his knowledge, or that he should be careless or inattentive
to the same, rather thinking how to obtain the favour of his
prince than to secure the safety of the country. So it is
when he does not understand how to administer the country
properly, or fails to invent what is useful; when he makes
many promises, but fulfils few; when he is careless with
regard to public affairs, and talks much about what is of no
consequence, seeking to be admired by the people, and
putting on fair appearances when his intentions do not cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Vol I Pg 307]</a></span>respond;
when he cares nothing about the misfortunes of
his inferiors, provided he gets money himself; when, finally,
he is not faithful, but deceitful. Such a prime minister is
like the hawk, which soars high in the air, but descends
low on the earth to seize and steal its food.</p>

<p>"But a good prime minister is he who is upright in his
heart, moderate in his fear of the prince, faithfully obedient
to all his orders, kind-hearted, not oppressive to the people,
and always exerting himself to the utmost for the happiness
of the people and the welfare of the country.</p>

<p>"And a prime minister is good beyond measure who can
always please his prince in every thing that is good; who
knows every thing that is going on in the country, and
takes proper measures accordingly; who always exerts
himself to avert whatever is likely to be injurious; who
considers nothing too trifling to merit his attention; who
accumulates not wealth, but offers to his prince whatever
comes in his way that is curious; who heeds not his own
life in effecting what is right; who considers neither friends,
family, nor enemies, but does justice alike to all; who cares
not when he is praised or reviled, but trusts to the dispensations
of Providence; who possesses much experience;
who can bear poverty, and cares not for the enjoyment of
pleasures; who is polite to every one; who with good will
gives alms to the poor and helpless; who consults much
with his brother officers, with whom he ought always to
advise on affairs of business. Against such a prime minister
it is impossible for any one to speak, for he will be
feared at the same time that the people will become attached
to him: the people will then live quiet and happy, perform
their labours with cheerfulness, and wish that his administration
may be lasting.</p>

<p>"A prime minister ought, nevertheless, not to be too confident
in this, but always remain on his guard against the
designs of bad men.</p>

<p>"There are many examples of such prime ministers:
among which is <em>Rája Jájahan</em>, (prime minister of <em>Mesir</em>
Egypt,) to whom all the people of the country, great and
small, were much attached.</p>

<p>"Whenever his brother officers intended to visit the prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Vol I Pg 308]</a></span>
for the purpose of paying their respects, they always assembled
at the prime minister's house, where they generally
partook of a meal: after this they proceeded to the court,
followed by the prime minister on foot, dressed in white,
with only three attendants, carrying a spear and other articles
of state before him. By this conduct he supposed
that he was screened from reproach, and that he was freed
from enemies; but at the very time there were enemies
conspiring against his life, as was afterwards discovered:
therefore ought a prime minister not only to be virtuous,
but cautious also, and always armed against his enemies, in
the same manner as a sportsman arms himself against wild
beasts.</p>

<p>"A subject going into the presence of his prince must be
clean and well-dressed, wearing proper <em>chelána</em> (pantaloons.)
He must have a good girdle and a sharp <em>krís</em>, and
be anointed with aromatic oils. He must range himself
with his equals, and convince them of his abilities and
good breeding; because from this it is that he has to expect
favour or disgrace, grief or joy, happiness or misery;
for a prince can either exalt or humble him.</p>

<p>"A prince is like a <em>dálang (wáyang</em> player,) his subjects
like <em>wáyangs</em>, and the law is as the wick of the lamp used
in these entertainments: for a prince can do with his subjects
what he pleases, in the same manner as the <em>dálang</em>
acts with his <em>wáyangs</em>, according to his own fancy; the
prince having the law, and the <em>dálang</em> the lamp, to prevent
them from going out of the right way.</p>

<p>"In like manner, as it is incumbent on the <em>dálang</em> to make
magnanimity and justice the principal subjects of his representation,
in order that the spectators may be instructed
and animated thereby, so should a prince, a prime minister,
and chief officers of the court, direct the administration of
the country with such propriety, that the people may attach
themselves to them; they must see that the guilty are
punished, that the innocent be not persecuted, and that all
persons falsely accused be immediately released, and remunerated
for the sufferings they may have endured."</p>

<p>The judicial and executive powers are generally exercised
by the same individual. The written law of the island, ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Vol I Pg 309]</a></span>cording
to which justice is administered and the courts are
regulated, is that of the <em>Koran</em>, as modified by custom and
usage. The Javans have now been converted to the Mahomedan
religion about three centuries and a half, dating from
the destruction of the Hindu kingdom of <em>Majapáhit</em>, in the
year 1400 of the Javan æra. Of all the nations who have
adopted that creed, they are among the most recent converts;
and it may be safely added, that few others are so little acquainted
with its doctrines, and partake so little of its zeal
and intolerance. The consequence is, that although the Mahomedan
law be in some instances followed, and it be considered
a point of honour to profess an adherence to it, it has
not entirely superseded the ancient superstitions and local
customs of the country.</p>

<p>The courts of justice are of two descriptions: those of the
<em>Panghúlu</em> or high priest, and those of the <em>Jáksa</em>. In the
former the Mahomedan law is more strictly followed; in the
latter it is blended with the customs and usages of the
country. The former take cognisance of capital offences, of
suits of divorce, of contracts and inheritance; they are also,
in some respects, courts of appeal from the authority of the
<em>Jáksa</em>. The latter take cognisance of thefts, robberies, and
all inferior offences; its officers are employed in taking down
depositions, examining evidence, inspecting the general police
of the country, and in some measure acting as public prosecutors:
these last functions are implied in the title of the
office itself, <em>jáksa</em> meaning to guard or watch<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Vol I Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>At the seat of government are supreme courts of the <em>Panghúlu</em>
and <em>Jáksa</em>: to these there is an appeal from similar but
inferior tribunals, established within each province. Petty
tribunals, under like names, are even established under the
jurisdiction of a <em>Demáng</em>, or chief of a subdivision, and sometimes
of a <em>Bákol</em>, or head of a village; but in these the authority
of the <em>Panghúlu</em> and <em>Jáksa</em> extend no further than to
take down evidence to be transmitted to some higher authority,
to settle petty disputes, and perform the ordinary ceremonies
of religion, inseparable among the Javans, as well as
all other Mahomedans, from the administration of justice.</p>

<p>Such however is the nature of the native government, that
these officers are considered rather as the law assessors or
council of the immediate superior officer of the executive government,
than as independent ministers of justice. In such
cases as come before them, they examine the evidence, and
point out the law and custom to the executive officer, who is
himself generally too ignorant and indolent to undertake it.
When the evidence is gone through, and the point of law ascertained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Vol I Pg 311]</a></span>the whole is brought before him, at whose discretion
it rests to pass judgment. It is however admitted, that
in matters of little moment, where his passions and interests
are not concerned, the division is frequently left to the law officers;
but in all matters of importance he will not fail to exercise
his privileges of interference.</p>

<p>The court of justice in which the <em>Panghúlu</em> or high priest
presides, is always held in the <em>serámbi</em>, or portico of the
mosque; a practice, which, as it inspires the people with a
considerable share of awe, appears judicious. It is also convenient
for the administration of oaths, which among the
Javans are always administered within the mosque, and usually
with much solemnity. The forms of the court are regular,
orderly, and tedious; all evidence is taken down in
writing, and apparently with much accuracy.</p>

<p>The court, at least at the seat of government, consists of the
<em>Panghúlu</em>, the officiating priest of the mosque, and four individuals,
also of the religious order, called <em>Páteh nagári</em>,
meaning literally the pillars or supports of the country, to
whom, after the examination of evidence in capital offences,
the point of law and decision is referred. At the seat of government
the sovereign or his minister passes judgment.</p>

<p>The court of the <em>Jáksa</em> at the seat of government consists of
the head <em>Jáksa</em>, who may be styled the law officer of the
prime minister, and the <em>Jáksas</em> of his <em>Klíwons</em> or assistants,
for they too have their law councils. The functions of this
court being of less importance, of a more mixed nature, and
less solemn because less connected with religion, are still
more subject than that of the <em>Panghúlu</em> to the rude interference
of the executive authority<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Vol I Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>The Javan code of law is divided into two departments, that
of the Mahomedan law and that of custom and tradition. The
former is distinguished by the appellation of <em>húcum állah</em>, the
<em>commands of God</em>, from the Arabic; the latter by the Javan
words <em>yúdha nagára</em>, meaning consideration for the country,
or in other words, allowance for the state of society.</p>

<p>The decisions in Mahomedan law are chiefly guided by several
works in the Arabic language. In all the courts of
Java these works are said to be consulted in the Arabic language,
but reference is more frequently made to a collection
of opinions extracted from them, and translated into the
language of the country.</p>

<p>The law of custom is chiefly handed down by oral tradition,
but has in part been committed to writing in the following
performances.</p>

<p>The earliest work relating to jurisprudence which is now
referred to, is that of <em>Júgul Múda Páteh</em>, or minister of <em>Sri
Ma Púng'gung</em> (of <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>), now <em>Wirosári</em>: it is
computed to be about six hundred years old. The second
bears the name of <em>Rája Kápa</em>, said to have been the son of
<em>Júgul Múda</em>, and like him minister of his sovereign <em>Kandiáwan</em>,
also prince of <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>.</p>

<p>By the authority of the Sultan of <em>Demák</em>, the first Mahomedan
prince, a compilation of the Javan laws was made, in
which they were in some measure blended with the Mahomedan
jurisprudence. Probably this was intended to pave the
way to an entire introduction of Mahomedan law. The body
of regulations, &amp;c. compressed in these codes is curious, from
the laborious refinement of their distinctions, from the mixture
of moral maxims and illustrations with positive law, from the
most incongruous combinations, and from their casuistical
spirit. In the Appendix will be found the translation of a
modern version of the <em>Súria Alem</em>, a work of this description
in high repute, as well an abstract of the laws and regulations
said to have been in force in the earliest periods to which
Java tradition refers<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Vol I Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>The proclamations (<em>úndang-úndang</em>), and the laws and
regulations (<em>ánger ángeran</em>) of the sovereign, form another
source of deviation from the Mahomedan law. Collections
of these have been committed to writing.</p>

<p>The prince, by himself or his officers, is always supposed
vested with a discretionary power of adapting the Mahomedan
law to the circumstances of society, a prerogative liberally
exercised. This power, which sanctions every deviation from
the letter of Musselman law, the Javans also express by the
term of <em>yúdha nagára</em>. The krising of criminals instead of
beheading them, the combat of criminals with tigers, the
severe penalties for infractions of the sumptuary laws of the
Javans, the constant commutation of corporeal punishment
for a pecuniary fine, and in the case of persons of rank found
guilty of murder, the commutation of the strict law of retaliation
for a fine, without regard to the wishes of the relations of
the deceased, if the latter be of no consideration, were among
the deviations from the Mahomedan law sanctioned by the
<em>Yúdha nagára</em>.</p>

<p>Such was the composition of the courts, and the code of
laws that existed on Java before the arrival of the Dutch, and
remained unchanged at the conquest of the island by the
British. The Dutch legislated for the colonists, but took
little interest in the system by which the judicial proceedings
of their native subjects were guided, excepting in so far as
their own advantage or security was concerned in them. The
following statement contains the changes introduced by the
Dutch.</p>

<p>Besides the colonial laws and regulations, enacted from time
to time by the Governors and Council at Batavia; besides
some standing orders of the Court of Directors, and some
rules and provisions contained in the successive charters of
the Company, and in what was called the <em>article brief</em>; the
Dutch law, which was always considered the foundation of
the colonial law, was of authority, as far as it remained unaffected
by these institutions.</p>

<p>A collection of the colonial statutes and regulations, called
the <em>Placart</em> Book of Batavia, and an abstract of them, entitled
the <em>Statutes</em> of <em>Batavia</em>, were made under the authority
of the colonial government; but as the latter never underwent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Vol I Pg 314]</a></span>
a regular promulgation, the rules contained in it were not considered
as possessing the force of law, except in so far as they
might be found to be conformable to the orders, proclamations,
and regulations of the Indian government, or of the Directors
of the East India Company.</p>

<p>The power of the Directors and of the Council of Batavia
to enact local laws and regulations, seems not to have been
very circumspectly defined in the first charters of the Company,
those charters conferring on them, in general terms only,
authority to provide for the administration of justice and establishment
of police.</p>

<p>But from the nature of the occasion it seems evident, that
this power of making colonial laws, as far at least as related
to the Council of Batavia, could only have been a limited
one, to be exercised with considerable discretion, and only
upon points requiring an immediate provision, subject always
to the approbation of the authorities at home; and even the
Directors could hardly be considered to have possessed a
greater extent of legislative power, than was necessary for the
security of their new territories, and of their rights and privileges,
or to have been authorised to deviate wantonly from
the established law of the country, or neglect the dictates of
justice and equity.</p>

<p>In the great variety of matter comprehended in the colonial
statutes, no subject seems to have occupied more attention
than the laws respecting slavery. These, as already observed,
appear to have been formed in general upon principles of
humanity and consideration for the condition of the unfortunate
beings to whom they related.</p>

<p>In consequence of a resolution of the year 1760, the Council
of India ordered that the customs of the Mahomedans, in matters
of inheritance and successions <em>ab intestat</em>, &amp;c. should be
sanctioned and published.</p>

<p>In civil matters, natives and Chinese in the districts of
Batavia seem to have been governed by the same laws as the
European inhabitants.</p>

<p>Crimes committed by natives or Chinese in the city of
Batavia and its environs, had, from the first settlement of the
Dutch on the island, always been tried by European judges,
and according to European law.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Vol I Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>In Bantam the criminal jurisdiction over the natives was
left to the Sultan, and that over the Chinese resident there,
was exercised as at Batavia according to the European law.</p>

<p>The <em>Jakatra</em> and <em>Priáng'en</em> Regencies seem formerly to
have enjoyed a peculiar and fortunate state of tranquillity.
Almost entirely removed from every communication and intercourse
with Europeans, Chinese, and other foreign settlers
found in the neighbourhood of Batavia, engaged in agriculture,
and ruled by their own native chiefs, these districts seem
to have been in a high degree free from crime; but whenever
enormities did happen, the offenders were sent down to Batavia,
and tried according to European law. It is to be observed,
however, that on the first submission of those districts
to the Company, their chiefs or regents reserved to themselves
the jurisdiction over the inhabitants of their respective districts;
but this stipulation appears to have been disregarded
in the latter times of the Dutch Company, and under the late
administration of Marshal Daendals, a court was established
for these districts, the rule of which was European law.</p>

<p>From Chéribon the Chinese were amenable, as from Bantam
and Batavia; but the natives were subject to a <em>landraad</em> (or
local court), of which the Resident was president, and the
Sultans members; and this court was, partly at least, directed
by a <em>papákam</em>, or native code, compiled under the sanction of
the government.</p>

<p>In the Eastern districts of the island, the Javans seem
always, in criminal matters, to have enjoyed their own laws,
founded on ancient custom and the precepts of the <em>Koran</em>.
Of these laws the Council of Batavia caused abstracts to be
printed, for the guidance of the great <em>landraad</em> or high court
at <em>Semárang</em>, to which all the Javans in the European provinces,
from <em>Losári</em> to <em>Banyuwángi</em> were amenable.</p>

<p>Under the native government, the prime minister (<em>Ráden
Adipáti</em>) is the head of the police, as well as every other department
of authority. The higher class of functionaries is
most frequently to be found in those parts of the country most
remote from the seat of government, where, as governors of
provinces, they possess some extension of powers. The great
and fertile provinces near the capital, on the other hand, are
divided into small appropriations, of from two hundred to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Vol I Pg 316]</a></span>
thousand <em>cháchas</em>, or families, placed under the administration
of division officers, whose authority is limited to the duties of
police.</p>

<p>Each village is possessed of a distinct organization within
itself, has its chief, its <em>Kabáyan</em> or assistant, and if of any
considerable size, its priest, whose advice is frequently had
recourse to, and who generally decides petty disputes, especially
respecting divorces and matters of inheritance. The
chief of the village is not without his share of judicial authority,
and often takes upon himself to punish by fine and
imprisonment. In each village the inhabitants keep regular
nightly watches and patrols.</p>

<p>The manner in which these little societies have been recently
formed in the districts to the east of <em>Surabáyu</em>, where
the European authority had not interfered, and where the influence
of the Mahomedan government was scarcely felt, will
tend to illustrate their nature and constitution.</p>

<p>The frequent wars, in which the people had been engaged
with the inhabitants of <em>Báli</em> and <em>Madúra</em>, as well as with the
Dutch, had reduced those provinces to a state of wilderness
towards the middle of the last century. The encouragement
held out to the people of the neighbouring island of <em>Madúra</em>
brought over several adventurers, who were allowed to occupy
the land they cleared; first rent-free, and afterwards at a fixed
assessment. If several persons came together, their leader
was invested with the authority of <em>Petíng'gi</em> over the new
village which they formed. When individuals associated to
construct a village, the chief was elected by themselves, subject
to the approval of the landlord; and they possessed the
privilege, common in all the districts east of <em>Surabáya</em>, of
annually electing their chief, or <em>Petíng'gi</em>.</p>

<p>The nature of the duties rendered by this person was so
essential to the well-being of a village, that this privilege was
most intimately connected with its existence. Whenever a
new assessment was imposed on the lands, it was the business
of the <em>Petíng'gi</em>, if the amount was too high, to represent the
matter to the superior, and to state the inability of the people
to make good the demand: the consequence was, either a
reduction of assessment on the part of the principal, or
desertion on that of the people. But when the amount of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Vol I Pg 317]</a></span>
assessment was considered reasonable (and any amount less
than three-fifths seems to have been so considered), the
<em>Petíng'gi</em> had to assemble all the people, and to distribute to
each, in the common presence of all, his individual proportion
of land, with a statement of the produce to be paid. He
had to keep a roster of all duties required of the people, and
to see that every man took his proper turn. When the harvest
ripened, he had to watch the collectors, that they exacted no
more from each man than his proportion; and the cultivator,
that he did not embezzle any part of the due of government.
In large villages he had an assistant, called a <em>Kabáyan</em>, who
represented him during his absence, and with the <em>Kamitúah</em>
and <em>Múdin</em> (priest), formed a court for settling petty village
disputes; subject, however, to a reference, if the parties
should be dissatisfied.</p>

<p>It was customary for the people of the village to cultivate
the lands of their <em>Petíng'gi</em> without payment. This and the
honour of chiefship rendered the office an object of village
ambition; while an annual election, and the fear, if turned
out, of being called upon to justify his conduct, rendered this
officer generally a steady and careful representative of his
constituents.</p>

<p>All strangers passing through the country were expected to
apply to the <em>Petíng'gi</em> for the assistance they required; and
if payment was tendered, all procurable necessaries were
furnished. The <em>Petíng'gi</em> also took charge of the strangers'
property, examined the same in the presence of the other
head-man, and was bound to return the whole undiminished
the next morning, or to pay the value. If, however, the
stranger preferred keeping his property under his own charge,
and rested himself for the night under some of the public
sheds, the loss he might sustain fell on himself alone, and all
he could procure from the village was assistance to trace the
offenders.</p>

<p>It was customary, as well to deter beasts of prey as thieves,
for a part of the men of each village to keep a night watch
round it, and to perform this duty in successive rotation.</p>

<p>Such appears to have been the internal regulation of these
villages; and it seems to have been framed according to the
ancient usage of the island, the similarity of which to that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Vol I Pg 318]</a></span>
Western India has been adduced as a strong instance of one
common origin<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Vol I Pg 319]</a></span>

It follows from the above, that each village has in itself the
materials of a good police, and that a right of choosing their
chiefs gives to the people a considerable share of real liberty<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.
This right of election in the inhabitants of the village, as
before observed, would appear at one time to have been
general throughout the island. It is still respected in the
districts of <em>Surabáya</em>, where the office of <em>Petíng'gi</em> was
always elective, for although the same person might hold it
for many years, a ballot for the situation was regularly held
at specified periods, varying from one to three years<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.</p>

<p>The right of election is also clearly acknowledged in the
districts of <em>Japára</em> and <em>Jawána</em>. "That the <em>Petíng'gi</em> is
elected by the inhabitants of a village," observes the officer
who introduced the settlement into those districts<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>, "there
cannot be a doubt; and even the right of election is
foregone by the people, though I have not met with a
single instance of the kind, it may be taken for granted,
that it is so only, in consequence of the influence of the
Regent, to serve some particular purpose. While the
<em>Petíng'gi</em> continues in office, he is looked up to and obeyed
by the people of the village to which he belongs as the immediate
chief. He generally occupies the <em>paséban</em> usually
to be found in villages of consequence, and has two or
more men, inhabitants of the village, appointed to attend
him wherever he goes. A <em>Petíng'gi</em> was usually elected for
one year, during which time he could not, according to the
ancient usage, be removed, except in consequence of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Vol I Pg 320]</a></span>gross misconduct, but if his conduct was such as to give
satisfaction to the inhabitants, they continued him for
several years. As far as I could learn," continues the same
officer, "the Regent, or other superior native authority,
seldom interfered in the election of a <em>Petíng'gi</em>; but it was
generally understood, that although he could not force a
<em>Petíng'gi</em> upon them who was disliked by the people, his
confirmation was required before the person elected could
act with effect."</p>

<p>In the <em>Súnda</em> districts of <em>Chéribon</em> and <em>Tegál</em>, the appointment
to this office is invariably made, if not by the election
of the villagers, generally from among themselves, and always
with their concurrence. It is a common practice for the
people of a village, even where the right of election is not in
use, to represent in a body the conduct of their chief, if incorrect;
and it has always been necessary for the chief native
authority to remove him, if the complaints were justly
founded.</p>

<p>A reference to the judicial regulations in the Appendix<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
will show how desirous the British government on the island
has been to protect the privileges of these societies, and in
particular the right of electing their chief.</p>

<p>When the British authority was established on the island,
it was immediately seen that something must be done to
supply the deficiencies, and to correct the imperfections of
the native code. All the other changes in contemplation for
the encouragement of industry and for the abolition of oppressive
and impolitic exactions, would have been nugatory,
without such an improvement in the judicial and police regulations,
as would secure, by a full and impartial administration
of justice, the rights and privileges about to be conferred. It
would have been in vain to define the limits of power, to issue
directions for guiding the conduct of public servants in their
transactions with the people, or to have abrogated the oppressive
privileges of the chiefs, and to have assured the people
of the intention of government to protect them against all
invasion of their rights, either by open violence, by the
exaction of services, or by oppressive contributions, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Vol I Pg 321]</a></span>
establishing effective means of obtaining redress when
aggrieved. The system acted upon was at once barbarous
and revolting. Practices prevailed under the sanction of
native law, which were abhorrent to the criminal jurisdiction
of any enlightened nation, without being at all necessary to
the due administration of justice<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. I allude particularly to
torture and mutilation. These the Earl of Minto immediately
abolished, by his proclamation of the 11th September 1811,
in which, besides this beneficial and humane enactment, he
laid down clearly and distinctly the liberal and enlightened
principles which should guide the local government in the
subsequent revision of the civil and criminal code of the
colony. The result was the enactment of the code of judicial
and police regulations which will be found in the Appendix
to this work<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>. The outlines of these regulations, and the
principles which dictated them, are contained in a Minute
which I recorded on the 11th February 1814, when they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Vol I Pg 322]</a></span>completed and promulgated; and the following quotations
from that document may be sufficient to put the reader in
possession of the change which was effected.</p>

<p>"It was essential, in conducting the revenue arrangements,
that the measures taken for the establishment of a good
and efficient police, and the full and impartial administration
of justice throughout the island, should preserve an
equal pace.</p>

<p>"Rights were not to be bestowed and defined, without
a suitable provision for their being effectually guarded
against any invasion; and it became an object of the first
moment, to form such an adequate and consistent code of
regulations, as should serve, in every instance, to guide the
executive officers of government in the performance of their
duty, and to make known, and secure to the people, the
means of obtaining redress, whenever they felt themselves
in any way aggrieved.</p>

<p>"The system found existing on our first arrival was at once
complicated and confused. In the principal towns there
were established courts, but these were constituted in all
the troublesome formalities of the Roman law; and in the
different residencies were provincial courts, styled <em>land-raads</em>,
where the native form and law was left to take its
course, with all its barbarities and tortures.</p>

<p>"The Dutch government, proceeding entirely on the system
of commercial monopoly, paid very inferior attention to
their internal administration. They had little other connexion
with their best subjects, the cultivators of the soil,
than in calling on them, from time to time, for arbitrary and
oppressive contributions and services; and for the rest, gave
them up to be vassals to the various intermediate authorities,
the Regents, <em>Demángs</em>, and other native officers.
These either at first purchased their situations, or stipulated
for a certain tribute, in service or money, in consideration
of which all the inferior classes of inhabitants were
made over, to be dealt with by them as most pleasing to
themselves. Policy, and the common attention to their own
good, suggested to these a certain equity of procedure, and
it was generally the custom to leave each village to its own
management, with respect to police and settling the petty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Vol I Pg 323]</a></span>
quarrels that occurred within its limits; but for the continuance
of what was good in such a system, there was no
security whatsoever, and oppression and injustice must have
constantly occurred. Where the will of the lord was the
paramount law, his vassals could only have depended on
his natural goodness of disposition for being equitably
treated. No remedy was afforded where the reverse was
the case, and they possessed, in short, no security, no freedom
whatsoever.</p>

<p>"On the propriety of the measures to be adopted by us to
remedy such evils, no doubt could exist.</p>

<p>"The first proclamation of the enlightened founder of the
present government adverted immediately to this subject.
As a step that could not, consistently with British ideas,
admit of a moment's delay, it instantly ordained, that torture
and mutilation should no longer make part of any sentence
to be pronounced against criminals; and it then proceeded
to define clearly the relative situation of the English and
Dutch inhabitants, laying down rules for the future guidance
of government concerning them. This proclamation,
dated 11th September, 1811, has long been before the world,
and it would be superfluous, in this place, to dwell on that
love of justice and benevolence of disposition, which is to
be traced through every part of it. It forms the basis of the
present respective European rights in this colony<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p>"As a continuation of the measures so ably sketched out by
my predecessor, I issued the proclamation, dated the 21st
January, 1812.</p>

<p>"In this I attempted to simplify the clumsy and unwieldy
structure of the former courts, by abolishing some, lessening
the number of the judges in the remaining ones, and by defining,
as accurately as I could, the limits of their respective
jurisdictions.</p>

<p>"It was found that, formerly, there were separate courts
for investigating the conduct of the immediate European
servants of the Dutch Company, and of Europeans not included
in that service. This distinction, as Lord Minto
observed, never could have been grounded on any sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Vol I Pg 324]</a></span>
principle, and it being resolved, that justice, under the
British government, should be administered equal and alike
to all classes and denominations, the judicial power of the
College of Schepenen was abolished, and transferred to the
jurisdiction of the courts of justice.</p>

<p>"The great number of judges who, under the Dutch administration,
formed a court, was reduced in each to a president
and three members.</p>

<p>"One court was established in each of the three principal
towns, Batavia, Semárang, and Surabáya, the jurisdiction
of which extended over its European inhabitants; proceeding,
in civil cases, in the mode before established, but in
criminal ones, so as to conform as much as possible to that
established in Great Britain; in all cases confronting the
prisoner with the evidence, and a jury being called to judge
of the fact on the evidence so adduced.</p>

<p>"To relieve these courts from numerous inconsiderable
causes, courts, of the nature of Courts of Requests, were
also established in these three towns, for the recovery of
small debts.</p>

<p>"For matters of police within the towns, magistrates were
appointed; but they were ordered to confine themselves
entirely to this branch.</p>

<p>"An abuse which had been discovered to be usual, the
compounding crimes and offences, in consideration of a sum
of money paid to the Fiscal or other officer, had also met
with Lord Minto's most severe reprehension, as being one
of an abominable nature, and to be suppressed without
delay. The practice was accordingly strictly prohibited,
and consonantly with British ideas was termed scandalous.</p>

<p>"Thus much had been done with regard to Europeans,
and it has been found fully sufficient.</p>

<p>"But with respect to the native inhabitants of the Island,
it was to be expected that much greater changes would be
necessary.</p>

<p>"In the first instance, it was ordered that courts should be
established in the different districts, in which the chief
civil authorities should preside, aided by the Regents and
other native officers, for the purpose of hearing and trying
all causes in which natives only were concerned; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Vol I Pg 325]</a></span>
amount of their civil decisions, when exceeding fifty dollars,
being submitted for confirmation to the courts of justice;
and all criminal cases, of a capital nature, being made over
by them to judges of circuit, who were ordered to be sent
on this duty twice a year, from among the members of the
superior courts.</p>

<p>"Thus much was known not to militate either against the
principles of universal and natural justice, or against the
particular laws and usages of the country; and thus much
was only, at first, done, because it was resolved to obtain
the fullest knowledge of the subject, with regard to the
manners, habits, and institutions of our native subjects,
before we established one general code of regulations for
the internal administration of the country.</p>

<p>"In effecting this grand object, it was rather my wish to
have it maturely and well done, than by accelerating it too
much, to run the risk of taking up a crude system, which
would require to be afterwards re-considered, and perhaps
entirely new modelled.</p>

<p>"On the principle, however, which would eventually guide
me, there was no doubt, nor is it necessary for me to dilate
on the impolicy, the inconvenience, or the injustice, of subjecting
the natives of Java to any other laws, than those of
their ancient government and established faith.</p>

<p>"The tranquillity of the country and the duties of police
have been provided for, by preserving the original constitution
of the villages, and continuing the superintendence
and responsibility in the hands of those, whose rank enables
them to exert a due influence, and to command respect.
For the administration of justice, the duties of the Resident,
as judge and magistrate, have been considerably extended.
In civil cases, the mode of proceeding, and the establishment
of petty courts, are founded on the practice of the
country; in criminal, the jurisdiction and authority of the
Resident has been considerably extended. Hitherto, his
duties had been strictly confined to police; but considerable
delay and injury to the parties accused, as well as to the
witnesses, had been occasioned by allowing all causes of a
higher nature to lie over for the Court of Circuit: and as
the separation of the collection of the Revenue would afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Vol I Pg 326]</a></span>
more time to the Resident, it was resolved to extend the
criminal jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts to all cases, in
which the punishment for the crime alleged does not amount
to death. In these courts, which instead of being termed
<em>Landraad</em>, as heretofore, are now styled the <em>Resident's
Courts</em>, the <em>Panghúlu</em>, or chief priest, and the superior,
<em>Jáksa</em>, or native fiscal, attend to expound the law. The
<em>Bopátis</em>, or Regents, with their <em>Pátehs</em>, are present, to aid
and assist the Resident with their opinion in the course
of the investigation, but they have no vote in the decision.
If the opinion of the law officers appears to the Resident to
be according to substantial justice, and is in accordance
with his own opinion, the sentence is immediately carried
into effect, provided the punishment does not extend to
transportation or imprisonment for life.</p>

<p>"In cases where the punishment adjudged is more considerable,
or wherein the opinion of the law officers may be
at variance with that of the Resident, a reference is to be
made to the Lieutenant Governor; and in all cases where
the punishment for the crimes charged is of a capital nature,
the prisoner is committed to jail, to take his trial before the
Circuit Judge.</p>

<p>"On the first establishment of the Courts of Circuit, it was
directed that the President and one other member of the
Courts of Justice, should proceed once in six months, or as
much oftener as circumstances might require, to the different
Residencies in their several jurisdictions, for the trial of
offenders. Much inconvenience, however, was found to
arise from the absence of those members of the courts from
the towns in which they were established, as it necessarily
followed, that all civil business was at a stand while they
were away. On the other hand, to prevent delay on the
trial of criminals, it was necessary that they should visit the
Residencies more frequently than once in six months.</p>

<p>"To remedy this in future, and to provide for the prompt
and due administration of justice among the native inhabitants,
in a manner that is not repugnant to their notions of
right and wrong, one member of each of the courts of justice
has been appointed a Judge of Circuit, who will be present
in each of the Residencies at least once in every three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Vol I Pg 327]</a></span>
months, and as much oftener as necessary. In the mode
of proceeding, they are to avoid the formalities of the Roman
law. A native jury, consisting of an intelligent foreman
and four others<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, decide upon the fact: the law is then
taken down, as expounded by the native law officers, and
the sentence, with the opinion of the Judge of Circuit, and
on the application of the Dutch and Colonial law on the
cases, is forwarded for the modification or confirmation of
the Lieutenant Governor.</p>

<p>"Hitherto the jury required by the Court of Circuit, did
not exceed five in number, and these, as justly observed,
'were chosen from a class of men (Europeans) who had no
common feelings, no common rights; who were, in no
shape or consideration, the equals of the person tried.
The law was the law of Europe. The jury, under their
best prejudices, were influenced by that law; and its
meanings and penalties were applied to people who reason
in a different manner, and who often never knew any thing
of the laws of Europe, before they found themselves its
convicted victims.'</p>

<p>"The general jurisdiction of the Courts of Justice at Batavia,
Semárang, and Surabáya, is now confined to Europeans
and foreigners and to the inhabitants of those towns
and their suburbs; and a line has been drawn, which distinctly
separates the police of the country from that of the
towns.</p>

<p>"Collections of the different law-books and institutions of
the country are now making, and a native establishment
has been formed at Buitenzorg, under my immediate superintendence,
for examining and revising the judicial proceedings,
and for affording to the native inhabitants that
facility of appeal, which the remoteness of the Government,
and the rules of Dutch administration, did not formerly admit
of, but which is so consonant to the principles on which
the new system of internal economy has been established."</p>

<p>Under the native government, the whole of the male population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Vol I Pg 328]</a></span>
capable of bearing arms was liable to military service;
but the number of people required to cultivate the land, and
to perform other public services, did not admit of more than
one-third being spared for military purposes, except in cases
of extraordinary emergency. The extent of the force permanently
kept up by the sovereign in time of peace varied, of
course, with the probability of approaching hostilities: when
this was smallest, the number seldom exceeded what was
required for the state and pomp of the court, and might have
amounted to four or five thousand men. Until within the last
sixty years, when the Dutch first obtained a supremacy over
the whole island, the provinces under the native administration
had for several centuries been in a continual state of warfare;
but since that period the military spirit has been gradually
subsiding, and, by the existing treaties with the native
princes, they are restricted in the number of troops which they
may maintain. Those of the <em>Susuhúnan</em> are limited to a body
guard of one thousand men: such further number as may be
required for the tranquillity of the country, the European government
undertakes to furnish.</p>

<p>Before the native sovereign was under this restriction, he
used to raise the requisite force by a demand upon the governor
of each province for a specified number, to be furnished
at a certain time, varying according to circumstances. The
governor or chief of the province apportioned this demand
among the subdivisions, and the village chiefs selected from
among the villagers as many as were required of them; and
thus, in a country where every man wears a <em>kris</em>  or dagger,
and the spear or pike is the principal military weapon, an
army, or rather a numerous armed mob, was easily collected
in a few days. The men furnished from the villages, and of
whom the mass of every large army necessarily consisted,
were distinguished from the soldiers by profession (<em>prajúrit</em>),
by the term <em>árahan</em>, or <em>prajúrit árahan</em>. During their absence
from home, they were provisioned by the sovereign, and
their wives and families were maintained by the head of the
village, who required of the remaining cultivators to assist in
working their fields or gardens.</p>

<p>The sovereign, as the head of the military and the fountain
of military honour, assumes among his titles that of <em>Senapáti</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Vol I Pg 329]</a></span>
or lord of war. When an army is to be raised, he appoints a
certain number of his chiefs to be <em>widánas</em>, or commanders of
corps of three hundred and twenty men. Under each <em>widána</em>
are four <em>lúrahs</em> or <em>tíndihs</em>, who command companies of eighty
men, and have each two subaltern officers, called <em>babákals</em> or
<em>sesábats</em>, each having the command of forty men. The <em>widánas</em>
were remunerated for their services by grants of land, to the
amount of a thousand <em>cháchas</em>, from which they had again to
make assignments for the maintenance of the inferior officers,
who were always nominated by them.</p>

<p>When troops march through the country, or supplies are
required, a demand is made upon the neighbouring districts,
which are obliged to contribute according to their means,
without payment. When in an enemy's country, the troops,
of course, subsist by plunder, the disbursement of money for
provisions or supplies being unknown.</p>

<p>The native armies of Java consisted chiefly of infantry, but
the officers were invariably mounted, and when cavalry was
required, each province furnished its quota: the troops,
whether on foot or mounted, joined the army properly equipped
for action. It was thus unnecessary for the sovereign to keep
up a store of arms. Each village has its provision of spears,
and sometimes of fire-arms; the officer of subdivision keeps a
further reserve for contingencies; and as the chief of the
province is responsible for the proper equipment of the men,
he generally has also a further store to supply any deficiency.</p>

<p>Of the different weapons used in Java, the most important
and the most peculiar to the Eastern Islands is the
<em>krís</em>, which is now worn by all classes, and as an article of
dress has already been noticed.</p>

<p>The Javan <em>krís</em> differs from the Malayan, in being much
more plain, as well in the blade as in the handle and sheath:
it differs also in the handle and sheath from the <em>krís</em> of <em>Madúra</em>
and <em>Báli</em>, as may be seen in the plate. The varieties of
the blade are said to exceed an hundred; and as a knowledge
of the <em>krís</em> is considered highly important by the Javans, I
have, in a separate plate, offered specimens of the most
common.</p>

<p>In the plates are also exhibited the different kind of spears,
darts, and other weapons, either said to have been in use for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Vol I Pg 330]</a></span>merly,
or actually used at the present day. These are the
bow and arrow (<em>gendewa</em>, <em>pana</em>) which are seldom used in
modern days, except on state occasions. The arrows, termed
<em>chákra</em>, <em>paspáti</em>, <em>trisúla</em>, <em>waráyang</em>, <em>diwál</em>, <em>róda dedáli</em>, and
others of a similar form, as well as the clubs called <em>indán</em>,
<em>gáda</em>, and <em>dénda</em>, are represented as the weapons used by the
gods, demigods, and heroes of antiquity, and are constantly
referred to in the mythological and historical romances of
the Javans, and exhibited in their scenic and dramatic entertainments.
The <em>túlup</em> and <em>páser</em> represent the tube and the
small arrows which are rendered poisonous by the <em>úpas</em>: these
have not been used on Java for centuries, but they are common
in less civilized islands of the Archipelago, and particularly
on Borneo. The <em>gánjing</em> is an iron bar, formerly used by the
Javans. The <em>bandríny</em>, or sling, is still used with considerable
effect, and was employed in resisting the British troops
in 1812. The <em>pedáng</em>, <em>bandól</em>, <em>badík</em>, <em>golók</em>, <em>mentók</em>, <em>lámang</em>
or <em>klewáng</em>, and <em>chundrík</em>, are varieties of the sword. The
<em>kúdí-tránchang</em> is a weapon which was formerly general on
Java, but not now much used. The <em>wedúng</em> is a peculiar
weapon, in the shape of a chopper, worn on occasions of state
by all chiefs when in presence of the sovereign. Of spears
and darts, there are several varieties distinguished by different
names. Small round shields are still in use; the long shield
is not. The matchlock exhibited in the plate is a representation
of a piece manufactured on <em>Báli</em>.</p>

<p>Besides these instruments of war, the Javans have long been
acquainted with the use of cannon, muskets, and pistols.
Previous to the reduction of <em>Yúgya-kérta</em>, in 1812, by the
British forces, the Sultan cast brass guns of considerable
calibre, and at <em>Grésik</em> they are still manufactured for exportation.
Round the <em>kráton</em> of <em>Súra-kérta</em> are mounted several
very large pieces of artillery, and great veneration is paid to
some of them supposed to have been the first introduced on
the island: two, in particular, are considered to be part of the
regalia. For muskets and pistols they are principally indebted
to Europeans. Gunpowder they manufacture, but to no considerable
extent, and the quality is not esteemed.</p>

<p>From an army raised only on emergency, and composed of
people who do not make the military life a profession, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Vol I Pg 331]</a></span>
discipline cannot be expected. The veneration, however,
which the common people pay to their chiefs, the well defined
gradations of rank, and the devotion with which all
classes are willing to sacrifice themselves in support of their
ancient institutions and independence, seem to render the
Javan troops, while acting under their own chiefs, orderly
and tractable. In their tactics and conduct they endeavour
to emulate the examples given in their ancient romances; and
in the plans for their pitched battles, the march of their armies,
and the individual heroism of their chiefs, they strive to imitate
the romantic exhibitions contained in the poems of antiquity.
In the great <em>Matárem</em> war, for instance, the result
of which was the establishment of the present family on
the throne, the disposition of the army is said to have been
in the form of a shrimp or prawn, as represented in the
plate. This form is termed <em>mangkára</em>, or the shrimp which
hides its soul, alluding to the sovereign who is in the centre
and not to be approached. The plan of this order of battle
is said to have been taken from the poem of the <em>Bráta Yúdha</em>,
and was adopted by <em>Bimányu</em>, the son of <em>Arjúna</em>. The <em>diráda
máta</em> is another form, said to have been used by the army
of <em>Astína</em>, and has likewise been adopted by the modern
Javans<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the bravery and heroism required of a soldier, some notion
has been given in the account of the Javan ethics; and
a reference to their history, for the last three centuries, will
abundantly prove, that although unacquainted with those
evolutions and tactics which contribute so largely to the
power of an European army, the Javans, as soldiers, have
not been deficient, either in personal courage, or in such military
principles as might be expected from the general state
of society among them, and as are well suited to the nature
of the country and the weapons they are accustomed to carry<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Vol I Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the national boast, that it was not so much by force of
arms as by intrigue and stratagem, that the Dutch obtained
the superiority in the country. The history of the Dutch administration
on Java will abundantly testify this, and at the
same time prove, that among Asiatics, there are few nations
who have fought more obstinately in support of their independence
than the Javans. It was by corrupting and bribing
the chiefs, and sowing disunion among them, that the Dutch
succeeded in dismembering an empire, already shaken, at the
period of their arrival, by the constant wars which attended
the establishment of Mahomedanism. The comparison which
has been drawn by the Javans themselves of their own character,
in contrast with that of the Dutch, may serve to illustrate
the nature of the military feeling still existing in the
country. "The Dutch," say they, "are superior to the
Javans, inasmuch as they have good heads; they can calculate,
and they understand policy better, but then they
have cold hearts: the Javans are poor simple beings, but
they love their country and will never quit it; their heart
glows and often burns."</p>

<p>The phrenzy generally known by the term <em>muck</em> or <em>ámok</em>, is
only another form of that fit of desperation which bears the
same name among the military, and under the influence of
which they rush upon the enemy, or attack a battery, in the
manner of a forlorn hope. The accounts of the wars of the
Javans, as well as of the <em>Maláyus</em>, abound with instances of
warriors running <em>ámok</em>; of combatants, giving up all idea of preserving
their own lives, rushing on the enemy, committing indiscriminate
slaughter, and never surrendering themselves alive<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.
Even at present, there are to be found among the Javans men
who profess to be and are considered invulnerable; and there
are some who, by a dextrous manner of receiving the spear,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Vol I Pg 333]</a></span>and other such artifices, completely impose upon the too credulous
people. Nothing is so easy as for an artful man to
persuade the common Javans that he possesses supernatural
power. At the present day this pretension, and the artifices
by which it is supported, are more generally of a religious
nature, but during the wars, every fortunate chief was considered
as partially vested with it.</p>

<p>The general term for a soldier is <em>prajúrit</em>: the guards of
the sovereign are distinguished by the term <em>tantómo</em>. <em>Sara
g'ni</em> is the name given to those who carry fire-arms. <em>Gándek</em>
are the couriers or messengers who convey the orders of the
commanders. In every army there is a certain number called
<em>jága béla</em>, whose duty it is to prevent the body of the troops
from deserting, and to see that every man does his duty. <em>Pána
káwan</em> is the term by which the youths who accompany their
fathers and relations to battle are distinguished. <em>Semút gátat</em>
is the general term for attendants, retainers, and followers of
an army. But besides distinctions of office, there are others
purely of merit and honour: those are called <em>niútra</em> who are
selected as superior to their comrades in person and strength:
the <em>prawireng</em> are those who have once distinguished themselves
in battle: <em>magátísh</em>, those who sacrifice all other prospects
in life in order to pursue the love of arms: <em>trúna-láyang</em>,
gallant youths: <em>jága súra</em>, those whose courage is undisputed,
and who keep a good look out: <em>júdi páti</em>, those who hazard
their lives in battle, as they would hazard a die in any common
game of chance; literally, who play with death: <em>nirbáya</em>,
those who are above a sense of pain or fear: <em>jáyeng
sekár</em>, flowers of victory<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. This latter term was chosen by
Marshal Daendels for the native militia raised for the service
of the Dutch government during his administration.</p>

<p>In the Dutch armies the Javans were considered as inferior
to the other islanders as soldiers, and from the facilities offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Vol I Pg 334]</a></span>
for desertion while serving on Java, it was with great difficulty
that they could be disciplined. The men were invariably
raised by conscription, and instances have occurred of their
deserting by companies. Under the British a corps of about
twelve hundred men was raised, with little prospect of advantage
for the first two years; but, by the perseverance and
ability of the officer who commanded them, they afterwards
became a well-disciplined corps, and on all occasions behaved
themselves with fidelity and courage when called into action.
As individuals, they are, for the most part, physically weaker
than the <em>Maláyus</em> and other islanders; and as a nation, their
agricultural habits have considerably obliterated the military
character which they once possessed. Their country, however,
particularly in the interior, is naturally very strong, full
of ravines and fastnesses, and their mode of warfare is perhaps
the best adapted for its defence. Were the whole
energies of the nation united under one chief, with the experience
which they now have of European tactics, it may be
assumed that they would render it impregnable to any open
attack, either of an European or an Asiatic force; but, unfortunately
for their independence, it has been their lot, as their
history will shew, to be continually disunited, either by religious
or political feuds. Their greatest resistance appears
to have been made against European influence. They maintain
with pride, that although virtually conquered, they still,
as a nation and as individuals, pertinaciously adhere to their
ancient institutions, and have a national feeling, very different
from that which is usually to be found among a conquered
people.</p>

<p>The subject of revenue, for the support of the various establishments
under the native government, has been so repeatedly
touched upon, and came so much into view in the
account given of Javan agriculture, that many further details
here would appear tedious and unnecessary. All public officers,
it has been often observed, from the highest chief to the
lowest menial, are remunerated by grants of land revokable at
pleasure, and all expences of the courts of justice, all police
and military services, defrayed out of the same fund. There
is no public treasury. When public works are to be executed,
or supplies are to be furnished, each village is called upon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Vol I Pg 335]</a></span>
furnish its quota of men, of provisions, &amp;c.; and on the equitable
regulation of these services and contributions depends
the reputation of the native chief. The land constitutes the
only treasury of the prince, and this is valuable according to
its fertility, and the extent and number of its cultivators.
There are, to be sure, certain general taxes and imposts levied
throughout the country: but these appear to have been of
comparatively modern introduction, and unconnected with the
genuine principles of the Javan government. The nature of
several of these imposts and taxes has been explained in treating
of the landed tenure and the condition of the peasantry.
The following statement, extracted from the Report of a Dutch
commissioner<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, appointed to inquire into the subject of taxation
in the year 1812, though it refers to the particular province
of <em>Surabáya</em>, may be considered as applicable to the
greater part of the island; and I here produce it in preference
to any more general or more concise account of my own, because
it will shew that the opinions I have so often expressed,
concerning the oppressions of the Dutch authorities, the patient
submission, the industry, and other good qualities of the
lower classes of Java, are not peculiar to the English, but entertained
by some of the subjects of a government which profited
by the abuses complained of, and must have been anxious
to conceal their enormity.</p>

<p>"The ordinary taxes annually levied in the district of <em>Surabáya</em>
are as follow:</p>

<p>"1. The <em>grabág</em> or <em>peték</em>, or as it is sometimes called, the
<em>chácha</em> or capitation tax, is generally levied at the rate of
four rupees for each <em>chácha</em> a year; that is to say, for such
a quantity of profitable land as may be cultivated by one
family.</p>

<p>"2. The contingent or contribution of rice to government,
being from fifteen to nineteen <em>píkúls</em> of clean rice from each
<em>jung</em>, according to its situation and fertility.</p>

<p>"3. <em>Pári pánajúng</em> (from which, however, are excused
the distant districts), consisting generally of three <em>ámats</em> of
<em>pári</em>, equal to from eight to ten <em>káti</em> of rice, from each <em>jung</em>.
This is destined for the maintenance of those <em>Mántris</em> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Vol I Pg 336]</a></span>
chiefs who were not at all or insufficiently provided with
rice fields of their own.</p>

<p>"4. <em>Pári págondíkan</em>, levied only in the districts near the
capital, consisting generally of two <em>gédings</em> or double heaps
of <em>pari</em>. This was destined for the extraordinary expences
of the districts; as the maintenance of the government, state
prisoners, native ambassadors from the opposite coast, and
the like.</p>

<p>"5. <em>Pàri pakásak</em>, consisted of three <em>gédings</em> from each
<em>jung</em>, destined for the maintenance of those who superintend
the direction of the water-courses, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"6. <em>Pári zákat</em>, consisted of one <em>ámat</em> of <em>pári</em> from each
<em>jung</em>, and was destined for the maintenance of the church
and chief priests.</p>

<p>"7. <em>Pítrah</em>, consisted in the payment of twenty <em>káti</em> of rice
from each <em>jung</em>, also destined for the maintenance of the
priests.</p>

<p>"8. <em>Máláman.</em> This consisted of a payment made to the
Regent or chiefs of the districts, at each of the three festivals
of <em>Múlut</em>, <em>Púasa</em>, and <em>Besár</em>, of ten <em>káti</em> of rice, and three
and a quarter stivers in money from each <em>jung</em>, one large
fowl, five eggs, four cocoa-nuts, one bunch of plantains:
and from those who held three or four <em>jungs</em>, was further
required a bottle of oil, to add to the solemnity of the ceremony,
to which persons of this condition were universally
invited.</p>

<p>"It is easy to conceive, that the common Javan was not
able to make any money after paying these taxes and contributions,
at least not so much as he wanted for himself and
family; particularly if we take into consideration, that it is
very seldom one man is the sole proprietor of a <em>jung</em> alone,
but that it is often divided between three and four persons,
and that, with the most successful harvest, such a <em>jung</em>
does not produce more than thirty to thirty-five <em>ámats</em> of
<em>pári</em>. With all this, however, the common Javan would
feel himself satisfied, if he had no other taxes to pay, having
generally a good many fruit trees, and a little cottage farm,
in which he cultivates <em>síri</em>, &amp;c. and sometimes a small fish-pond
in the vicinity of his dwelling, which is usually free
of tax. But this is not the case; he must submit to other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Vol I Pg 337]</a></span>
oppressions, which not being regulated, are for that reason
the heavier, because they are called for in an arbitrary way,
and because self-interest does not fail to seize every possible
opportunity of extortion.</p>

<p>"When a chief has occasion to travel, when a marriage,
birth, circumcision, recovery from illness, or any such subject
of festivity, occurs in his family, it is advertized immediately
to the subordinate towns and villages, the inhabitants
of which feel themselves obliged, each in proportion to
his means, to carry him fruits, rice, fowls, and even buffaloes
and money. These are called free presents, but in fact, are
as much an obligatory contribution as any of the others; to
say nothing of the many demands for fowls, eggs, ducks,
fruits, &amp;c. for which payment is made, but always at a rate
far below their value: or of the numerous fines which are
continually exacted from the people, in compensation, or as
hush money for disputes and offences of every description;
the taking away of <em>bámbus</em>, and sometimes of fruit trees,
when wood is required, either for government or the chief;
to which must yet be added, that for the execution of the
duties of government, and on the conveyance of orders,
<em>Mántris</em>, and other subordinate chiefs, were continually, in
the neighbourhood of the villages, just like so many voracious
birds, who think themselves entitled not only to take
something for their trouble, but to be provided during their
stay with every thing gratis, even opium, if they require it.
This custom, adopted on Java, extends to every other chief,
although not in employment, and even to the Regents, their
relations, &amp;c. None of these persons will pass through a
town or village, without demanding what he wants for his
maintenance or journey; and very often he asks what he
does not want, to the great oppression of the common Javan.
Much is wasted by this practice, and no particular advantage
appears to result from it.</p>

<p>"We must, indeed, be astonished to see all the oppressions,
&amp;c. to which the common Javan must submit. It
is usually said, indeed, that the Javan is not accustomed
to an easy life, and ought not to have more than barely
enough to keep him alive, with many more such expressions;
but this is not the manner of reasoning of any <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Vol I Pg 338]</a></span>well-thinking
man, who, though he sees very well the imperfections
and weak nature of the Javan, yet bears in mind that
he is a man like himself; who, although he has been conquered,
it is true, by the greater valour and knowledge of
the European, has still an equal right to be treated like
a man.</p>

<p>"But, alas! these are not all the vexations and oppressions
which fall to the lot of the common people, who bear all
without murmuring. The feudal service was as grievous as
almost all the other charges united. The origin of those
services must be sought for in the feudal system of the native
government, long ago adopted throughout Java. It was
considered that all the land was the property of the prince,
who only made provisional assignments thereof to his subjects,
in remuneration for military and other services rendered.
This was the cause of all the lands being divided
into as many allotments as could be cultivated, called
<em>cháchas</em>, each of a size to be cultivated by one man. A certain
number of these was assigned to the different chiefs,
according to their rank; the custom of the country fixing not
only the amount of contributions to be paid from the produce,
but the number of men to be constantly kept in
attendance upon them. The lands thus assigned to chiefs
were exempt from service to them, and the inhabitants
were only expected to watch the villages, to make and repair
the roads, and to perform other general services of the
state. This was the situation of the people with regard to
service, when the coast districts were first ceded to the
European government. The system of trade and fixed contributions
did not admit of any change, and the services
were at that time of very little consequence, and such as
could be performed without oppression to the inhabitants;
but the case is now quite different. Successively and particularly
of late years, much heavier services have been demanded
than were ever before known, and it naturally
follows, that the Javan must be kept more at work than
before. Besides, it is not possible to apportion those services
equally, on account of the situation of the places
where the services are required, and because the chiefs, who
have the direction of the works, from indifference and lazi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Vol I Pg 339]</a></span>ness,
generally make a requisition on the nearest village;
and it not unfrequently happens, that many people are thus
taken for the public service, who have no lands whatever
allotted to them.</p>

<p>"Were the requisitions made for the public service alone,
it would still be comparatively nothing, it being admitted
that the state has a right to the labour of its subjects; but
the Regents, their relations, their <em>Pátehs</em>, and the subordinate
chiefs of every description, assume the right of disposing
of the services of the common people as they think
proper, and themselves employ many of them in menial
labour of all descriptions<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, from which it arises, that the
number of people employed away from their homes, on what
is called public services, is almost incredible.</p>

<p>"It is therefore more than time, and highly necessary, that
an end be put to this monstrous system of government.
Humanity looks forward with pleasure to this step. Government,
who are essentially interested, have the most perfect
right to take it; but the change must be entire and radical.
Where the machine is entirely bad, it would be vain to
attempt the repair of a few of the parts of which it is composed:
the whole would still remain worthless, and it would
only result that the main defects being hidden by a specious
covering, the whole labour would be worse than thrown
away."</p>

<p>The British government did accordingly alter the whole
system of revenue. The subject was forced upon its attention,
not only by the desire which every humane and liberal
administration must feel, to promote the happiness of its
subjects, but by considerations of a prudential nature. The
resources of the country had sunk under a capricious and
tyrannical system of exaction; industry was paralyzed, and
confidence was destroyed. The opportunity for effecting a
reformation was favourable, our means ample, and we had
nothing to dread from the opposition of those interested in
supporting abuses: it was, therefore, resolved to abolish all
oppressive taxes, and to come immediately upon the soil for
support of our establishments, by appropriating a fixed portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Vol I Pg 340]</a></span>
of its produce, leaving the full enjoyment of the remainder to
the cultivator, with every facility for turning his industry to
account. What was done in consequence, by the land revenue
arrangements, has been seen in the account given of
landed tenure.</p>

<p>The subjects of the colony were freed from the sway of their
chiefs, who were no longer permitted to demand at pleasure
their services or their property. These chiefs were compensated
for the loss of their former influence by salaries in money
or allotments of land, which they either held on condition of
performing the police duties, or collecting the revenue. When
paid by the rent of land, they were permitted to exact no
more than the assessment settled by government. No arbitrary
power was allowed them to disturb the peasant in the
enjoyment of the remainder, or to drag him from his home
and his duties to his family, for the purpose of swelling their
idle pomp, or performing services about their person or household.
The Chinese farmers of the revenue in <em>Chéribon</em> and
other districts, having oppressed the people by every rapacious
and tyrannical expedient, were, by the discontinuance
of the farms, deprived of the power they had exercised over
the persons and property of the natives. Forced services and
all deliveries of produce at inadequate rates on government
account were abolished; and for whatever colonial produce
or supplies might be required for the public service, the fair
market price was ordered to be paid. Duties on the transport
of goods from one part of the country to another, and on the
sale of commodities at markets or bazars, were, for the most
part, abolished, as injurious to trade and discouraging to
agricultural industry. The system of farming the import and
export duties, which existed under the Dutch, was likewise
annulled, and collectors were appointed to receive the duties
immediately for government. Internal duties, of the nature
of tolls and market dues, had been universally, though secretly,
levied by the Chinese, in <em>Chéribon</em> and other places, in direct
opposition to the orders of government and the terms of their
engagement. This abuse, engrafted on the farming system,
incalculably aggravated its evils and called loudly for redress.
The farmer thrust his rapacious hand into every place where
there was the least prospect of gain, and limited his demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Vol I Pg 341]</a></span>
only by the capacity of the merchant to satisfy it, or by an ill-defined
custom, which might be perverted almost at pleasure,
so as to accommodate itself to any exaction. The evils resulting
from this mode of raising a revenue may easily be
calculated, when it is stated, that, for a very trifling contribution
to government by the farmer, duties were levied upon
internal transport amounting to nearly fifty per cent. on the
value of the commodities transported. Rice, on its transport
from one part of the island to another, had been liable to
duties of about forty-six per cent. Regulations were made
for fixing the amount of import duties, and equalizing them
over the island.</p>

<p>The restoration of the Dutch Indian empire to the sovereign
of the Netherlands, at a period when these important changes
were only in progress, may have perhaps prevented the full
accomplishment by the English of the details in some districts,
but the principles of the new system were not only
introduced and thoroughly understood in all the more populous
districts under the European government, but an experience
of three years fully demonstrated the advantages resulting
from it to the public revenue. It would have been
attended with great immediate loss, without any corresponding
future gain, to have abolished at once all the former
sources of revenue; but the thorough change of system was
declared, and the principles of it were acted upon, as far as
was consistent with the security of public tranquillity and
the realization of the current resources of the country; and
the results of these arrangements, as far as they went, proved
that a land rent might, even with the existing taxes in the
capitals, &amp;c. be realized at the rate of at least six rupees
annually from each cultivator, or after the abolition of the
taxes bearing on agriculture, at the average rate of four Spanish
dollars from each cultivator, giving in the one case a
rental for the whole island of about six millions of rupees,
and in the other of four millions of Spanish dollars, or at five
shillings the dollar, a million sterling. Of this one-fourth
would accrue to the native princes, and the remainder to the
European government. The particulars of the land revenue
settlement effected in each district, and the detailed resources
of the different parts of the island, will be particularly noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Vol I Pg 342]</a></span>
in the statistical accounts which will appear in a subsequent
part of this volume, when the subject of revenue will be again
adverted to; and, in the mean time, it may be sufficient, for
the purpose of shewing the general resources, to refer to the
annexed table, exhibiting the revenues and expenses of the
Javan government for a period of three favourable years under
the old Dutch Company, for three years under the administration
of Marshal Daendels, when its real resources were first
called forth and the revenue was higher than before known,
and for the first three years under the British government, of
which alone, the accounts are yet closed. The dependencies
included in this table do not include the Moluccas or Spice
Islands, the administration of which under the British government
was kept distinct from that of Java.</p>

<p>By this statement it will appear, that the revenues actually
realized in cash, on Java, in the year 1814-15, and before the
land revenue arrangements had become fully effectual, amounted
to upwards of six millions and a half of rupees: to this may
be added one-third more for the revenue of the native provinces,
making a total revenue of the island exceeding eight
millions and a half of rupees, or above a million sterling.</p>

<p>From a colony which was able to furnish at such a moment
so extensive a revenue from its own internal resources, after
the drains, checks, and restrictions to which it had been subjected
during the last two centuries, what might not have been
expected, had confidence been once established in the permanency
of the government, and the tide of British capital
been once fairly turned into it?</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> The inhabitants of these Islands are strikingly alive to a sense of
shame; a feeling, which is heightened by the influence of a tradition
among the Maláyus, that, on the first establishment of the Malayan nation,
the islanders stipulated, that neither they nor their descendants should
ever be put to shame. The tradition runs as follows:
</p>
<p>
"Then <em>Ampu</em> and <em>Maling</em> made obeisance to <em>Sangsapurba</em> (a prince
who had arrived in Sumatra from Western India, and who is supposed
to have founded the Malayan empire) and represented to him that <em>Demang
Lebar Daon</em> (chieftain broad leaf of Palembang), had a daughter.
<em>Sangsapurba</em> accordingly sent to ask her in marriage; but he excused
himself, alleging, that she would probably be struck with sickness, and
that he would only resign her to him as a wife on certain conditions.
These conditions were, that, on <em>Sangsapurba</em> marrying his daughter, all
the family of <em>Demang Lebar Daon</em> should submit themselves to him;
but that <em>Sangsapurba</em> should engage, both for himself and his posterity,
that they should receive a liberal treatment; and, in particular, that
when they committed a fault, they should never be exposed to shame
nor opprobrious language, but if their fault was great, that they should
be put to death according to the law. <em>Sangsapurba</em> agreed to these conditions;
but he requested, in his turn, that the descendants of <em>Demang
Lebar Daon</em> should never move any treasonable practices against his
descendants, even though they should become tyrannical. 'Very well,'
said <em>Demang Lebar Daon</em>; 'but if your descendants break your agreements,
probably mine will do the same.' These conditions were mutually
agreed to, and the parties swore to perform them, imprecating the
divine vengeance to turn their authority upside down who should infringe
these agreement. From this condition it is, that none of the
Malayan rajas ever expose their Malayan subjects to disgrace or shame:
they never bind them, nor hang them, nor give them opprobrious
language; and whenever a raja exposes his subjects to disgrace, it is the
certain token of the destruction of his country. Hence also it is, that
none of the Malayan race ever engage in rebellion, or turn their faces
from their own rajahs, even though their conduct be bad, and their proceedings
tyrannical."​&mdash;<em>Malàyan Annals.</em></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> With whatever fidelity this character of the Javan regents may have
been drawn by Mr. Hogendorp, in the year 1800, it most certainly did not
apply to them in the year 1811, nor in the subsequent years of the British
government on Java; for, however negligent and corrupt many of them
may have been rendered, by the system of government which prevailed
under the Dutch East India Company, the changes effected during the
administration of Marshal Daendals soon induced a character for energy
and activity. His government was military and despotic in the extreme,
and the regents were considered to hold a military rank, and required to
exert themselves in proportion to its importance. They did so, and works
of the greatest magnitude were constructed by their exertions. The chiefs
were found active and intelligent, the common people willing and obedient.
With regard to their character under the British Government, it would be
an act of injustice, if not ingratitude, were I to neglect this opportunity
of stating, that, as public officers, the Regents of Java were almost universally
distinguished by an anxiety to act in conformity with the wishes
of the government, by honesty, correctness, and good faith; and as noblemen,
by gentlemanly manners, good breeding, cheerfulness, and hospitality.
In the observations made upon the Javan character in the text, I have
spoken of the Javans as a nation generally; but I might select instances
where the character of the individual would rise very far above the general
standard which I have assumed. I might, for instance, notice the intellectual
endowments and moral character of the present <em>Panambáhan</em> of <em>Súmenup,
Náta Kasúma</em>. This chief is well read, not only in the ancient history
of his own country, but has a general knowledge of Arabic literature, is
conversant with the Arabic treatises on astronomy, and is well acquainted
with geography. He is curious in mechanics, attentive to the powers of
mechanism, and possesses a fund of knowledge which has surprised and
delighted all who have had an opportunity of conversing with him and of
appreciating his talents. Of his moral character I have given an instance,
in the manner in which he liberated his slaves. He is revered, not only for
his superior qualifications and talents, but also for the consideration and
attention he pays to the happiness and comfort of the people committed to
his charge.
</p>
<p>
Of the capacity of the Javans to improve, of their anxiety to advance in
civilization, and of the rapidity with which they receive knowledge and
instruction, an instance might be given in the case of the two sons of the
Regent of <em>Semárang, Kiái Adipáti Súra Adimangála</em>. This Regent, who,
next to the <em>Panambáhan</em> of <em>Súmenap</em>, is the first in rank as well as character,
shortly after the establishment of the British government on Java, sent his
sons to Bengal, in order that they might there receive an education superior
to what they could have had at home. They remained there for about
two years under the immediate protection and patronage of the late Earl of
Minto, and on their return not only conversed and wrote in the English
language with facility and correctness, but evinced considerable proficiency
in every branch of knowledge to which their attention has been directed.
The eldest, in particular, had made such progress in mathematics before he
quitted Calcutta, as to obtain a prize at a public examination, and had
acquired a general knowledge of the ancient and modern history of Europe,
particularly in that of Greece and Rome. He is remarked for his graceful
and polite manners, for the propriety of his conduct, and for the quickness
and correctness of his observation and judgment. As this is the first
instance that has been afforded of the capacity of the Javan character to
improve under an European education, it may enable the reader to form
some estimate of what that character was formerly in more propitious
times, and of what it may attain to hereafter under a more beneficent
government. Among all the English on Java, who have had an opportunity
of conversing with this young nobleman, there has not been one
who has hesitated to admit, that his mind, his qualifications, and conduct,
would be conspicuous among their own countrymen at the same age, and
that, as an accomplished gentleman, he was fitted for the first societies of
Europe. This young man, <em>Ráden Sáleh</em>, is now about sixteen years of
age, and when the British left Java was an assistant to his father as Regent
of <em>Semárang</em>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> The following description of the office of a <em>Jáksa</em>, and of the qualifications
requisite for fulfilling his important duties, is taken from the <em>Niti
Prája</em>, a work already referred to.
</p>
<p>
"A <em>Jáksa</em> must, in all cases, be impartial, to enable him to weigh all
causes which come before him with the same exactness as merchandize
is weighed in a scale, and nicely balance the equilibrium, nothing adding
or taking from either side.
</p>
<p>
"He must be above all bribery, either by words or money, and never
allow himself to be induced to commit an act of injustice; for were a
<em>Jáksa</em> to commit an act of this kind, the consequences could not but be
highly injurious to the country.
</p>
<p>
"He must not accept presents of any kind from the parties whose cause
comes before him, not only because he cannot expect to derive advantage
therefrom, but also because the public will hold discourse concerning
him highly injurious to his reputation.
</p>
<p>
"All causes in dispute must be decided upon by him with the least possible
delay, according to law, and not kept long in suspense, to the injury
of the parties concerned, lest he be considered like a holy man, who,
for the sake of money, sacrifices his good name.

"A <em>Jáksa</em> must inquire into every circumstance relating to the causes
brought before him, and duly investigate the evidence; after which he
must take the cause into consideration. He must not, in the least, listen
to what is false, and on all occasions must decide according to truth.
</p>
<p>
"A <em>Jáksa</em> who attends to all these points is of high repute. Of less repute
is a <em>Jáksa</em> who, in the decision of causes which come before him,
listens to the advice of others: such a one is like that kind of bird,
which in order to procure for itself the necessary food, dives under
water, without thinking of the danger to which it is exposed of losing
its life from the want of air. But entirely unfit for employment is a
<em>Jáksa</em> who is haughty in his demeanour, and at the same time low
enough to take advantage of persons who come before him: such a
one is like a bat, that in the dark steals the fruit from the trees; or like
a sportsman, who though destined to chase what is useful only, indiscriminately
destroys whatever comes in his way, whether useful or not.
In the same manner is it with a priest who every day attends at the
temple, for no other purpose but to make profit by it: or with a writer,
who knows not how to make any thing but by the prostitution of his
writings; or with the head man of a village, who imposes upon the villagers;
or a devotee, who gains his livelihood by necromancy."</p></div>

in the provinces subjected to European authority, previous to the
interference of the British government. The plaintiff went to the <em>Jáksa</em>
and made his complaint. If the case was important, the <em>Jáksa</em> took down
the deposition in writing in the presence of witnesses, summoned the accused,
and communicated the deposition to him. The latter then either
acknowledged or denied the facts, witnesses were examined, and the proceedings
of the suit laid before the Regent, who after perusal transmitted
the same to the <em>Panghúlu</em> for his advice, with which the latter complied,
referring at the same time for a sentence to some of the collections on
Mahomedan law. The Regent having compared the sentence with the law
and with equity, and finding the same correspondent with both, judgment
was pronounced by the <em>Jáksa</em>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_82_82" id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> With the exception, perhaps, of the right of election, which I have
not seen noticed in any account of Continental India, the constitution of
the Javan village has a striking resemblance to that of the Hindus,
according to the following statement in the Fifth Report of the House of
Commons on Indian Affairs. "A village, geographically considered, is a
tract of country comprising some hundreds or thousands of acres of
arable and waste lands; politically viewed, it resembles a corporation
or township. Its proper establishment of officers and servants consists
of the following descriptions: the <em>Potail</em> or head inhabitant, who has
generally the superintendance of the affairs of the village, settles the
disputes of the inhabitants, attends to the police, and performs the
duty of collecting the revenues within his village, a duty which his
personal influence and minute acquaintance with the situation and concerns
of the people render him the best qualified to discharge. The
<em>Kurnum</em>, who keeps the accounts of cultivation, and registers every
thing connected with it. The <em>Tallier</em> and <em>Totie</em>, the duty of the former
appearing to consist in a wider and more enlarged sphere of action, in
gaining information of crimes and offences, and in escorting and protecting
persons travelling from one village to another; the province of
the latter appearing to be more immediately confined to the village,
consisting among other duties in guarding the crops and assisting in
measuring them. The boundary man, who preserves the limits of the
village, or gives evidence respecting them in cases of dispute. The
superintendent of <em>tanks</em> and water-courses, distributes the water therefrom
for the purposes of agriculture. The <em>Bramin</em>, who performs the
village worship. The schoolmaster, who is seen teaching the children
in a village to read and write in the sand. The calendar <em>Bramin</em> or
astrologer, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
"These officers and servants generally constitute the establishment of
a village; but in some parts of the country it is of less extent, some
of the duties and functions above described being united in the same
person: in others it exceeds the number of individuals which have been
described.
</p>
<p>
"Under this simple form of municipal government, the inhabitants of
the country have lived from time immemorial. The boundaries of the
villages have been but seldom altered; and though the villages themselves
have been sometimes injured, and even desolated by war, famine,
and disease, the same name, the same limits, the same interests, and
even the same families, have continued for ages. The inhabitants give
themselves no trouble about the breaking up and division of kingdoms;
while the village remains entire, they care not to what power it is
transferred, or to what sovereign it devolves; its internal economy
remains unchanged. The <em>Potail</em> is still the head inhabitant, and still
acts as the petty judge and magistrate, and collector or renter of the
village."
</p>
<p>
In examining the interior of a village on Java, we find that, in common
with the Hindu usage, it possesses a constitution within itself, independent
of the supreme governing power. Here, as in Western India, it will
be found that each village possesses its <em>Petíng'gi</em> or chief; its <em>Kabayan</em>,
who is the deputy or assistant to the head of the village; its <em>Kamituah</em> or
elders, generally men who have formerly been chiefs of the village; its
<em>Múdin</em> or priest; its <em>Ulu-ulu</em> or <em>Kapala Bandang'an</em>, or superintendent of
water-courses; its <em>Jeru-tulis</em> or writer, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>Having, in the preceding Chapter, endeavoured to pourtray
the natural and moral character of the people of Java, and to
convey to the reader a general idea of the nature and principles
of the government to which they have been subjected, I
shall now proceed to detail some of the usages and customs
which prevail among them.</p>

<p>Of these the ceremonies of the court are the most obvious,
and a stranger cannot fail to be struck with the extreme
deference and respect towards their superiors, by which
the Javans are characterized. Respect for rank, for experience,
for parents and old age, have been already noticed
among the features of their character; but the excess to
which deference to rank is carried by the political institutions
of the country, deserves more particular remark, whether we
consider it as illustrative of the nature of the government and
the quiet and orderly disposition of the people, or endeavour
to trace, in the early periods of their history, the causes which
may have contributed to the existing constitution of society
among them.</p>

<p>The respect shewn to superior rank on Java is such, that no
individual, whatever his condition, can stand in the presence
of a superior; neither can he address him in the same language
in which he is spoken to. Not even the heir apparent,
or the members of the royal family, can stand in the presence
of the sovereign; and the same restriction applies to the family
of each subordinate chief. Were this mark of respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Vol I Pg 344]</a></span>
confined to the royal family alone, it might perhaps find a
parallel in other eastern countries, where it is usual for the subject
to prostrate himself before the sovereign, but in Java the
nature of the government is such, that each delegated authority
exacts the same marks of obeisance; so that, from the common
labourer upward, no one dares to stand in the presence of a
superior. Thus when a native chief moves abroad, it is usual
for all the people of inferior rank among whom he passes, to
lower their bodies to the ground till they actually sit on their
heels, and to remain in this posture until he is gone by. The
same rule is observed within doors; and instead of an assembly
rising on the entrance of a great man, as in Europe, it
sinks to the ground, and remains so during his presence.</p>

<p>This humiliating posture is called <em>dódok</em>, and may be rendered
into English by the term <em>squatting</em>. The practice is
submitted to with the utmost cheerfulness by the people: it is
considered an ancient custom, and respected accordingly. It
was, however, in a great measure discontinued in the European
provinces during the administration of the British government,
who endeavoured to raise the lower orders, as much
as was prudent, from the state of degradation to which their
chiefs, aided by the Dutch authority, had subjected them;
but it continued in force in the native provinces, in <em>Madúra</em>,
and to a certain extent in most of the districts at a distance
from the seats of European government.</p>

<p>In travelling myself through some of the native provinces,
and particularly in <em>Madúra</em>, where the forms of the native
government are particularly observed, I have often seen some
hundreds drop on my approach, the cultivator quitting his
plough, and the porter his load, on the sight of the <em>Túan
besár's</em> carriage. At the court of <em>Súra-kérta</em>, I recollect that
once, when holding a private conference with the <em>Susúnan</em> at
the residency, it became necessary for the <em>Ráden adipáti</em> to
be dispatched to the palace for the royal seat: the poor old
man was as usual squatting, and as the <em>Susúnan</em> happened to
be seated with his face towards the door, it was full ten minutes
before his minister, after repeated ineffectual attempts,
could obtain an opportunity of rising sufficiently to reach the
latch without being seen by his royal master. The mission
on which he was dispatched was urgent, and the <em>Susúnan</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Vol I Pg 345]</a></span>
himself inconvenienced by the delay; but these inconveniences
were insignificant, compared with the indecorum of
being seen out of the <em>dódok</em> posture. When it is necessary
for an inferior to move, he must still retain that position, and
walk with his hams upon his heels until he is out of his superior's
sight.</p>

<p>Besides this deference in the posture of the body, a deference,
equally striking and still more defined, is shewn in the
language used to a superior. The vernacular language of the
country is never allowed to be used on such occasions, but
only an arbitrary language, distinguished by the term <em>bása</em>,
the language, or <em>bása kráma</em>, the polite language, or language
of honour. The common people are thus not permitted to
use the same language as the great, or in other words, are by
the political institutions of the country, in a great degree, deprived
of the use of their mother tongue. This subject will
however be more particularly treated of in another chapter.
That a set of people who have received some mental culture
will necessarily discover it in their language, and that a line of
distinction will be thus drawn between the well informed and
the ignorant, is natural; and of the employment of a different
number of persons in the verbs and pronouns, according as
supremacy, respect, or familiarity is to be expressed, the modern
European languages afford abundant example: but that
one class of words should be exacted from the lower orders
as a homage to the powerful, and another class given in exchange,
serving to remind them of their inferiority, is a
refinement in arbitrary power, which it would be difficult
to parallel.</p>

<p>Having thus seen the nature and extent of the general deference
paid to a superior on Java, the reader will be prepared,
in some degree, for the still further humiliations which
are expected from a subject on public occasions. No one
approaches his sovereign or immediate chief, no child approaches
his father, without <em>súmbah</em>, (to that is, obeisance) closing
his hands and raising them to his forehead, in token of respect.
On public or festival days, it is usual for the inferior
chiefs, not as in Europe, to kiss the hand, but to kiss the
knee, the instep, or the sole of the foot, according to the relative
distance of rank between the parties.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Vol I Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>The royal seat is a large stool or bench of gold or silver
with a velvet cushion: it is called <em>dámpar</em>, and attends the
sovereign wherever he may go.</p>

<p>Among the regalia (<em>upachára</em>), which are always carried
in procession when the sovereign moves abroad, and are
arranged behind him while seated on the <em>dámpar</em>, are the
following golden figures:​&mdash;the <em>hásti</em> or <em>gája</em>, that of an elephant;
the <em>hárda walíka</em> or <em>nanágan</em>, that of a serpent; the
<em>jajáwen sánting</em>, that of a bull; the <em>sángsam</em>, that of a deer;
and the <em>sáwung gáling</em>, that of a cock fowl; each of a size
to be borne in the hand. These, with the <em>kútuk</em> and <em>chapúri</em>
for tobacco and <em>síri</em>, the <em>pakachohán</em> or golden spitting-pot,
and a variety of golden salvers, bowls, &amp;c. distinguished by
the respective names applicable to their different purposes,
have descended as <em>pusákas</em>, or heir-looms, in the royal
family, and are esteemed with the highest degree of veneration.</p>

<p>When the sovereign moves abroad, he is attended by
numerous spearmen (<em>wáhos</em>), the duty of eight of whom is
to attend the figures of the sacred elephant and bull, near
which are also led four horses richly caparisoned. The royal
<em>páyung</em>, or state umbrella, is carried in front of the procession
on these occasions, in which are also invariably
carried four trunks or boxes (<em>brókoh</em>), each borne by two
men, and containing the clothes of the sovereign, caparison
for his horses, his personal arms, implements, provisions, and
in short every thing required for an establishment: this rule
is observed whenever the sovereign moves out of the palace.
His mat (<em>lánté</em>) is likewise borne in procession, together with
two saddle horses for his use when necessary.</p>

<p>The ceremonies and state of the native courts have lost
much of their genuine character, from the admission of European
customs, introduced by the Dutch after the last Javan
war. Salutes are regulated after the European order, and the
Javans have availed themselves of many of the customs of
Europeans, to render the ceremonies of state more striking.
Thus both the <em>Susúnan</em> and <em>Súltan</em> are furnished with large
gilt carriages, after the fashion of those used by the Lord
Mayor of London. When the former drinks wine with the
governor, the rest of the company are offered white wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Vol I Pg 347]</a></span>
while they alone drink red, and a flourish of trumpets sounds
as the glass approaches their lips.</p>

<p>It may be observed, that few people are more attached to
state and show than the Javans; that, in general, the decorations
employed and the forms observed are chaste, and at
the same time imposing, calculated to impress a stranger with
a high idea of their taste, their correctness and yet love
of splendour. The ornaments of state, or regalia, are well
wrought in gold; the royal shield is richly inlaid with precious
stones, and the royal <em>krís</em> is hung in a belt, which, with
its sheath, is one blaze of diamonds. In processions, when
the European authority is to be received, each side of the
road, for miles, is lined with spearmen in different dresses,
and standing in various warlike attitudes; streamers flying,
and the music of the <em>gámelán</em> striking up on every side.
<em>Páyungs</em>, or umbrellas of three tiers, of silk richly fringed
and ornamented with gold, are placed at intervals, and nothing
is omitted which can add to the appearance of state and
pomp. Among the ensigns displayed on these occasions are
the <em>Monkey</em> flag of <em>Arjúna</em>, and a variety of other devices
taken from the poems of antiquity, as well as the double-bladed
sword, and a variety of inscriptions from the Arabs.</p>

<p>The chiefs of provinces, and the petty chiefs in their gradation
below them, keep up as much of the form and ceremony
of the chief court as is consistent with their relative rank and
means; and, in their turn, exact from their vassals the same
degree of respect which the sovereign exacts from them.</p>

<p>On occasions when the Regents are anxious to shew particular
respect to Europeans, as on the entrance of the
Governor, or other high officer travelling, it is the custom,
particularly in the <em>Súnda</em> districts, to erect triumphal arches
of <em>bámbu</em> at the entrance of the principal villages; and the
taste and variety displayed on these occasions have been
often noticed, as evincing a refinement beyond what the
general results of their present state of civilization might
justify.</p>

<p>In a former place I noticed, that the gradations of rank
among the Javans were, in some instances, marked by the
dress they wore, and by the manner of putting on the <em>krís</em>;
but a more defined line is drawn by the <em>páyung</em>, or umbrella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Vol I Pg 348]</a></span>
which is subject to the following regulation from immemorial
custom:</p>

<p>1. The Sovereign alone is entitled to the golden <em>páyung</em><a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>.</p>

<p>2. The <em>Rátu</em>, or Queen, and the members of the royal
family, to the yellow <em>páyung</em>.</p>

<p>3. The family of the <em>Rátu</em>, and the family of the Sovereign
by his concubines, to the white <em>páyung</em>.</p>

<p>4. The <em>Bopátis</em> and <em>Tumúng'gungs</em> to the green <em>páyung</em>,
edged and mounted with gold.</p>

<p>5. The <em>Ang'ebáis</em>, <em>Ráng'gas</em>, <em>Mántris</em>, &amp;c. to the red
<em>páyung</em>.</p>

<p>6. The heads of villages, and other petty officers, to the
dark <em>páyung</em>.</p>

<p>In order to convey an idea of the different titles and the
gradations of rank among the Javans, it becomes necessary,
in consequence of the confusion which has arisen among them
of late years, to revert to what they were supposed to be
in the days of <em>Májapáhit</em> and previously, when the Hindu
faith and institutions exclusively prevailed.</p>

<p>The usual term for the sovereign was then <em>Rátu</em>, and in the
literary compositions which have descended to us, he was
either distinguished by such epithets as <em>Nára-náta</em>, <em>Nára-dípa</em>,
<em>Nára-páti</em>, <em>Naríndra</em>, <em>Narária</em>, <em>Aji</em>, <em>Prábu</em>, <em>Kátong</em>,
<em>Ajung</em>, or <em>Máharája</em>. The queen was called <em>Pramiswári</em>.
The children of the sovereign were called, the princes <em>Ráden</em>,
and the princesses <em>Déwi</em>, which titles were hereditary in their
families. The brothers of the sovereign had the title of
<em>Ráden aria</em>.</p>

<p>When a sovereign was advanced in age, and quitted his
government to become a devotee, he was called <em>Begáwan</em>.</p>

<p>The minister who administered the country in the name of
the sovereign, and issued his orders to the governors of
provinces, &amp;c. was always termed <em>Páteh</em>; and the chiefs
employed in administering the government of the provinces,
or otherwise in the government of the country, were entitled
either <em>Pratíiwa</em>, <em>Pung'gáwa</em>, <em>Niáka</em>, or <em>Bopáti</em>. The chiefs
below these, and subject to their orders, such as <em>Ráng'ga</em>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Vol I Pg 349]</a></span><em>Ange'bái</em>, <em>Demáng</em>, <em>Praméa</em>, <em>Ménak</em>, <em>Klíwon</em>, and others
were included in the class of <em>Mantris</em>.</p>

<p>The heads of villages were called either <em>Umbul</em>, <em>Patíng'gi</em>,
<em>Babákal</em>, <em>Babáhu</em>, <em>Lúra</em>, or <em>Kúwu</em>.</p>

<p>The commanders-in-chief in war had the title of <em>Senapáti</em>.
The general term for soldiers was <em>prajúrit</em>; and those
employed in guarding the country from the approach of an
enemy were called either <em>Pechát tánda</em>, <em>Támping</em>, or <em>Ulu-bálang</em>.</p>

<p>In judicial affairs the <em>Jáksa</em> was the chief. His assistant
or deputy was <em>Paliwára</em>, and the officers of his court <em>Kérta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Wadána gédong</em> was the title given to the officer entrusted
with the charge of the sovereign's purse and personal property,
and with the collection of his revenues: the secretary
or writer was called <em>Chárik</em>. <em>Tánda</em> and <em>Sabándar</em> was the
title of the officers who collected the duties in the markets
and along the high roads.</p>

<p>When it was necessary for the sovereign to move from one
part of the country to another, there was always a class of
<em>Mántris</em> in attendance, to whom the title of <em>Pang'alasan</em> or
<em>Kajíneman</em> was given.</p>

<p>On the establishment of the Mahomedan religion, in the
Javan year 1400, a new gradation of rank and order of titles
was introduced by the sultan of <em>Demák</em>, as follows.</p>

<p>The sovereign, instead of being called <em>Rátu</em>, took the name
of <em>Susuhúnan</em><a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, or <em>Sultan</em>, and the queen was called <em>Rátu</em>.
The title of <em>Panámbahán</em> was conferred as the highest in
rank next to the sovereign, and above the princes of the
blood, who were now termed <em>Pang'éran</em> or <em>Pang'éran ária</em>;
the princesses born of the queen were termed <em>Rátu</em>, and the
daughters by concubines <em>Ráden áyu</em>. The sons of the
princes were called <em>Ráden mas</em>, until they were married, when
they were termed <em>Ráden</em> only; their daughters before marriage
were called <em>Ráden ajéng</em>, and after marriage <em>Ráden áyu</em>.
The <em>Susuhúnan's</em> great grandchildren by his wife were
allowed to assume the title of <em>Ráden</em>, and those by his concubines
bore the title of <em>Mas</em>, the latter title continuing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Vol I Pg 350]</a></span>descend in the family to the offspring by a wife, those by
a concubine taking the title of <em>Bágus</em>, which is considered as
the lowest title appertaining to royalty. It would be tedious,
in this place, to detail the minor titles common in the <em>Súnda</em>
districts; they will be more particularly noticed in the statistical
accounts of those districts.</p>

<p>When a <em>Bopáti</em>, or governor of a province, is appointed, he
is furnished with a <em>piágam</em> or <em>nawála</em>, or letter patent, fixing
his rank, and the extent of assignment of lands conferred
upon him<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>; also with a <em>báwat</em>, or stick, similar to that of
the <em>páyung</em>, or umbrella, measuring about eight feet long, with
which it is his duty to measure the <em>sáwah</em> or rice fields.</p>

<p>When a chief of the rank of <em>Mántri</em> is appointed, he
is furnished with a <em>krís</em> handle and with a mat, which is carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Vol I Pg 351]</a></span>
behind him when he moves about, as well for use as to
shew his rank.</p>

<p>The Javans include in the general term of <em>Priáyi</em> all
persons above the rank of common people, a term which in its
general application on Java is not very unlike that of gentlemen,
or latterly of esquires, in England.</p>

<p>Among the forms of an eastern court, few are more particularly
observed than those relating to ambassadors. The
Javans have long ceased to send or receive ambassadors,
but the following extracts from the <em>Níti Prája</em>, will shew
what they conceive ought to be the qualifications and conduct
of such an officer.</p>

<p>"A person entrusted with a message from his prince, must
never abuse the trust placed in him, but always keep in
sight that on such occasions he is the representative of the
prince. And chiefly, if he is sent with a letter from the
prince to a foreign country, in this case he must be less submissive
than before his own prince. According to circumstances
he must conduct himself with dissimulation, and
before he enters any foreign country, by some secret means
or other, occasion his own name, and that of the prince his
master, to be spread over the country, at the same time that
he obtains every possible information regarding the state of
the country and people. On entering the country, he must
assume a dignified appearance, and not speak or look about
him more than is necessary. Such conduct will inspire the
people with respect for him.</p>

<p>"The letter must be carried on the shoulder, and in his
gait and speech he must conduct himself with propriety. In
delivering the letter he must present himself with dignity,
approach first, and then retire from the person to whom the
letter is directed, speak with him at a distance, and not too
familiarly.</p>

<p>"In all cases he must be careful not to go beyond his
orders. His deportment must be unassuming yet dignified;
and having received an answer for his prince, it is his duty
to depart immediately, and to proceed with it direct to the
prince, without even going to his own house first. If the
letter is from some person lower in rank than his master, he
must not immediately shew it, but conceal it for a time; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Vol I Pg 352]</a></span>
if it is from a prince of equal rank, then must he carry the
letter before him. When a letter is from a prince to one of
his subjects, it must be carried high. Coming in the presence
of his prince, he must carefully watch his eye, that
he may deliver the letter on the first intimation given by
the prince that he is ready to receive it.</p>

<p>"Whoever dictates a letter must be careful that a letter to
a superior is not couched in the same terms as a letter to
an inferior."</p>

<p>The three most remarkable events in the history of the individual
are his birth, his marriage, and his death; to these
accordingly have the greatest number of forms and ceremonies
been attached.</p>

<p>As soon as it is observed that a Javan woman is in the third
month of pregnancy, the event is communicated to all the
nearest relations, to whom, at the same time, presents are
made, consisting of yellow rice, sweet-scented oils, and wax
candles. People of condition add some cloths, gold, silver,
or brass cups, as also needles, either of those metals or of
iron.</p>

<p>After seven months' pregnancy, a festival is given to the
relations and friends, at which yellow rice forms invariably
a part of the entertainment.</p>

<p>The pregnant woman must afterwards wash her body with
the milk of a green cocoa-nut, on the shell of which has been
previously carved two handsome figures, one of each sex, by
which the parents intend to represent a standard of beauty
for their expected offspring, and to engrave on the imagination
of the mother, impressions which may extend to the lineaments
of her infant. The nut must be opened by the husband.
She is next to bathe in water, into which many sweet-scented
flowers have been thrown, and to dress herself with a new
cloth, making a present of the old one, together with money,
raw rice, <em>sírí</em>, and cocoa-nuts, to the midwife, who assists in
her lustrations. On the night of these ceremonies there must
be a <em>wáyang</em> or scenic shadow performed, the object of which
is to represent the life and adventures of a certain prince in
the line of <em>Déwa Batára Bráma</em>.</p>

<p>If the woman is delivered of a son, the after-birth is immediately
cut off with a very sharp knife of <em>bámbu</em>, wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Vol I Pg 353]</a></span>
a piece of paper on which is written the Javan alphabet, then
laid in a new pot, and buried in the ground, at which place a
lamp, covered with a basket of <em>bámbu</em>, and adorned with
leaves of the <em>pandánri</em>, is put, and kept burning till the umbilical
cord of the child falls off. When this takes place, the
child is watched the whole night, by persons who read the
history of the <em>Déwas</em>, or of famous princes, or amuse themselves
with a <em>wáyang</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as the child is nine months old, the parents entertain
their relatives and friends with a <em>wáyang</em> and festival.</p>

<p>Marriages are invariably contracted, not by the parties
themselves, but by their parents or relations on their behalf.
Such interference (which was common among the Greeks,
without the same apology) is rendered necessary by the early
age at which the matrimonial union is formed, and the incompetence
of either of the intended couple to form a discreet and
prudent choice. During the period that intervenes between
the application of the friends of the boy to the parents or
guardians of the girl for their concurrence in the match, and
the obtainment of it, her condition is distinguished by the
term <em>tétákon</em> (enquired for): when the consent of her parents
is obtained, it is termed <em>lámar</em> (solicited). According to
ancient custom, after matters proceeded thus far, a present
of different valuables, termed <em>paníng'sat</em> is sent by the intended
bridegroom to the bride, and her acceptance of it, implying
that she concurs in the previous steps taken towards her settlement,
renders the contract binding. The general prevalence
of similar customs cannot fail to strike those who are acquainted
with the nature of the <em>sponsalia dona</em> of the Romans,
and the marriage ceremonies detailed in various passages of
Scripture (Genesis, ch. xv. 2; xxiv. 5, &amp;c.) A present of this
kind is described as being sent by <em>Pánji Kérta Páti</em> to the
Princess <em>Chándra Kirána of Dahá</em><a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>, and we are told that it
thence became a custom among the Javans.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Vol I Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>By any reluctance to complete his engagement, the bridegroom
forfeits to his betrothed these earnest gifts (as they may
be called); while, on the other hand, if the obstacles to the
completion of the marriage originate with her, she is bound
to return them. This present is also called <em>patiba sámpir</em>.</p>

<p>This custom, however, is now not so common as formerly:
it is in a great measure discontinued or confounded with the
next ceremony, termed <em>sárahan</em> (delivered up.) This consists
in making various presents to the bride a short time before the
day fixed for the marriage, after the delivery of which, the bride
and bridegroom are confined to the house, until the ceremony
takes place. The period varies; but with people of distinction
there generally elapses an interval of forty days between the
<em>sárahan</em> and the marriage.</p>

<p>On the day of the marriage (for which one that is considered
fortunate<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> is previously selected) the father of the bride
proceeds to the mosque, accompanied by the bridegroom, and
informing the <em>Panghúlu</em> that the lad whom he presents has
agreed to give the <em>sri káwin</em> (generally about two dollars),
requests him to marry him to his daughter: on which the
<em>Panghúlu</em> inquires of the bridegroom whether he has paid
the amount, or is willing to do so? and upon the affirmative
being declared, he sanctifies the marriage by words to the
following effect:</p>

<p>"I join you, <em>ráden mas</em> (bridegroom), in wedlock with
<em>sátia</em> (the bride), with a pledge of two reals weight in gold
or silver<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. You take (<em>sátia</em>) to be your wife for this world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Vol I Pg 355]</a></span>You are obliged to pay the pledge of your marriage (<em>sri
káwin</em>), or to remain debtor for the same. You are responsible
for your wife in all and every thing. If you should
happen to be absent from her for the space of seven months
on shore, or one year at sea, without giving her any subsistence,
and are remiss in the performance of the duties
which you owe to your sovereign, your marriage shall be
dissolved, if your wife requires it, without any further form
or process; and you will be, besides, subject to the punishment
which the Mahomedan law dictates."</p>

<p>Should any circumstance occur to prevent the bridegroom
from attending at the mosque on the day selected for the
marriage, he follows the singular custom of sending his <em>krís</em><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
to the ceremony, which is deemed sufficient by the <em>Panghúlu</em>;
and afterwards he may appoint a proxy to represent him in
the processions which follow. But this is seldom done when
a man marries for the first time.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, the bridegroom pays the priest the
marriage fees (<em>saláwat</em>), which ought, according to strict
Mahomedans, not to exceed fifteen stivers. In most instances,
the fees are raised to five times that sum in money, besides
in many places a fowl, a hank of cotton-yarn, four <em>kátis</em> of
rice, two cocoa-nuts, <em>síri</em>, and fruit.</p>

<p>On the wedding day, or sometimes the day following, the
bridegroom dressed in his best clothes, mounted on horseback,
accompanied by all his friends, and attended with music in
the front and rear, proceeds at noon to the dwelling of the
bride, who, on his approach, comes out to meet him at the
door. In some districts, before their nearer approach, the
bride and bridegroom throw simultaneously a bundle of <em>síri</em>
at each other with considerable force, with the intention, it is
said, of learning, from the dexterity with which the parties,
respectively perform this singular feat, and the success that
attends it, which of them will be able best to maintain their
privileges, or gain an ascendancy during the continuance of
their union. They prognosticate that, if the bundle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Vol I Pg 356]</a></span>
bridegroom touch the head of the bride, it is an infallible
sign that he must rule; otherwise, the reverse.</p>

<p>The bride, after this, receives the bridegroom with a low
obeisance, in testimony of her regard for him, extending
similar marks of respect to his parents, who attend him. The
married couple are then placed in a situation elevated above
the rest of the company; and in token of their afterwards
living together, and sharing the same sustenance, commence
eating <em>síri</em> from the same <em>síri</em>-box.</p>

<p>In some districts, after leaving the mosque, the bridegroom
and his father proceed to the house of the bride's parents,
where they obtain her company in a procession through the
village or town. On these occasions, the bride is carried on
a litter, which is generally fashioned in the form of a <em>garúda</em>,
and the bridegroom is mounted on horseback. All the relations
and friends of the parties attend, carrying flowers and
refreshments, together with the presents made to the bridegroom
on his marriage. The procession moves on to the
sound of the national music, and the occasional firing of
cannon. A feast is given in the evening at the house of the
bride's parents, at which the new married couple remain for
the night. The term given to the bride and bridegroom is
<em>peng'ánten</em>, and the marriage ceremony is called <em>láki rábi</em>.</p>

<p>On the next day in some districts, and on the fifth in
others, the bridegroom (or <em>peng'ánten lánang</em>), and bride
(<em>peng'anten wádon</em>), together with the whole train of relations
and friends, visit in like manner the house of the bridegroom's
father. This ceremony is called <em>únduh mántu</em> (accepting
the daughter-in-law.) There they both again sit down to eat
<em>síri</em> in some place of distinction; similar entertainments are
repeated, and on the following day they return with the same
pomp and form to the bride's dwelling, the ceremony being
now completed.</p>

<p>With the exception of the delivery of the <em>sri káwin</em>, and
the procession to the mosque, there is very little in these
ceremonies conformable to the Mahomedan precepts.</p>

<p>Marriages are frequently contracted between children, and
then termed <em>gántung káwin</em> (hanging-on marriages); but in
this case the parties are kept separate, and the principal
ceremonies are reserved till they attain the age of puberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Vol I Pg 357]</a></span>
Such contracts proceed from a laudable solicitude, on the
part of parents, to provide a suitable and advantageous
match for their children as early as possible; and to the
same cause, as much, perhaps, as from the influence of
climate and intemperance of manners, may be attributed the
early age, at which matrimonial engagements are sometimes
consummated.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the reasons for such early marriages,
one of the most serious consequences is the facility with
which they are dissolved. The multiplication of divorces is
mentioned by the poets, the moralists, and the historians of
the Roman empire, as one of the greatest causes and symptoms
of the corruption and degeneracy of the period in which
they lived; and certainly it had proceeded to great lengths,
when Seneca could say that a woman computed her age, not
by the annual succession of consuls, but of husbands<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. The
Javans, though a simple people, are in this respect too like
the profligate and dissolute Romans.</p>

<p>In no part of the world are divorces more frequent than on
Java; for besides the facilities afforded by the Mahomedan
ordinances, a woman may at any time, when dissatisfied with
her husband, demand a dissolution of the marriage contract,
by paying him a sum established by custom, according to the
rank of the parties: about twenty dollars for a person of the
lower orders, and fifty dollars for those of the degree of
<em>Demáng</em> or <em>Mántri</em>. The husband is not bound to accept it;
but he is generally induced to do so, from a consideration,
that the opinions and custom of the country require it; that
his domestic happiness would be sacrificed in a contest with
his reluctant companion; and that, by continuing his attachment,
he would incur the shame of supporting one who
treated him with aversion or contempt. This kind of divorce
is termed <em>mánchal</em>. The husband may at any time divorce
his wife, on making a settlement upon her sufficient to support
her according to her condition in life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Vol I Pg 358]</a></span></p>
<p>A widow may marry again at the expiration of three months
and ten days after her husband's death.</p>

<p>When a person of rank or property dies, all his relations,
male and female, meet at the house of the deceased, to testify
their grief at the death and their respect for the memory of
the departed. On that occasion, what is termed <em>selámat</em>
money is distributed among all according to circumstances.
The priests, who are to perform the service at the place of
interment, receive a Spanish dollar, a piece of cloth, and a
small mat each.</p>

<p>When the corpse is washed<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and wrapped in a white cloth,
it is carried out of the house on a bier covered with coloured
chintz, on which garlands of flowers are hung as drapery.
On this occasion, no means of costly pomp or impressive
solemnity are neglected in the use of umbrellas (<em>páyung</em>),
pikes, and other insignia of honour. All the relations and
friends accompany the corpse to the grave, where the priest
addresses a prayer to heaven and delivers an exhortation to
the soul of the deceased; of which the substance commonly
is, "that it should be conscious of being the work of the
Creator of the universe, and after leaving its earthly
dwelling, should speed its way to the source whence it
issued." After this ceremony the corpse is interred, and
the other priests continue their prayers and benedictions.</p>

<p>For seven successive nights, the same priests meet and
pray at the house of the deceased, in the presence of his
relations.</p>

<p>On the third, seventh, fourteenth, hundredth, and thousandth
day or night after the death of a person, are observed
particular festivals or solemn feasts in his commemoration, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Vol I Pg 359]</a></span>
which occasions prayers are offered up for the happiness of
his soul.</p>

<p>The body is interred after the usual manner of the Mahomedans,
and a <em>sambója</em> tree is usually planted by its side.
It is the universal practice of the relatives of the deceased to
strew the graves several times in the year with the sweet-scented
flowers of the <em>sulási</em> (the <em>tulsi</em> of Bengal), which are
raised exclusively for this purpose. The burial-grounds are,
in general, well chosen. In <em>Kedú</em>, where the most beautiful
eminences have been selected for this purpose, and where the
<em>cambôja</em> tree grows with the greatest luxuriance, they form
very interesting objects in the landscape. The burial-places
of the royal family and of the nobles of the country are
usually called <em>astána</em>; they are surrounded by one or more
high walls, and in general by stately <em>waríng'en</em> trees. The
tombs are sometimes ornamented with sculptural devices and
well-executed inscriptions, either in the Javan or Arabic
character. They are kept clean and repaired by contributions
from all parts of the country, under the superintendence of
priests appointed to that particular duty, and are respected
and guarded with religious veneration and zeal. The burial-place
of the family now on the throne is at <em>Megíri</em>, in the
province of <em>Matárem</em>, a few miles distant from the modern
capital of <em>Yúgya-kérta</em>.</p>

<p>As the Javans are still devotedly attached to their ancient
customs and ceremonies (few of which they have sacrificed to
their new faith), I shall, in order to give a better idea of those
still observed on the most remarkable occasions, present a
short account of their state anterior to the introduction of
Mahomedanism, as far as it can be ascertained. Though, as
Mahomedans, they are averse to an open avowal of Pagan
practices, they still preserve them more or less, according as
the parties happen to be less or more under the influence of
Arab priests.</p>

<p>When a woman was pregnant with her first child, at the
expiration of four months a feast was given, at which yellow
rice was served up. This entertainment was insignificant
compared with that which was observed at the expiration of
seven months, when the guests were presented with cloth,
gold, silver, and steel, according to the means of the parties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Vol I Pg 360]</a></span>
a piece of steel never failing to be one of the gifts, though it
did not exceed the size of a needle. On this occasion a new
bath was prepared in the evening, and watched during the
night by the light of a lamp. At the side of the bath were
laid two stalks of the dark coloured sugar cane, as an offering
to <em>Batára Kála</em>, a painted cloth of the pattern <em>túwuh wátu</em>,
and a young cocoa-nut (<em>chénkir gáding</em>), on which was engraved
the resemblance of <em>Pánji Kérta Páti</em> and his wife
<em>Chándra Kirána</em> of <em>Dáha</em>. In the morning the wife, after
putting on the cloth, entered the bath, when the water from
the young cocoa-nut was poured over her: during the day
it was also incumbent on her to change her dress seven times.
At the feast given on this occasion, fish, flesh, and fowl were
invariably served up, and performances of the <em>wáyang</em> were
exhibited.</p>

<p>Immediately on the birth of the child it was placed in a
kind of basket made of <em>bámbu</em> (in form similar to the sieve or
farming basket used for separating the chaff from the rice),
the relations were assembled, and the remains of the umbilical
cord were carefully cut off by means of a piece of sharpened
<em>bámbu</em>. The part abstracted by this operation was deposited
in the interior of a cocoa-nut, with a lump of turmerick placed
under it. This cocoa-nut was ornamented on the outside with
the twenty letters of the Javan alphabet. It was afterwards
put into an earthen pot, and either buried under ground or
thrown into the sea. A stone rolling-pin, dressed up like a
baby, was placed in the basket in its stead. The female relations
relieved each other through the day and night, in constantly
supporting the child in their arms, till the navel was
healed; the male relations all the while reading and reciting
the history of <em>Ráma</em>, and other mythological and historical
romances. As soon as the child was recovered, a grand feast
was observed, with performances of the <em>wáyang</em>. Near the
<em>Dálang</em> (director of the <em>wáyang</em>) was placed a bowl of pure
water, into which fresh and sweet-scented flowers were cast,
two black sugar-canes, a cloth of the <em>túwuh wátu</em> pattern,
and a piece of white cloth, together with a bundle of <em>pári</em> and
different kinds of eatables. On this occasion was exhibited
the drama of <em>Batára Dúrga</em> and <em>Sang Yang Jágat Náta</em> (one
of the designations of <em>Gúru</em>), at that passage where, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Vol I Pg 361]</a></span>
the first two quarters of the moon, the former appeared in her
amiable character of <em>Uma</em><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, and where, in the city of <em>Kúru
Sétra Gándamáyu</em>, she is delivered of a son, <em>Batára Kála</em>,
having the form of a <em>Rasáksa</em>, "greedy to destroy and devour
mankind." At that part of the performance when <em>Sang Yang
Jágat Náta</em> takes the child on his lap, the <em>Dálang</em> did the
same with the infant, repeating the invocation, <em>"hong! ila-heng!"</em>
several times, and afterwards returning it into the
hands of the father. On this occasion the <em>wáyang</em> was performed
from seven o'clock in the evening till eight o'clock in
the morning.</p>

<p>When the child was forty days old, its head was shaved,
as directed by the parent, and the ceremony took place of
giving it whatever name should be determined on by the
father and the elders.</p>

<p>The <em>Dúkun</em> (midwife) who attended at the delivery, was
entitled to receive for her trouble fourteen <em>wang</em> (about a
rupee) if it was an ordinary birth, but in difficult cases her
allowance was proportionately increased. Her attendance
continued for the mornings and evening of forty days, at the
expiration of which she was further entitled to receive a present
of two pieces of cloth, one small and one large, four <em>kátis</em>
of rice, two cocoa-nuts, and some <em>síri</em>. If required to attend
beyond that period, she was paid accordingly. A <em>Dúkun</em> once
employed, could not be exchanged on any account during the
forty days. Women invariably acted as midwives; in other
cases the medical art was practised exclusively by the men.</p>

<p>On the child's attaining its seventh month, a feast was given,
when it was for the first time placed with its feet on the ground.
At this entertainment rice cakes and sweetmeats of different
colours and kinds were served up; and if it happened that the
child had come into the world either as the sun was just rising
or setting, a bundle of grass or rubbish was thrown into the
basket, upon the top of which it was placed for a few minutes;
after which one of the elders taking the child into his arms
repeated the following words: "<em>Hong! 'amilam mastúna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Vol I Pg 362]</a></span>masidam! súming'gáha yéwang Kala'ing w'ru ajal amúla-níra
ana-níra, Sang-yang Sába lan Batári Dúrga</em>:" which
after an invocation to the Deity would express, "Begone,
oh God <em>Kála</em>, for I am not ignorant of thy nature, nor of
thy being descended from <em>Sang Yang Sába (Gúru)</em> and
<em>Batára Dúrga</em><a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>."</p>

<p>When the child attained the age of one year, another feast
was given in commemoration of its nativity, and this universally
among all classes of people; those who possessed the
means kept the anniversary of their birth-day until their death.</p>

<p>Marriages were invariably contracted by the relations of
the parties, by the paternal grandfather or grandmother if
living, if not by the parents, and in case of their demise, by
the natural guardian. Thus the brother, on the death of his
parents, was permitted to dispose of the hand of his sister;
and a deviation from this course was deprecated, as laying a
foundation for quarrels and dissensions.</p>

<p>The consent of the relations being obtained, the bridegroom
was bound to serve the parents of the bride for a year<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>.</p>

<p>For forty days previous to the celebration of the marriage,
the parties were not allowed to go to a distance from their
homes, or to be employed in any severe labour.</p>

<p>At sunset on the wedding day, the bridegroom went in procession
to visit the parents of the bride, after which she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Vol I Pg 363]</a></span>visited by his parents, who on these occasions gave the married
couple their blessing, wishing them happiness as lasting
as that enjoyed by the god <em>Kámajáya</em> with his consort <em>Kámaráti</em>.</p>

<p>One of the elders, or an <em>Ajar</em>, then repeated the following
benediction:</p>

<p><em>"Hong! Gáng'ga-trigáng'ga? pináyung hana kala chákra
kinásih hána pra-dewáta hipáta'ing sapudénda tulúsa
amándan waríng'en."</em> "Hail! holy water, thrice holy
water! be it as a covering to shield you from harm: may
the gods be merciful unto you: henceforth be nourishing as
the <em>pándan</em> and <em>waríng'en</em> trees."</p>

<p>In these processions the bridegroom was obliged to prepare
whatever ornaments, trinkets, or gifts, the mother of the bride
had fixed her fancy upon, either at the birth of her daughter
or on any other occasion, whether they consisted in the representation
of a white elephant, a white tiger, or the like.</p>

<p>Five days after the consecration of the marriage, the parents
of the bride, with whom she staid for that period, prepared a
feast, at which was invariably served up among other things
yellow rice. This entertainment was given to mark the period
of the consummation: and after celebrating such an event,
it was thought proper that the bride should be on a visit to
the parents of her husband, remain under their roof, share
their protection, and subsist at their expense for forty days
without going abroad, at the expiration of which the new
married couple were at liberty to go to their own house and
pursue their own plans of life, becoming liable to contribute
their share to the revenues and demands of the state.</p>

<p>The dresses worn on the nuptial day are thus described in
the romance of <em>Pánji</em>.</p>

<p>"It being arranged that at the same time when <em>Rádin Pánji</em>
was to receive the princess <em>Déwi Chándra Kirána</em> in marriage,
<em>Rétna Jinóli</em>, his sister, should also be married to
<em>Gúnung Sári</em>, son of the Prince of <em>Dáha</em>, the Prince of
<em>Dáha</em> departed with a joyful heart, and gave the necessary
directions to prepare the clothing and ornaments necessary
for the two brides.</p>

<p>"<em>Klána Jáyang Sári</em><a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>, accompanied by his sister, <em>Rétna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Vol I Pg 364]</a></span>Jinóli</em>, and his numerous followers then entered the <em>dálam</em>
of the prince. <em>Klána Jáyang Sâri</em> wore on the occasion a
<em>dódot</em> of silk stamped with flowers of gold; his <em>chelána</em>
were of the green <em>chindi</em> ornamented with golden lace round
the bottom, and studded with <em>kúnang-kúnang</em> (golden ornaments
made to represent the fire-fly); his <em>sumping</em> (ornaments
at the back of the ear) were of golden flowers studded
with diamonds. On the third finger of each hand he wore
two diamond rings. His waistband or belt was a painted
cloth, of the pattern <em>gríngsing sang'u-páti</em>; his <em>krís</em> of the
<em>kaprábon</em>; his <em>jámang</em>, or head ornament, of gold set with
diamonds, and scented with all kinds of sweet-scented oils.
He appeared more beautiful than a deity descended from
heaven, all looking upon him with delight and astonishment.</p>

<p>"His sister, <em>Rétna Jinóli</em>, was dressed nearly after the same
fashion as the Princess <em>Ang'réni</em>.</p>

<p>"The dress of <em>Déwi Ang'réni</em>, when married, was as follows:
her <em>dódot</em> was of a pink colour stamped with flowers;
her <em>kéndit</em> (zone, of which the ends hang in front) was
<em>mandála gíri</em> (yellow with red at each end); her <em>jámang</em> of
golden flowers; her golden ear-rings of the <em>bápang</em> fashion,
with a diamond in the centre; her hair according to the
<em>glung málang</em> (a particular kind of knot), in which were
placed beautiful and sweet-scented flowers; the fine hair
round her forehead fashioned into small curls, with a sprinkling
of powder; her eyebrows shaped like the <em>ímba</em> leaf.
She wore golden armlets of the <em>kálung</em> pattern, ornamented
with drops. Her <em>kálung</em>, or necklace, was of the <em>méng'gah</em>
fashion. She wore two rings on the little and third finger of
each hand, like unto a <em>widadári</em>."</p>

<p>There were three modes of disposing of the body of a deceased
person: by fire, termed <em>óbóng</em>; by water, termed
<em>lárung</em>; or by exposing it upright against a tree in a forest,
where it was left to decay, termed <em>sétra</em>. When the body of a
chief or person of consequence was burnt, it was usual to preserve
the ashes, and to deposit them in a <em>chándi</em> or tomb.</p>

<p>It was the custom with all classes of people on Java to
give an entertainment or feast on the decease of their friends
and relations<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>. The first feast was given on the day of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Vol I Pg 365]</a></span>death, a second on the third day after, a third on the seventh
day, a fourth on the fortieth day, a fifth on the hundredth
day, and a sixth on the thousandth day after the decease of
the party; after which an annual feast was observed, with
more or less pomp, according to the respect in which the deceased
was held, or the circumstances of the friends and relatives
who celebrated his memory.</p>

<p>Besides these regular feasts and ceremonies, others prescribed
by the <em>wúku</em><a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> were religiously observed. When the
day <em>ang'gâra</em> fell on the <em>páncha klíwon</em>, it was considered a
propitious time for preferring petitions to the gods. On the
seventh day of the <em>wúku galingán</em>, sacred to <em>Batára Kámajáya</em>,
they relaxed from all worldly pursuits, and offered
praises and prayers to the gods collectively, it being supposed
that they were assembled on that day. On the <em>wúku gúmreg</em>,
sacred to <em>Batára Sákra</em>, every villager joined in a feast sacred
to the earth (<em>púja búmi</em>); and this <em>wúku</em> was particularly
observed by the people termed <em>Kálang</em>, who, during the seven
days performed no work, but employed themselves in visiting
the tombs of their deceased friends and relations, or in feasting
with their living relatives. During the whole of that period
they kept in their houses a lighted lamp, which they carefully
preserved from extinction.</p>

<p>It may not be inappropriate to introduce in this place a
short digression, containing an account of some of the customs
peculiar to the people termed <em>Kálang</em>, and to the inhabitants
of the <em>Teng'ger</em> mountains. The former are said to
have been at one time numerous in various parts of Java,
leading a wandering life, practising religious rites different
from those of the great body of the people, and avoiding intercourse
with them; but most of them are now reduced to subjection,
are become stationary in their residence, and have
embraced the Mahomedan faith. A few villages in which
their particular customs are still preserved, occur in the provinces
of <em>Kendál</em>, <em>Káliwúng'u</em>, and <em>Démak</em>, and although the
tradition of the country regarding their descent from an unnatural
connection between a princess of <em>Mendang Kamúlan</em>
and a chief, who had been transformed into a dog, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Vol I Pg 366]</a></span>
mark them out as a strange race, they have claims to be considered
as the actual descendants of the aborigines of the
Island<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>. They are represented as having a high veneration
for a <em>red dog</em>, one of which is generally kept by each family,
and which they will, on no account, allow to be struck or ill-used
by any one. When a young man asks a girl in marriage,
he must prove his descent from their peculiar stock. A present
of rice and cotton-yarn, among other articles, must be
offered by him, and carried to the intended bride, by an elderly
man or woman of his own race, which offering must, in like
manner, be received by an elderly relation of the girl: from
this moment until the marriage is duly solemnized, nothing
whatever is allowed to be taken out of either hut. On the
marriage day, a buffalo's head, covered with white, red, or
black rice-powder, is placed on the ground near the place intended
for the bride to sleep upon, and the elderly people and
relations being assembled, they dance by pairs, at the end of
each dance presenting the bride to the bridegroom, and
making such offerings as they think proper. The bridegroom
is, on this occasion, accompanied to the house of the bride's
father by as many friends as he can procure, and is bound to
bring with him not less than a pair of buffaloes, a plough,
harrow, hoe (<em>pachul</em>), and whip, with a bundle of <em>pári</em>.
Those who are in good circumstances are further bound to add
a cart (<em>pedáti</em>) to the above-mentioned stock. Prior to the
equipment of the bride and bridegroom for the entertainment,
it is essential that their bodies be rubbed over with the ashes
of a <em>red dog's</em> bones. At sunset they both eat rice together
off the same leaf. On the following night they jointly partake
of the buffalo's head, which is previously laid by the side of
the place where they sleep. On the third day they proceed
to the house of the bridegroom's father, making as much show
as possible, and go round the extent of the village confines,
preceded by people carrying a bed, cooking utensils, a spinning-wheel
and loom. On the death of a <em>Kálang</em>, the body
is carried in procession to the dwellings of the relations, who
join in the ceremony, and proceed with it to the place of interment:
they then pass round the corpse three times before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Vol I Pg 367]</a></span>it is lowered into the grave, the women crying aloud. A
young cocoa-nut is then split in two, and the water from it
poured into the grave, one-half of the shell being placed at
the head, the other at the feet of the deceased. On their
return home, the feasts and ceremonies are the same as those
noticed in the practice of the other inhabitants of Java.
Whenever the <em>Kálangs</em> move from one place to another, they
are conveyed in carts, having two solid wheels with a revolving
axle, and drawn by two or more pairs of buffaloes, according
to the circumstances of the party. In these they place
the materials of which their huts are constructed, their implements
of husbandry, and other articles of necessity or value.
In this manner, until of late years, since they have been subjected
to the regulations of the Javan chiefs, they were continually
moving from one part of the island to another. They
have still their separate chiefs, and preserve many of their peculiar
customs. Those who are Mahomedans employ in their
religious functions priests who differ from others in being less
scrupulous. They have always been treated with so much
contempt by the Javans, that <em>Kálang</em> is an epithet of reproach
and disgrace.</p>

<p>To the eastward of <em>Surabáya</em>, and on the range of hills
connected with <em>Gúnung Dásar</em>, and lying partly in the district
of <em>Pasúruan</em> and partly in that of <em>Probolingo</em>, known by
the name of the <em>Teng'ger</em> mountains, we find the remnant of
a people still following the Hindu worship, who merit attention,
not only on account of their being, (if we except the
<em>Bédui</em> of Bantam, who will be hereafter noticed) the sole depositaries
of the rites and doctrines of that religion existing
at this day on Java, but as exhibiting an interesting singularity
and simplicity of character.</p>

<p>These people occupy about forty villages, scattered along
this range of hills in the neighbourhood of what is termed the
sandy sea. The site of their villages, as well as the construction
of their houses, are peculiar, and differ entirely from what
is elsewhere observed on Java. They are not shaded by trees,
but built on spacious open terraces, rising one above the
other, each house occupying a terrace, and being in length
from thirty to seventy, and even eighty feet. The door is invariably
in one corner, at the end of the building, opposite to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Vol I Pg 368]</a></span>
that in which the fire-place is built. The building appears to
be constructed with the ordinary roof, having along the front
an enclosed veranda or gallery, about eight feet broad. The
fire-place is built of brick, and is so highly venerated, that it
is considered a sacrilege for any stranger to touch it. Across
the upper part of the building rafters are run, so as to form a
kind of attic story, in which are deposited the most valuable
property and implements of husbandry.</p>

<p>The head of the village takes the title of <em>Péting'gi</em>, as in
the low-lands, and is generally assisted by a <em>Kabáyan</em>, both
elected by the people from their own village. There are four
priests, who are here termed <em>Dúkuns</em> (a term elsewhere only
applied to doctors and midwives), having charge of the state
records and the sacred books.</p>

<p>These <em>Dúkuns</em>, who are in general intelligent men, can
give no account of the era when they were first established
on these hills; they can produce no traditional history of
their origin, whence they came, or who entrusted them with
the sacred books, to the faith contained in which they still
adhere. These, they concur in stating, were handed down to
them by their fathers, to whose hereditary office of preserving
them they have succeeded. The sole duty required of them
is again to hand them down in safety to their children, and
to perform the <em>púja</em> (praise-giving) according to the directions
they contain. These records consist of three compositions,
written on the <em>lóntar</em>-leaf, detailing the origin of the world,
disclosing the attributes of the deity, and prescribing the
forms of worship to be observed on different occasions.</p>

<p>When a woman is delivered of her first child, the <em>Dúkun</em>
takes a leaf of the <em>álang álang</em> grass, and scraping the skin of
the hands of the mother and her infant, as well as the ground,
pronounces a short benediction.</p>

<p>When a marriage is agreed upon, the bride and bridegroom
being brought before the <em>Dúkun</em> within the house, in the first
place bow with respect towards the south, then to the fire-place,
then to the earth, and lastly, on looking up to the
upper story of the house, where the implements of husbandry
are placed. The parties then submissively bowing to the
<em>Dúkun</em>, he repeats a prayer, commencing with the words,
<em>"Hong! Kendága Bráma ang'-gas síwang'ga ána ma siwáha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Vol I Pg 369]</a></span>
sangyang g'ni sira kang</em><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>", &amp;c.; while the bride washes
the feet of the bridegroom. At the conclusion of this ceremony,
the friends and family of the parties make presents to
each of kríses, buffaloes, implements of husbandry, &amp;c.; in
return for which the bride and bridegroom respectfully present
them with betel-leaf.</p>

<p>At the marriage feast which ensues, the <em>Dúkun</em> repeats two
<em>púja</em>. The marriage is not, however, consummated till the
fifth day after the above ceremony. This interval between the
solemnities and the consummation of marriage is termed by
them <em>úndang mántu</em>, and is in some cases still observed by
the Javans in other parts of the island, under the name <em>únduh
mántu</em>.</p>

<p>At the interment of an inhabitant of <em>Teng'ger</em>, the corpse is
lowered into the grave with the head placed towards the
south (contrary to the direction observed by the Mahomedans),
and is guarded from the immediate contact of the earth by a
covering of <em>bámbus</em> and planks. When the grave is closed,
two posts are planted over the body; one erected perpendicularly
on the breast, the other on the lower part of the belly;
and between them is placed a hollowed <em>bámbu</em> in an inverted
position, into which, during seven successive days, they daily
pour a vessel of pure water, laying beside the <em>bámbu</em> two
dishes, also daily replenished with eatables. At the expiration
of the seventh day, the feast of the dead is announced,
and the relations and friends of the deceased assemble to be
present at the ceremony, and to partake of entertainments
conducted in the following manner.</p>

<p>A figure of about half a cubit high, representing the human
form, made of leaves and ornamented with variegated flowers,
is prepared and placed in a conspicuous situation, supported
round the body by the clothes of the deceased. The <em>Dúkun</em>
then places in front of the garland an incense-pot with burning
ashes, together with a vessel containing water, and repeats
the two <em>púja</em> to fire and water; the former commencing with
"<em>Hong! Kendága Bráma gangsi wang'ga ya nama síwáha</em>,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Vol I Pg 370]</a></span>&amp;c.; the latter with "<em>Hong! hong gang'ga máha tirta ráta
mejil sáking háti</em>," &amp;c.; burning <em>dúpa</em> or incense at stated
periods during the former, and occasionally sprinkling the
water over the feast during the repetition of the latter.</p>

<p>The clothes of the deceased are then divided among the relatives
and friends; the garland is burned; another <em>púja</em>,
commencing with "<em>Hong! áwigna mastúna ma sidam,
hong! aráning</em>," &amp;c. is repeated, while the remains of the
sacred water are sprinkled over the feast. The parties now
sit down to the enjoyment of it, invoking a blessing from the
Almighty on themselves, their houses, and their lands. No
more solemnities are observed till the expiration of a thousand
days, when, if the memory of the deceased is beloved and
cherished, the ceremony and feast are repeated; if otherwise,
no further notice is taken of him: and having thus obtained
what the Romans would call his <em>justa</em>, he is allowed to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Being questioned regarding the tenets of their religion, they
replied that they believed in a <em>déwa</em>, who was all-powerful;
that the name by which the <em>déwa</em> was designated was <em>Búmi
Trúka Sáng'yáng Dewáta Bâtur</em>, and that the particulars of
their worship were contained in a book called <em>Pángláwu</em>,
which they presented to me.</p>

<p>On being questioned regarding the <em>ádat</em> against adultery,
theft, and other crimes, their reply was unanimous and ready,
that crimes of this kind were unknown to them, and that consequently
no punishment was fixed, either by law or custom;
that if a man did wrong, the head of the village chid him for
it, the reproach of which was always sufficient punishment for
a man of <em>Teng'ger</em>. This account of their moral character is
fully confirmed by the Regents of the districts under whose
authority they are placed, and also by the Residents. They,
in fact, seem to be almost without crime, and are universally
peaceable, orderly, honest, industrious, and happy. They are
unacquainted with the vice of gambling and the use of opium.</p>

<p>The aggregate population is about twelve hundred souls;
and they occupy, without exception, the most beautifully
rich and romantic spots on Java; a region, in which the
thermometer is frequently as low as forty-two. The summits
and slopes of the hills are covered with Alpine firs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Vol I Pg 371]</a></span>
plants common to an European climate flourish in luxuriance.</p>

<p>Their language does not differ much from the Javan of the
present day, though more gutturally pronounced. Upon a
comparison of about a hundred words with the vernacular
Javan, two only were found to differ. They do not marry or
intermix with the people of the low-lands, priding themselves
on their independence and purity in this respect<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Vol I Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>Bédui</em> are in numbers inconsiderable, and found in the
interior of Bantam: they are the descendants of those who
escaped into the woods after the fall of the western capital of
<em>Pajajáran</em><a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> in the fifteenth century, and would not change
their religion, remaining firmly attached to that of <em>Prábu
Séda</em>. There is a tomb of one of them which they hold
sacred, and will not allow any one but themselves to approach
even to this day. When the <em>Bédui</em> subsequently submitted
to the Sultan of Bantam, and shewed no disposition to oppose
the Mahomedans, they were not compelled to become converts;
but it was agreed, at the same time they admitted, that the
number of the <em>Rowá-ian</em> (the name given to their little societies)
should be limited to three or four.</p>

<p>The <em>Bédui</em> attend to all orders they receive through the
medium of the village chief. They subsist by cultivating
rice: all they raise beyond what is required for their own
consumption they sell to the hill people, who are in the habit
of going to them for it once a year, on account of the superior
quality of the rice, or rather superior estimation in which it
is held. It is an established rule among them to allot but one
day for each of the different successive operations of husbandry:
one day for cutting down the trees and underwood,
one day for clearing what has been so cut down, one day for
sowing the grain, one for weeding the field, and one for
reaping, one for binding up the grain and one for carrying it
home. If any part of what has been reaped cannot be carried
home in one day, it is left and neglected. The <em>Gírang póhon</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Vol I Pg 373]</a></span>(which is the title of the chief) is the first who commences
the work of the field, and many of the hill people follow him
in regard to the period for sowing their <em>pári</em>.</p>

<p>Their dress consists of white and black cloths. They
wear rings and silver scabbards to their <em>krises</em>, but gold and
<em>swasa</em> they dislike. Spanish dollars are the only coin they
prize.</p>

<p>The festivals or feasts of the Javans are of three kinds: the
<em>grébeg</em>, or religious festivals; the <em>bancháki</em> or <em>nealamáti</em>, so
called from the Arabic <em>salámat</em> (a blessing), held on the celebration
of marriages, births, and circumcision; and the
<em>sedékah</em>, appointed in honour of the dead, and for the celebration
of their memory.</p>

<p>The principal and most important of these are the national
entertainments corresponding with the Mahomedan festivals of
<em>múlut</em>, <em>pása</em>, and <em>bésar</em>; the two first answering to the half-yearly
festivals of the Arabs of <em>moháram</em> and <em>ramázan</em>, and
the latter with that of <em>kháji</em>, in the month of dulkhija. On
these occasions the sovereign appears in public, and the <em>álun
álun</em> is crowded with an assemblage of people from all
quarters, every one being dressed in his most splendid attire,
and accompanied by all his armed followers. The same is
observed in the more distant provinces of the country, where
the petty chiefs, in like manner, assemble in the <em>álun álun</em> of
the Regent. Presents of fruit, poultry, and other kinds of
provisions, are brought from every part of the country:
offerings are made by the chiefs to the mosques, and a public
festival is given by the chief authorities. The men only partake
of these public feasts; but the female part of the family
of the chiefs assemble together, and enjoy corresponding
entertainments within their chambers. The festival seldom
lasts above one day.</p>

<p>Of the <em>bancháki</em> and <em>nealamáti</em> it may be only necessary
to observe, that those given during the ceremonies consequent
upon the birth of the first child are most important.</p>

<p>The <em>sedékah</em> are solemnities observed on the occasion of
the funeral, or in honour of the memory of a departed relative,
on the seventh, fortieth, one hundredth, or thousandth day
after his decease: they are distinguished from the feasts
of <em>grébeg</em> and <em>nealamáti</em> by the absence of music. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Vol I Pg 374]</a></span>
who intend to observe them, assemble on the preceding
evening in order to read some portion of the <em>Koran</em>. Before
the guests partake of the meal, the principal person present
generally addresses the Almighty in a prayer, which alludes
to the occasion, and expresses gratitude for the repast which
his bounty has provided. Thankfulness to the earthly donor
of the entertainment often mingles itself with gratitude to
heaven, and the praises of both are celebrated at the same
time. This grace before meals is called <em>dúng'a</em>.</p>

<p>Reserving for a subsequent chapter a sketch of the music
and poetry of the Javans, I shall in this place endeavour to
give some account of their national drama and dances, as
constituting, next to music and poetry, the most conspicuous
and refined of their amusements.</p>

<p>The dramatic entertainments are of two kinds; the <em>tópeng</em>,
wherein the characters are represented by men, who except
when performing before the Sovereign wear masks; and the
<em>wáyang</em>, in which they are represented by shadows.</p>

<p>The subject of the <em>tópeng</em> is invariably taken from the
adventures of <em>Pánji</em>, the favourite hero of Javan story. In
the performances before the Sovereign, where masks are not
used, the several characters themselves rehearse their parts;
but, in general, the <em>Dálang</em>, or manager of the entertainment,
recites the speeches, while the performers have only to "suit
the action to the word." The music of the <em>gámelan</em> accompanies
the piece, and varies in expression, according to the
nature of the action or the kind of emotion to be excited.
The actors are splendidly dressed after the ancient costume,
and perform their parts with grace, elegance, and precision;
but the whole performance has more the character of a ballet
than that of a regular dramatic exhibition, either of the tragic
or coming kind, in which human passions, human follies
or sufferings, are represented in such appropriate language
and just action, as to seem only a reflection of nature. Love
and war are the constant themes, and the combats of contending
chiefs generally close the scene. Those who perform
before the sovereign and repeat their parts, previously study
their characters from written compositions expressly prepared
for the purpose; but in other cases, the <em>Dálang</em>, well versed
in the principal incidents, descriptions, and speeches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Vol I Pg 375]</a></span>
history, furnishes the dialogue between the actors extempore.
A party of <em>tôpeng</em>  generally consists of ten persons, besides
the <em>Dálang</em>, of whom four play the <em>gámelan</em> and six perform
the characters. They are engaged to play by the night, for
about ten rupees (twenty-five shillings) and a supper.</p>

<p>Buffoonery is sometimes introduced, to increase the zest of
these entertainments with the multitude, but it does not
interfere with the regular course of the performance, the actors
being only disturbed occasionally by the actions of an extraneous
character, who whether representing a dog, a monkey,
or an idiot, seldom fails to excite considerable mirth, and
not unfrequently in the most interesting part of the performance.</p>

<p>There is also a kind of pantomime, or rather an assemblage
of wild beasts called <em>Barúng'an</em>; in this entertainment men
dressed up to represent various animals are made to appear
in procession and combats. This is generally performed for
the amusement of children, and is only accompanied by the
beat of the <em>góng</em> and drum.</p>

<p>In the <em>wáyangs</em>, or scenic shadows, the subject of the performances
is taken from the earliest period of history and
fable, down to the destruction of the Hindu empire of <em>Majapáhit</em>.
These are distinguished according to the periods of
the history which they represent, by the terms <em>wáyang púrwa</em>,
<em>wáyang gédog</em>, and <em>wáyang klítik</em>.</p>

<p>The different characters in the history are in these <em>wáyangs</em>
represented by figures, about eighteen inches or two feet
high, stamped or cut out of pieces of thick leather, generally
of buffalo's hide, which are painted and gilt with great care
and at considerable expense, so as to form some supposed
resemblance of the character to the individual intended to be
personified. The whole figure is, however, strangely distorted
and grotesque, the nose in particular being unnaturally prominent.
There is a tradition, that the figures were first
so distorted by the <em>Susúnan Mória</em>, one of the early Mahomedan
teachers, in order to render the preservation of the
ancient amusements of the country compatible with a due
obedience to the Mahomedan precept, which forbids any
exhibition or dramatic representation of the human form.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Vol I Pg 376]</a></span>
"By these means," said the <em>Susúnan</em> with much ingenuity,
"while the world in general will not imagine the figures to
be human, the Javans, from recollecting their history, will
yet be able to comprehend the characters they are intended
to represent, and enjoy in secret their national amusements.
Or if, in time, they should forget the originals, and confound
them with the distorted resemblance, they will be impressed
with the idea, that it was only after conversion to the faith
of the Prophet that their ancestors assumed the present
shape of man." But the comparatively recent alteration
in the figures is rendered doubtful from the circumstance of
similar figures being found on many of the more ancient
coins, thus affording ground for an opinion, that they existed
nearly in their present form before the introduction of Mahomedanism.
Their antiquity is further confirmed, by the
existence of similar figures in the Hindu island of <em>Báli</em>,
where, though not so much distorted, they are still far from
natural. These figures are fastened upon a horn spike, and
have a piece of thin horn hanging from each hand, by means
of which the arms, which are jointed at the elbow and
shoulder, can be moved at the discretion of the manager. A
white cloth or curtain is then drawn tight over an oblong
frame of ten or twelve feet long and five feet high, and being
placed in front of the spectators, is rendered transparent by
means of a hanging lamp behind it. The several figures are
made in turn to appear and act their parts. Previous to the
commencement of this performance, the <em>Dálang</em>, who is
seated behind the curtain, arranges the different characters on
each side of the curtain, by sticking them into a long plantain
stem which is laid along the bottom. The <em>gámelan</em> then
commences, and as the several characters present themselves,
extracts of the history are repeated, and the dialogue is carried
on, generally at the discretion and by the invention of
the <em>Dálang</em>. Without this personage nothing can be done;
for he not only puts the puppets in motion, but repeats their
parts, interspersing them with detached verses from the
romance illustrative of the story, and descriptive of the qualities
of the different heroes. He is the soul which directs
and animates the whole order and machinery of the piece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Vol I Pg 377]</a></span>
regulating the time of the music with a small hammer which
he holds in his hand, while he recites the speeches suited to
the occasion.</p>

<p>In the <em>wáyang purwa</em>, or <em>wáyang</em> of the most ancient times,
the subject is taken from the earliest periods of fabulous history,
down to the reign of <em>Parikésit</em> inclusive. This is the
age of interesting story and marvellous fiction, the reign of
the gods, demigods, and heroes of the Hindu and Javan
mythology, who in these representations are exhibited with
the attributes, and in the situations with which their names
are connected in the most popular poems and romances. The
fables thus turned to account, are generally taken from the
poem of <em>Ráma</em>, the poem of <em>Mintarága</em> containing the penance
of <em>Arjúna</em> on the mountain <em>Indra</em>, and the celebrated epic of
the <em>Bráta Yúdha</em>, or the war of the <em>Pandáwa</em>. These poems
are all written in what are termed the high measures, and are
accompanied in their recital by the <em>gámelan saléndro</em>. In the
performance of this <em>wáyang</em>, the <em>Dálang</em> first recites a few
verses in the <em>Káwi</em> language, chaunting afterwards an interpretation
of the passage in Javan, for the use of the unlearned.
As the several characters are brought forward, he himself supplies
the minor dialogue between the dramatis personæ, keeping
in general close to the original story, when there is any
person present who could detect his deviations: if he is performing
before the ignorant, however, he frequently digresses
from the main story, in any way which he thinks may most
readily amuse his audience; and on this account, the practice
of rendering the <em>Káwi</em> into Javan, which furnishes an opportunity
for such deviations, is termed <em>charángan</em>, literally a
branch from a tree. In the course of the entertainment, all
the varieties of ancient weapons named in these poems are
represented behind the transparent curtain. The interest excited
by such spectacles, connected with national recollections,
is almost inconceivable. The eager multitude will sit listening
with rapturous delight and profound attention for whole
nights to these rude dramas. By means of them, the lower
class have an opportunity of picking up a few <em>Káwi</em> terms,
and of becoming acquainted with the ancient legends of the
country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Vol I Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject of the <em>wáyang gédog</em> is taken from the period
of history subsequent to <em>Parikésit</em>, commencing with the reign
of <em>Gandra-yána</em> and including the adventures and reign of
the celebrated <em>Pánji</em>, and that of his successor <em>Laléan</em>, until
he established himself at <em>Pajajáran</em>. These poems being
composed in a different measure, the <em>gámelan pélog</em> is employed
as the accompaniment; and although the history of
the early part of this period is written in the <em>Káwi</em>, the <em>Dálang</em>
always employs the Javan translation. The adventures
of <em>Pánji</em> compose the most popular portion of it. The characters
are numerous, and the figures in general more highly
coloured and better finished than those of the <em>wáyang púrwa</em>.
In bringing any hero on the stage, the <em>Dálang</em> recites those
verses of the history which relate to him, and introduces such
dialogue as may give a dramatic effect to the exhibition, together
with such explanations as may make it intelligible to
common capacities.</p>

<p>In the <em>wáyang klítik</em> the figures exhibited are more properly
puppets than shadows: they are of wood, about ten
inches high, and made to perform their parts without the intervention
of a curtain. In these are represented that portion
of the history commencing with the establishment of the
western empire of <em>Pajajáran</em> and ending with the destruction
of the eastern empire of <em>Majapáhit</em>. Of this, by far the most
favourite scenes are found in the popular story of the adventures
between the <em>Ménak Jíng'ga</em>, a chief of <em>Balambáng'an</em>,
and <em>Dámar Wúlan</em> (the light of the moon), on account of the
Princess of <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>The compositions which thus serve as the basis of these
popular and interesting entertainments, comprise the legends
from which the account of the earlier periods of Javan story,
detailed in another part of this work, is principally derived.
The most popular and interesting events and adventures are
preserved and related in various compositions, whilst more
recent actions and events, which possessed less interest, have
fallen into oblivion. The constant exhibition of these plays
in every part of the country, but more particularly in the
eastern districts, has served to keep alive the recollections of
"days long since gone by," and to disseminate a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Vol I Pg 379]</a></span>
knowledge of native legendary history among many, with
whom, from the ignorance of letters, the stories might otherwise
have been irretrievably lost or more grossly distorted.</p>

<p>The <em>Dálangs</em>, who manage and conduct these amusements,
are treated with considerable respect. In many points, their
office strongly resembles that of the ancient bards. The ceremony
of giving his blessing to the first born infant, in the repetition
of some particular passages of the ancient legends,
gives this part of his office a very peculiar interest. The usual
payment to the <em>Dálang</em> who owns a set of <em>wáyangs</em>, and brings
his own <em>gámelan</em> players, is from two to three dollars for the
night; but the nobles and chiefs generally have several sets
of <em>wáyangs</em> of their own, and keep a <em>Dálang</em> in their service.</p>

<p>Another representation of this nature is that of the adventures
of <em>Ménak Jing'ga</em> and <em>Dámar Wúlan</em>, which are exhibited,
but not very commonly, by means of drawings on
folded leaves of strong paper, while the <em>Dálang</em> repeats the
story and furnishes dialogue to the characters. This is termed
<em>wáyang béber</em>. An entertainment of a similar description,
though not accompanied by the exhibition of figures, is termed
<em>trébang</em>: it was invented in the time of the kingdom of <em>Démak</em>.
The story is taken from the Arabic account of <em>Begínda
Ambia</em>, which being rendered into Javan, is repeated by the
<em>Dálang</em>, who with a small drum before him, and accompanied
by the music of the <em>gámelun</em>, gives spirit to the different parts,
by beating time with his hand, and varying the strength of
the sound or quickness of time according to the subject. These
two latter are of comparatively modern invention, and not
much esteemed.</p>

<p>The dance with the Javans, as with Asiatics in general,
consists in graceful attitudes of the body, and in the slow
movement of the arms and legs, particularly of the former, even
to the distinct motion of the hand and fingers.</p>

<p>Of the dancing girls who exhibit at public entertainments,
the first in rank and the most skilful in their profession are
the concubines of the sovereign and of the hereditary prince.
They alone are allowed to perform the <em>s'rímpi</em>, a figure dance
by four persons, distinguished by an unusual degree of grace
and decorum.</p>

<p>The dancers are decorated according to the ancient cos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Vol I Pg 380]</a></span>tume
of the country, and nearly in the same manner as a modern
bride. The <em>tápih</em>, or petticoat, is of silk of different
colours, often green stamped with golden flowers, and hanging
in the most graceful manner, a part of it falling between
the feet and serving as a short train, which in the course of
the dance is frequently thrown aside by a quicker motion of
the foot than ordinary. The <em>údat</em>, or waistband, is of the
<em>chíndi</em> pattern; and on these occasions is worn the <em>mer</em>, or
cestus, composed of plates of gold highly ornamented with
diamonds at the clasp in front. The body is enclosed in a
kind of corset (<em>pemákak</em>) passing above the bosom and under
the arms, and confining the waist in the narrowest possible
limits. The ends of the <em>sémbong</em>, or sash, fall gracefully on
each side on the back of the hip and reach the ground. Sometimes,
indeed, this graceful appendage to the dress is brought
from the back to a point between the breasts, whence being
fastened in a rosette, the ends flow towards the ground in
front of the person, the usual bending attitude during the
dance causing them to hang distinct from the rest of the apparel.
The triple necklace, richly chased armlets, bracelets,
and tiara, are of gold, studded with precious stones; and the
hair is gracefully ornamented with buds of white and sweet-scented
flowers. On their fingers they generally display brilliant
rings, and the face, neck, shoulders, and arms, which
remain uncovered, are tinged by a delicate shade of yellow
powder. The music is slow and solemn, and the performance
is on the <em>gámelan saléndro</em>; verses from the romances of
<em>Pánji</em>, descriptive of the attire and beauty of the wives and
concubines of that hero, being chaunted as a prelude to the
entertainment and during its continuance. On occasions
when the <em>s'rímpi</em> are exhibited before Europeans at the Residency
house, they are brought with great care, and under a
guard, from the <em>kráton</em>, in a large enclosed palanquin, or
rather box, borne on men's shoulders. When they reach the
door of the residency, they glide behind the prince into the
chamber appropriated for his accommodation, and when they
come forth for the dance, seat themselves on the ground in
front of him. On his intimating that they should commence,
they slowly, and to the sound of music, close their hands,
and raising them to the forehead, bend in reverential awe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Vol I Pg 381]</a></span>
and gradually extending their arms and swaying in unison
with each other from side to side, assume an erect posture.
The dancers seldom exceed the age of fourteen or fifteen.
The birth of a child generally puts an end to their performances,
and removes them from the profession. They are the
choicest beauties of the country, selected for the royal bed.
Throughout the whole performance their eyes are directed
modestly to the ground, and their body and limbs are by slow
movements thrown into every graceful attitude that the most
flexible form is capable of exhibiting. In the figure of the
dance they occasionally approach and recede from each other,
and sometimes cross to the opposite side. It frequently happens,
that the delicate corset by falling too low, exposes more
of the body than is considered correct. On such occasions,
one of the trusty matrons always in attendance raises it again,
without interrupting the dance or embarrassing the movements
of the dancer. At the conclusion of the dance they gradually
place themselves on the ground, in the same manner as before
its commencement, and after closing their hands, and raising
them to the forehead in token of respect, remain seated with
a downcast look and captivating modesty, until the signal is
given to the matrons to relieve them by others, when they
again glide into the same apartment.</p>

<p>The <em>bedáya</em>, who perform a figure dance of eight persons,
are in some respect to the nobles what the <em>s'rímpi</em> are to the
sovereign: but, at present, few of the nobles can afford to
maintain a sufficient number of youthful concubines to compose
this dance; it is frequently therefore performed by boys
trained for the purpose. They are dressed nearly in the same
manner as the <em>s'rímpi</em>, though not so expensively. The
action moves to the same music and song.</p>

<p>But the common dancing girls of the country, who appear
to approach more nearly to the usual dancing girls of Western
India, are called <em>róng'geng</em>, and are generally of easy virtue.
They make a profession of their art, and hire themselves to
perform on particular occasions, for the amusement of the
chiefs and of the public. Though to be found in every principal
town, their performance is most highly esteemed in the
western, and particularly among the rude mountaineers of the
<em>Súnda</em> districts, where the superior graces of the <em>bedáya</em> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Vol I Pg 382]</a></span>
unknown. Here they are constantly engaged on every occasion
of festivity, and the regents frequently keep the most
accomplished in their service for years. Their conduct is
generally so incorrect, as to render the title of <em>róng'geng</em> and
prostitute synonymous; but it not unfrequently happens, that
after amassing considerable wealth in the profession, they
obtain, on account of their fortune, the hand of some petty
chief. In this case, they generally, after a few years retirement
and domestic quiet, avail themselves of the facility of
a divorce, and repudiating their husbands, return to their
former habits. The <em>róng'gengs</em> accompany the dance with
singing, the words being generally extempore to the music of
the <em>gámelan saléndro</em> and <em>pélog</em>. Their dress is coarse, but
in other respects resembles that of the more select dancers.
They do not, however, wear any tiara on the head, nor armlets;
bracelets are only worn occasionally. Their hair is dressed
after a peculiar fashion, abundantly oiled, and ornamented
with flowers of various kinds. They sometimes exhibit singly
and sometimes in groups, following and approaching each
other, or receding at pleasure. They perform at any time of
the day, but chiefly in the evening, and endeavour to exhibit
their best attitudes round a lamp which hangs suspended.
Generally speaking, both their action and their song are rude
and awkward, and on that account often disgusting to Europeans,
although there are some among them whose performance
does not deserve to be so considered. Their action
is usually distorted, their greatest excellence seeming to consist
in bending the arms and hands back in an unnatural
manner, and giving one or two of the fingers a tremulous
motion. The voice, though sometimes harmonious, is often
loud, dissonant, and harsh to an European ear. They generally
have a handkerchief thrown over the shoulder, and usually a
fan in their hand, which occasionally serves to conceal one
half of the face, not so much out of any affectation of bashfulness,
as, in the manner of a huntsman, to assist the louder
tones of the voice. At other times it is employed to strike
against the back of the arm, so as to give a greater effect to
different parts of the action and music. Generally speaking,
the <em>róng'gengs</em> do not descend to the performance of those
disgusting and disgraceful postures and motions, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Vol I Pg 383]</a></span>
stated to be so frequent on the continent of India, but they are
not free from the charge of impropriety in this respect. Their
song, though little esteemed and less understood by Europeans,
sometimes possesses much humour and drollery; and in
adapting their motions to the language, they frequently excite
loud bursts of laughter, and obtain great applause from the
native audience.</p>

<p>The nobles of the highest rank are accustomed, on particular
occasions of festivity, to join in the dance with a
<em>róng'geng</em>. To dance gracefully, is an accomplishment expected
in every Javan of rank; and in the western districts,
particularly, all the chiefs are, on days of festivity, accustomed
to join in the exercise, one after the other, commencing with
the youngest. On these occasions, the nobles of the highest
class vie with each other in pointing the toe with grace, in
exhibiting elegance of movement, in displaying adroitness by
intricate evolutions, or beauty of person by an ingenious
management of attitude. So devoted are they to this exercise,
that although their wives and daughters never dance, the
happiness of a festive occasion is considered incomplete,
where an opportunity is not afforded to the chiefs themselves
of introducing their favourite amusement. In the <em>Súnda</em>
districts, there are some individuals distinguished as regular
posture or dancing-masters.</p>

<p>It is not unusual for the performances of the <em>róng'gengs</em>
to be varied by the action of a fool or buffoon. Mimicry is
a favourite amusement, and beside imitating, in a ludicrous
manner, the actions of the <em>róng'gengs</em>, there are not wanting
performers of this description, who occasionally direct their
wit against all classes of society, and evince a considerable
degree of low humour.</p>

<p>These are the only public exhibitions of the female sex;
but the posture dances by the men are numerous, and contribute
to the state of the sovereigns and chiefs. Among these,
the <em>Gámbuh</em>, with a shield on one arm, gracefully raises the
<em>dódot</em> (or petticoat) with the other hand; the <em>Niutra</em>, having
a bow and arrow in the hand, goes through the motion of its
exercise, stringing and unstringing it to the sound of the
<em>gámelan</em>. Both throw their limbs and body into the most
graceful postures, as they slowly move in procession before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Vol I Pg 384]</a></span>
the chiefs, or are arranged on the side of the passage through
which he is to pass. Both the <em>Gámbuh</em> and <em>Niutra</em> are
naked from the waist upwards, while the <em>dódot</em> hangs to the
ground on one side in the manner of full dress, shewing the
knee on the other. Their bodies are generally covered with
yellow powder, and from round their ears hang suspended in
front, strings of the young <em>meláti</em> flowers.</p>

<p>The <em>Gámbuh</em> are occasionally employed to exhibit before
the prince, when with a <em>krís</em> in their right hand and a shield
on their left arm, they go through all their evolutions to the
sound of music.</p>

<p>But the chief description of male performers are the <em>Béksa
kémbang</em> or <em>Béksa rong'geng</em>, who have flowers, shields, or
serpents in their hands, and in dancing seem to resemble the
South Sea Islanders, though more elegant in their attire, and
perhaps more graceful in their motions. Neither have any
covering above the waist; but the yellow, and sometimes
green powder which is upon the body, gives it an appearance
very like dress. The term <em>Béksa láwung</em> is applied to the
petty chiefs, who on public days dismount from their horses,
and go through the exercise of the spear for the amusement
of the prince. Another description of performers are termed
<em>Unchelang</em>; their art consists in throwing the spear into the
air, and catching it again as it falls with great dexterity.
Similar exhibitions of these persons combating with sticks,
called <em>újung</em>, were formerly common.</p>

<p>In the domestic circle, the women and elderly people are
partial to a peculiar amusement termed <em>sintren</em>, which paints
very forcibly the notions they possess of the power of music.
A boy or girl, properly attired and skilled in the dance, is
placed under a reversed basket which is carefully covered
with cloth. Round it music and song are struck up by all
present; those who do not play on any instrument, or who do
not sing, joining in beating time by clapping their hands.
When the excitement has continued sufficiently long to be
supposed to have effected the charm, the basket is seen to
move, and the boy or girl rising from under it, apparently
unconscious of what is doing, moves and dances gracefully
but wildly, in unison with the music. At length tired out,
the dancer falls and seems to sink into sleep, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Vol I Pg 385]</a></span>
awakened pretends not to recollect any thing that has passed.
The perfection of this amusement consists in the performer's
giving himself up so completely to the power of music as to
be charmed by it, and perfectly unconscious of every other
sense.</p>

<p>For the amusement, principally however of children, a
cocoa-nut shell is carved with the features of a man, and
affixed to the top of a reversed basket, covered with cloth.
This basket, after being for some time exposed by the side of
a river, or under a large tree, in order, as is supposed, that
some supernatural spirit may enter into it, is brought again
into the house, and rocked according to the swaying motion
of the Javan dance by two children, to the music of the <em>gámelan</em>.
An amusement of this kind is termed <em>bríndung</em>.</p>

<p>Tilts and tournaments (<em>wátang</em>) form a favourite and constant
diversion with the Javans: they are exhibited principally
in the <em>álun álun</em>, or great square in front of the <em>kráton</em>,
or palace, and compose an essential part of the ceremony of
the <em>pásar senén</em>, or the day in which the sovereign and regents
appear in public. This, with the sovereign, is Saturday;
with the chiefs, Monday. On the afternoon of this day,
all the princes, nobles, and public officers assemble, and arranging
themselves in the places assigned to their respective
ranks, await the coming out of the sovereign, who, as soon as
he descends from the <em>setíngel</em>, mounts a horse richly caparisoned,
and rides round the <em>waríngen</em> trees, the several chiefs
joining in his suite as he passes the circle. Several of the
chiefs, and particularly their sons and youthful relations, then
join in pairs, tilting and striking their long and blunted spears
as they pass the sovereign. The same thing is observed on
the afternoon of every Monday, at the capitals of the different
provinces throughout the island, where the native government
and institutions are at all preserved. The assemblage of
people on these occasions is frequently very great. The trappings
and housings of the horses are extremely rich, and the
riders perform their feats with some dexterity, being seldom
unhorsed<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>. At the conclusion of the exhibition on horseback,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Vol I Pg 386]</a></span>it is not unusual for the youths and petty chiefs who
have contended in the saddle to dismount and practice the
attack and defence of the spear on foot: they are then termed
<em>Béksa láwung</em>. Tilts are likewise exhibited in the <em>álun
álun</em> on the days of public festival, when the chiefs appear.</p>

<p>The Javans have long advanced beyond that state in which
the chace was considered as connected with their subsistence.</p>

<p>The stag is hunted chiefly in the eastern and western extremities
of the island, by the descendants of the <em>Báli</em> and
<em>Súnda</em> races: the Javans inhabiting the central districts are
not practised in the diversion, nor much acquainted with
it. They uniformly pursue the animal on horseback. In the
eastern districts he is killed with a spear: in the western he
is cut down with a <em>kléwang</em> or cutlass; here the chace is conducted
with more regularity and method, and many of the
inhabitants, particularly the chiefs, are passionately addicted
to it, employing the best and swiftest horses and dogs they
can procure for the purpose.</p>

<p>A favourite and national spectacle is the combat between
the buffalo and the tiger. A large cage of <em>bámbu</em> or wood is
erected, the ends of which are fixed into the ground, in which
the buffalo is first and the tiger afterwards admitted, through
openings reserved for the purpose. It seldom fails that the
buffalo is triumphant, and one buffalo has been known to destroy
several full grown tigers in succession. In these combats
the buffalo is stimulated by the constant application of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Vol I Pg 387]</a></span>boiling water, which is poured over him from the upper part
of the cage, and of nettles, which are fastened to the end of a
stick, and applied by persons seated in the same quarter. The
tiger sometimes springs upon the buffalo at once; he very generally,
however, avoids the combat, until goaded by sticks and
roused by the application of burning straw, when he moves
round the cage, and being gored by the buffalo, seizes him by
the neck, head, or leg. The buffalo is often dreadfully torn,
and seldom survives the combat many days. In these entertainments
the Javans are accustomed to compare the buffalo
to the Javan and the tiger to the European, and it may be
readily imagined with what eagerness they look to the success
of the former. The combat generally lasts from twenty minutes
to half an hour, when, if neither of them is destroyed,
the animals are changed, and the tiger, if he survives, is removed
to be destroyed in the manner called <em>rámpog</em>, which is
as follows.</p>

<p>On receiving information of the retreat of a tiger the male
inhabitants are sometimes called out in a body, by the order
of a chief, each man being obliged to be provided with a
spear, the common weapon of the country. The place where
the animal is concealed is surrounded: a double or triple
range being formed, according to the number of hunters, and
he is roused by shouts, by the beating of <em>gongs</em>, or by fire.
The place where he is expected to attempt his escape is carefully
guarded, and he is generally speared on the spot.</p>

<p>In many districts, where the population is not deficient, the
appearance of a single <em>tiger</em> rouses the neighbourhood, and he
is infallibly destroyed by the method described<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<p>When the <em>rámpog</em> is resorted to by way of amusement at
the capital of the sovereign, a hollow square of spearmen, four
deep, is formed on the <em>álun álun</em>, in the centre of which are
placed the tigers in small separate cages, or rather traps, with
a sliding door, in the manner of a rat-trap. Two or three
men, accustomed to the practice, at the command of the sovereign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Vol I Pg 388]</a></span>
proceed into the centre of the square, and placing
plaited leaves in front of the cage, to supply the place of the
wooden door, set it on fire, and drawing the wooden door up,
throwing it on one side, themselves retreating from the spot at
a slow pace, to the sound of music. As soon as the tiger feels
the fire he starts, and in endeavouring to make his way through
the spearmen is generally received upon their weapons. Instances,
however, have occurred, in which the animal has
made good his retreat, but he was soon afterwards killed;
sometimes the tiger, particularly if he has been opposed to the
buffalo, will not move from the centre of the square; in which
case the sovereign generally directs six or eight of his choice
men (<em>gándek</em>) to advance towards him with spears. This
they do with surprizing coolness and intrepidity, never failing
to pierce the animal, by fixing their spears into him at once.
The smaller species of the tiger is generally selected for this
amusement.</p>

<p>The exposure of criminals in combat with tigers was formerly
practised, and it is said to have been common on the first
establishment of the <em>Matárem</em> empire; but of late years, such
a method of deriving amusement from the infliction of judicial
punishment had almost become obsolete, and is now, as well
as mutilation and torture, altogether abolished by treaty. Several
instances are said to have occurred during the reign of
the sultan of <em>Yúgya-kérta</em> who was deposed by the British
Government in 1812. In an exhibition of this kind, which
took place about ten years ago, two criminals were exposed
for having set fire to a dwelling. They were provided each
with a <em>krís</em>, which was long, but broken off or blunted at the
point, and the tiger was let in upon them separately in a large
cage constructed for the purpose. The first was soon destroyed,
but the second, after a combat of nearly two hours,
succeeded in killing the tiger, by repeated cuts about the
head and under the ears and eyes. On this a smaller tiger,
or rather leopard, was let in upon him, and the criminal being
equally successful in this combat was released. His success,
as in the judicial ordeals of the dark ages, was taken for a
manifestation by heaven of his innocence, and not only secured
his pardon, but procured for him the rank of a <em>Mántri</em>, as a
recompense for the danger to which he was exposed in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Vol I Pg 389]</a></span>
vindication. Although this barbarous practice appears so
recently to have been resorted to, it is not to be inferred that,
as a spectacle, it is held in any estimation by the Javans in
general. It seems to have been of comparatively late introduction,
and adopted only in the policy of a known and avowed
tyrant. The concourse of spectators to witness the combat
can no more stamp the general character of the people with
barbarity, than the crowds which are always present at public
executions in Europe. The bare relation of the fact excites
feelings of horror in the mind of the ordinary chief.</p>

<p>Bull-fighting is common on <em>Madúra</em> and in the eastern
parts of the island; but it is perfectly different from any
species of sport derived from the courage or ferocity of that
animal in Europe. Here, neither dogs are employed as in
England, nor men and horses as in Spain, but the bulls themselves
are directed against each other. The population form
an extensive ring round the <em>álun álun</em>, within which the animals
are first led up to a cow, until they are sufficiently excited,
when the cow being withdrawn they are set at liberty
and contend with each other, until one of them gives way, and
is driven from within the ring by the victor. The small well
formed bulls of <em>Súmenáp</em> afford considerable amusement in
this way, while considerable bets are laid on the result of the
combat.</p>

<p>The combat between the ram and wild hog, which generally
terminates by several dogs being let in to complete the
destruction of the latter, is an exhibition which furnishes
frequent amusement; a small stand is raised for the ram, to
which he can retreat when in danger, and from whence he
can take advantage of a favourable moment of attack upon his
antagonist.</p>

<p>Quail-fighting <em>(áduh gemár)</em> and cock-fighting <em>(áduh
jágu)</em> were formerly very prevalent, the latter particularly,
among the common people, but by no means to the same
extent as practised in the other islands of the Archipelago, in
many parts of which, particularly among the <em>Maláyus</em>, it
forms almost the whole source of diversion and interest. On
the establishment of the British power, cock-fighting and
gaming, which had formerly proved a productive source of
revenue to the European government, were prohibited, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Vol I Pg 390]</a></span>
are now in consequence rarely resorted to. The Javans were
not in the habit of fixing spurs to their cocks: this practice,
they say, belongs to the <em>Maláyus</em><a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. The common people
still amuse themselves with betting upon the issue of a fight
between two crickets (<em>ádhu jangkrik</em>), which are daily exposed
in the markets for that purpose. The little animals
being confined in small <em>bámbus</em> partially opened, are said to
afford an amusement of considerable interest.</p>

<p>Among the games of skill may be reckoned those of chess,
drafts, and several minor games played with pieces or balls,
on boards of a somewhat similar construction.</p>

<p>In chess (<em>chátur</em>) the pieces are named, the <em>rátu</em>, or king;
the <em>pateh</em>, or minister, corresponding with the queen; two
<em>práhu</em>, or vessels, corresponding with castles; two <em>mántri</em>,
corresponding with bishops; two <em>járan</em>, or horses, corresponding
with knights; the <em>bídak</em>, or pawns; and are arranged as
in the English game, except that the kings are placed on the
left hand of the queens, and opposite to the adversary's queen.
The moves are also the same; except that the king, if he has
not been checked, may move two squares the first time, either
as a knight or otherwise; and that the pawn may move two
squares the first move, even though it should pass the check
of an adversary's pawn. When a pawn reach the adversary's
first line, it must retrograde three moves diagonally before it
can become a queen, except it has reached the castle's square,
in which case it is a queen at once. There maybe any number
of queens on the board at once.</p>

<p>The king cannot castle after having been checked. Castling
is performed by two moves; the castle must first be brought
up to the king, after which the king may pass over the castle
at any future move, provided he shall not have been checked,
or that no piece has occupied the square he would move
into. A piece or pawn must remain on the board till the last;
if the king is left alone it is considered as <em>stale mate</em>, and
he wins.</p>

<p>This game was formerly more general than at present.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Vol I Pg 391]</a></span></p>
<p>Besides chess, there are a variety of games played upon
checkers; and next to it in estimation may be considered
the games of <em>chúki</em> and <em>dákon</em>. In <em>chúki</em>, the board has one
hundred and twenty angular points, formed by cross lines on
a checkered board, and the same is played with sixty white
and sixty black pieces. The object here is to clear the board
of the adversary's pieces, and the victor is he who does so
first. The parties toss up who shall take off the first piece or
break the board. The moves are in all directions, and the
person who commences goes on as long as he can take one,
three, or five of his adversary's pieces. When he cannot do
either, he stops, and the other goes on in the same way.
<em>Dákon</em> is played with fourteen or eighteen balls on an oblong
board with holes, and is much practised by women.</p>

<p><em>Dandáman</em>, or drafts, is not very unlike the Indian game,
but has more pieces.</p>

<p><em>Machánan</em>, is a game in which two chief pieces represent
tigers, one conducted by each party, and twenty-three pieces
representing cows: the tiger who destroys the most wins the
game. <em>Máling'an</em> is played on squares with eighteen pieces,
and the object is to surround your adversary's pieces.</p>

<p>Of games of chance there are many. That denominated
<em>telága tári</em> is accounted the most ancient: it consists in guessing
the number of beans enclosed within the hand. Three
or four people commonly join in it. One of the party having
dried beans in his lap, take a certain number in his hand,
requiring each of the others to fix by guess upon a number;
if there are three persons, upon a number from one to four,
and the two numbers left fall to the share of the person who
holds the beans. If the number in his hand exceeds four,
every four beans are thrown aside, and the residue, until they
are reduced to that number or below it, only counted.</p>

<p><em>Dadu</em>, or dice, as well as cards, are borrowed from the
Chinese, and not included among the national games. The
most common species of gaming, and that which is practised
by the numerous and dissolute class of <em>báturs</em>, or porters, in
the central districts, is a kind of pitch and toss, denominated
<em>képlek</em>. Four farthings, whitened or marked on one side, are
tossed into the air; if the whole or three of them fall on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Vol I Pg 392]</a></span>
side that is marked, or on the reverse, the party who tossed
them wins; if only two he loses the stake.</p>

<p>Bets are frequently laid on the hardness or otherwise of a
particular nut, known among the <em>Maláyus</em> by the term <em>búa
kras</em> and called <em>áduh gemíri</em>. Bets also frequently depend
on the flying of kites (<em>layáng'an</em>).</p>

<p>I shall conclude this chapter by referring to some peculiarities,
which, although partially explained elsewhere, and
falling perhaps more correctly under other heads, may not be
improperly noticed in an account of the national usages and
customs.</p>

<p>The practice of filing and dying the teeth black, and that of
lengthening the lobe of the ear to an enormous size, both of
which have been already noticed, appear to have extended
over the whole of the eastern peninsula of India, as far as
China, and throughout the islands of the Archipelago, as far
at least as Papua or New Guinea.</p>

<p>The practice of covering the face, body, and limbs with
yellow powder on state occasions, and the use of yellow silk
or satin for the envelope of letters between princes, evinces the
same esteem for this colour which prevails in the other
islands, as well as in Ava, Siam, and China.</p>

<p>The <em>kríses</em> worn by the Javans are only varieties of that
which is found in the islands, and on what is termed the
Malayan peninsula. The Javans have a tradition that it was
first introduced by one of their early Hindu sovereigns, <em>Sakú-tram</em>
(others call him <em>Sa Pútram</em>), who is said to have come
into the world with the krís by his side. This krís is supposed
to have been of the kind called <em>pasopáti</em>, which is consequently
considered as the most honourable at the present
day. In the chapter on History will be found an account of
the <em>krís</em> deposited in the tomb of the <em>Susúnan Gíri</em>, and of the
virtues attributed to it by the superstitions of the country.
There is a tradition, that the inhabitants of all those countries
in which the <em>krís</em> is now worn, once acknowledged the authority
of the Javans, and derived that custom from them. Another
tradition attributes the introduction of this weapon among
the islanders to the celebrated <em>Pánji</em>. The practice of poisoning
the blade of the <em>krís</em> seems to have been attributed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Vol I Pg 393]</a></span>
Javans and their neighbours without any foundation. In
order to bring out the damasking, it is usual to immerse the
blade in lime juice and a solution of arsenic, which, by eating
away and corroding the iron, may probably render the wound
more angry and inflamed, and consequently more difficult to
cure, but it has never been considered that death is the consequence.
After this application of the acid and arsenic, the
blade is carefully smeared with some fragrant oil, to prevent
it from rusting, and this is all that is ever done to it.</p>

<p>It has been usual to condemn these people as blood-thirsty,
prone to immediate revenge, because they invariably use the
<em>deadly krís</em>; but however frequent the appeals to this weapon
may be in some of the more wild and uncivilized of the Malayan
states, experience has proved to us, that on Java it may
be universally worn without danger. I have elsewhere remarked,
that the custom of wearing the <em>krís</em> among these
islanders has, in its effects upon the manners of the people,
proved in many respects an effectual substitute for duelling
among Europeans. In these countries, where there is very
little justice to be obtained from regularly established courts,
and where an individual considers himself justified in taking
the law into his own hands accordingly, the <em>Maláyu</em> is always
prepared to avenge with his <em>krís</em> the slightest insult on the
spot; but the knowledge that such an immediate appeal is
always at hand, prevents the necessity of its often being resorted
to, an habitual politeness ensues, and it has often been
said, that if the <em>Maláyus</em> are savages, they are by far the most
polite savages that we know of. If this effect is produced on
the wilder and less civilized <em>Maláyu</em>, and has equal force
with the more adventurous and warm-hearted <em>Búgis</em>, it may
be easily conceived the Javans have not escaped it. The <em>krís</em>,
among them, has for a long period been more exclusively a
personal ornament, than a rapier was in Europe fifty years
ago, being among the higher classes even seldomer resorted
to, as a weapon of defence or offence, than the latter.</p>

<p>The condition of absolute slavery, as understood by Europeans,
seems to have been unknown to the ancient constitution
of society in these islands, and throughout all the
fragments of their history, of their laws, usages, and customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Vol I Pg 394]</a></span>
no trace is to be found of its ever having existed among the
Javans<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout the more ancient laws and institutions of the
country, a property of the subject in the land is clearly
recognized, and it is probable that it continued to subsist till
the subversion of the Hindu government. From various
definitions and enactments respecting property, some of which
may be seen in the <em>Súria Alem</em><a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>, it is obvious, that money
transactions took place formerly, to a greater extent than
they do at present. The change is probably attributable to
the European policy of the last two centuries. Four per cent.
per month when a valuable pledge is deposited, and double
that amount otherwise, is the common rate of interest in
small transactions between the natives and Chinese of the
present day.</p>

<p>In the transaction of money concerns, the women are
universally considered superior to the men, and from the
common labourer to the chief of a province, it is usual for
the husband to entrust his pecuniary affairs entirely to his
wife. The women alone attend the markets, and conduct all
the business of buying and selling. It is proverbial to say
the Javan men are fools in money concerns.</p>

<p>When speaking of their fondness for show and state,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Vol I Pg 395]</a></span>I noticed that the Javans were at the same time distinguished
by neatness and cleanliness, qualities not often combined
with the former. That they are in most respects remarkable
for their neatness cannot be denied: to their personal cleanliness
there are exceptions. This is however chiefly true of
the higher classes, and especially those who mix with Europeans;
but the common Javan, though more cleanly than
the Chinese and even the European, would suffer by a comparison
in that particular with the natives of Western India.</p>

<p>The common people generally bathe once a day, others
once only in two or three days. None of any rank anoint the
body with grease, as is the case with the natives of Western
India; but they abundantly oil their hair, which among the
common people, on account of its length, is too often filthy
in the extreme. They are accustomed to arrange the hair
with a coarse comb, but the use of the small-toothed comb is
unknown, its office being invariably performed by the hands
of women. Near Batavia, and some of the low capitals on
the coast, it is not unusual to see on the road side women
thus employed for the benefit of passengers, at a certain rate
per head, who submit to it as naturally as an English labourer
goes into a barber's shop to be shaved for a penny. The
<em>Maláyus</em> accuse the Javans of eating what they find on these
occasions: "<em>ítu órang Jáwa</em>," say they, "<em>mákan kútut</em>."
This, however, appears to be a calumny: the Javans confess
to biting, but deny the swallowing. The practice of the
women cleaning the men's hair is referred to by the Javans
as of very ancient date. It was from this practice that the
mother of <em>Wátu Gúnung</em>, in the very earliest period of Javan
traditionary story, discovered her lost son<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.</p>

<p>Passing from this disgusting particular, and referring the
reader to the details of the native history for the leading
features of the political character of the Javan, and to the
other divisions of this work, which may afford him information
how to estimate their former and present state of civilization,
I cannot but regret, that I am compelled to reserve,
until a future occasion, a more detailed account of the constitution,
usages, and customs of the village societies. It is
by these that the private virtues and vices of the people are
perhaps best illustrated, and an account of the municipal
regulations by which the little property and happiness of
each individual is protected, of the internal precautions of
police, and of the mode of adjusting disputes, could not fail
to be interesting, on account of their simplicity, their equity,
and efficacy. Independently of the degree of rational independence
and importance which the existence of these societies
insures to the common people, and of the protection
which, under all circumstances of greater political revolutions,
they have afforded to them, it is hoped that their influence in
maintaining the police and tranquillity of the country, will
ever prevent the European authority from interfering in their
constitution or internal arrangements.</p>

<p>It has long been the opinion of the Dutch authorities, that
a system of European police, and the employment of European
officers of police are necessary; but under the British
government the contrary has been satisfactorily proved. Let
the higher departments of justice be scrupulously superintended
and watched by Europeans of character; let the administration
of justice be pure, prompt, and steady; let what
is bad in the native practice of police be gradually removed,
but let the system, in its application to the common people,
be supported. It is one which has grown with them, one
which they are accustomed to and understand. Under the
native system, the rice block of the village is used as the
alarm; and according to the manner in which it is beaten,
the inhabitants know whether it is to announce a single thief
or a banditti, a tiger or a fire, and arm themselves suitably.
As it is usual for a thief to have but little covering on his
body, and to oil himself all over, that he may slip from the
hands of any one who may seize him, the Javans make use
of a long wooden pole, with branches of brambles inverted
within a fork at the end, and by means of this simple contrivance
they avoid the risk of being wounded, and effectually
secure the offender, who cannot escape without tearing his
skin. These, and other simple expedients, adopted from
immemorial custom and according to the circumstances of
the country, are certainly preferable to the watchmen's
rattles and constables' staves which Europeans would wish
to introduce.</p>

"They lighted a great number of torches, and the midwife taking up
the child carried it through the yard of the house, and placed it upon a
heap of leaves of sword-grass, close by a basin of water, which was prepared
in the middle of the yard, and then undressing it said, 'my child!

to this dismal and calamitous world: receive this water, which is to
give thee life:' and after wetting its mouth, head, and breast, with forms
similar to the first bathing, she bathed its whole body, and rubbing

<p><a name="Footnote_114_114" id="Footnote_114_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_114_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a> The following are the only traditions respecting these people which
are current in the eastern provinces. "The people of the <em>Teng'ger</em> mountains
say, that they received that name from a person from <em>Matáram</em>, of
an inquisitive and travelling turn (<em>wong malána</em>), who having ascended
the highest of them, and being struck with astonishment at the view of
all around, gave them the above-mentioned name of <em>Teng'ger</em>, from the
Javan word <em>angeng'ger</em>, which signifies wonder or astonishment.
</p>
<p>
"Before <em>Gúnung Bràma</em> had received that name, or had become a volcano,
there lived a man called <em>Kiai Géde Dádap Pútih</em>, who had no children.
He petitioned of his deity to grant that he might have children,
to the number of twenty-five, promising, in that event, that he would
cast away one of them into the sea. In the course of a short time children
began to be born unto him. As soon as he had the number he
had prayed for, the people of <em>Teng'ger</em> were inflicted with a pestilence, so
dreadful in its effects, that those who were attacked by it in the morning
never failed to die before the evening. <em>Dádap Pùtih</em> was so distressed
and afflicted at the lamentable situation of the <em>Teng'ger</em> people, that he
loathed his food and neglected his rest, till it was communicated to him
in a vision, that the pestilence had been sent in consequence of his
having omitted to perform his vow, of casting into the sea one of the
twenty-five children whom the deity had granted him. <em>Dádap Pútih</em>
then assembled all his children, and inquired which of them was willing
to be sacrificed, in order to appease the angry deity. All of them signified
their unwillingness to become the victim except the youngest
child, who voluntarily came forward and agreed to suffer, in which ever
way its father thought proper. <em>Dádap Pútih</em>, however, reflecting that
the sea was at a very great distance, carried this child only to that extensive
sand plain at the foot of <em>Gúnung Bráma</em>, which bears the name of
<em>Sagára wédi</em> or <em>Lout Pásir</em>, and there abandoned it. No sooner had he
done so, than <em>Gúnung Bráma</em> began to send forth hollow sounds, and
immediately burst forth into a volcano. <em>Sagára wédi</em> is so called from
the resemblance of its sandy surface, to a sea when surveyed from <em>Bráma's</em>
heights: its original name is <em>Dassar</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Bima</em> being asked by <em>Kresna</em> if he was able, in the course of one night,
to make an inland sea below the <em>Teng'ger</em> mountains, and having answered
in the affirmative, <em>Kresna</em> challenged him to do it, telling him at
the same time, that it must be done before the cocks were heard to crow,
or the people of the villages began to weave or beat out rice. By three
o'clock in the morning his work was so far advanced, as to convince
<em>Kresna</em> that it would be completed in the prescribed time. To prevent
this, therefore, <em>Kresna</em> immediately went, and rousing all the cocks and
people of the villages, caused the former to crow and the latter to begin
to weave and beat out rice. By this manœuvre, <em>Bima</em> was obliged to
leave off the work, which otherwise would have been completed within
the fixed time; and so incensed was he against the people, who had so
untimely began to weave and beat our their rice (whereby he failed to
perform the task which was given to him to prove his power) that he
cursed them, and swore that they should never again perform either the
one act or the other, and to this day the <em>Teng'ger</em> people neither weave
cotton nor beat out rice."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_116_116" id="Footnote_116_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> It has already been noticed that the island is plentifully supplied with
a fine breed of small horses. Almost every petty chief and public officer is
mounted, and those who possess the means pride themselves upon a respectable
establishment. They have an aversion to some colours, and
there are particular marks, the possession of which renders a horse valuable
to the natives; if a few hairs on the neck curl, or have the appearance
of a star, the horse is highly prized. Previously to the cession of <em>Kedú</em> to
the European government in 1812, the native princes maintained a very
respectable stud in that province. Horses are never shod on Java, nor
are they secured in the stable, as is usual in Europe and Western India. A
separate enclosure is appropriated for each horse, within which the animal
is allowed to move and turn at pleasure, being otherwise unconfined.
These enclosures are erected at a short distance from each other, and with
separate roofs. They are generally raised above the ground, and have a
boarded floor.
</p>
<p>
The Javans use an extremely severe bit, and in consequence have the
horse always under command. The saddle, bridle, &amp;c. are extremely
heavy, and disproportioned to the size of the animal.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_119_119" id="Footnote_119_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_119_119"><span class="label">[119]</span></a> A peculiar feature in the state of society in the Eastern Islands is the
law between debtor and creditor. Throughout the Archipelago, where
the European government has not interfered, confinement for debt is
unknown. The creditor universally has a right to the effects of the debtor,
to the amount of the debt, on proving it before the proper authority, and
if the effects are not sufficient to satisfy the demand, he has a right to the
personal services of his debtor, and of his debtor's wife and children if
necessary. Hence arises that extensive class of people commonly called
slave debtors, or more correctly bondsmen. In Java they are termed
<em>bédol</em>. In the provinces of Java subject to the European authority, this
practice has for some time been checked; and during the administration
of Marshal Daendels, in 1810, when it was usual for the common Javans
to lend themselves in pawn for a certain sum of money, it was declared
illegal. As an ancient institution of the country, it will perhaps be better
explained hereafter, in detailing the existing practice on <em>Báli</em>, which may
be considered to assimilate, in a great measure, with what the practice
once was on Java.</p></div>

<p>The extensive prevalence of the Javan language, and its connexion
with the languages of continental India, were not overlooked
by those intelligent Europeans who visited these
islands at an early period; for we find Valentyn<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> quoting the
authority of Flaccourt, who published in 1661, and the Portuguese
Jan de Barros, for conclusions with regard to the extent
of Javan commerce in remote ages, drawn from the resemblance
then traced between the languages of Java and
those of Madagascar and Ambon (Amboina.) "The Javans,"
observes this author, "must doubtless have visited Coromandel
and Malabar, for the high or court language is, in
three parts out of four, derived from the Sanscrit or Brahminical
language. Many Malabar words also enter into
the composition, and it is besides composed in a great
measure from the <em>Dekan</em>, which is the ancient language of
India, in the same manner as the Sanscrit is the sacred language."</p>

<p>The alphabet has been exhibited, though imperfectly, by
Valentyn, Le Brun, and Reland, and an <em>Alphabetum Bantemense</em>
is said to have been found amongst the posthumous
papers of the learned Hyde; but the language does not appear
to have been regularly cultivated by Europeans until
within the last very few years. Some of the outlines of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Vol I Pg 398]</a></span>e
Javan mythological stories had previously appeared in a
Dutch dress, in the transactions of the Batavian Society; and
these, with the translation of the Lord's Prayer in the high
and low languages, published by Valentyn, some short vocabularies,
and a short comparative view of the Javan and Malayan
languages, which appeared in a Dutch work entitled
"<em>Begin en vortgang den Oost Ind Compen</em>," or the Rise and
Progress of the East-India Company, are the only contributions
to our knowledge of Javan literature with which I am
acquainted.</p>

<p>The native population of Java, <em>Madúra</em>, and <em>Báli</em>, islands
most intimately connected with each other in every respect,
use exactly the same written character, and it appears that
one generic language prevails throughout these islands. Of
this generic language, however, there are four dialects, differing
so materially from each other as to be generally considered
separate languages. It is, however, rather by admixture of
other languages than by mere difference of dialect that they
are distinguished. These dialects or languages are the <em>Súnda</em>,
spoken by the inhabitants of the mountainous districts of Java
west of <em>Tégal</em>; the <em>Jáwa</em> or Javan, which is the general language
of Java east of Chéribon, and throughout the districts
lying on the northern coast of the island; the <em>Madúra</em> and
the <em>Báli</em>, being the dialects or languages belonging to those
islands respectively.</p>

<p>How far these dialects or languages radically assimilate
with each other, and justify the opinion that one generic language
prevails throughout, may be determined by an inspection
of the annexed vocabulary<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>. The <em>Lampung</em> is added on
account of the vicinity of that part of Sumatra to Java, and
the intimate political connection which at all times subsisted
between the people; and in order to enable the reader to compare
them all with the prevailing language of the Archipelago
the <em>Maláyu</em> is prefixed. Under the Javan is included the
<em>Bása kráma</em>, or polite language, which will be more particularly
noticed hereafter.</p>

<p>In this vocabulary such words only have been introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Vol I Pg 399]</a></span>
as are used in conversation, and in ordinary epistolary composition;
but the inhabitants of these islands possess further
a classic language, altogether distinct from the ordinary languages
of the country, and which is to them what the <em>Sanscrit</em>
is to the <em>Pracrit</em> language of Hindustan, and what the Pali
is to the <em>Birman</em> and <em>Siamese</em>. This language is termed
<em>Káwi</em><a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. The annexed vocabulary, No. 2<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>, which affords a
comparison between the <em>Sanscrit</em>, the <em>Pali</em>, and the <em>Káwi</em>,
will shew how nearly these languages are allied.</p>

<p>These two vocabularies may serve to convey a notion of
the extent, peculiarities, and antiquity of the Javan language,
which will be found as intimately connected with the <em>Maláyu</em>,
or general language of the Archipelago, on the one hand, as it
is with the <em>Sanscrit</em> and <em>Pali</em> on the other.</p>

<p>The <em>Súnda</em> language, though now confined to the mountainous
districts, seems to have been formerly, and probably
down to the period immediately preceding the revolution occasioned
by the Mahomedan conversion, the general language
of the western districts, and is perhaps the most ancient vernacular
language of the country. It is a simple uncultivated
dialect, adapted however to all the purposes of the simple and
uneducated mountaineers who speak it, and has perhaps
escaped the influence of foreign innovation, from the peculiar
nature of the country and the independent character of that
race. It possesses a considerable portion of <em>Maláyu</em> words,
and some of Sanscrit origin; the latter being, generally speaking,
proper names or terms of art and science or polity, have
probably been borrowed from the eastern or proper Javans, in
common with whom the <em>Súnda</em> people have adopted a <em>B'hasa
dálam</em>, or <em>Bása kráma</em>, which, however, is by no means extensive.
The <em>Súnda</em>, with reference to the Javan, may be
viewed in much the same light as the Welch is to the English.
The proportion of the people who now speak it does not
exceed one-tenth of the population of the whole island; the
remaining nine-tenths speak Javan.</p>

<p>The language of <em>Madúra</em>, which is again divided into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Vol I Pg 400]</a></span>dialects of <em>Madúra</em> proper and <em>Sumenáp</em>, will be found to
contain many words in common with that of <em>Súnda</em>, but a
much more extensive portion of <em>Maláyu</em>, varied in the termination
by a peculiarity of dialect.</p>

<p>The languages of <em>Báli</em> are intimately connected with those
of Java and <em>Madúra</em>. In the historical part of this work it
will be shewn that it was in <em>Báli</em> the ancient religion, and
with it the literature of Java, took refuge in the fifteenth century
of our æra; and although, from the difference which is
at this day found to exist between the vernacular languages
of the two countries, as well as in their institutions, it is evident
that the language, literature, and institutions of Java
were there engrafted on a more rude and savage stock, still it
is chiefly to <em>Báli</em> that we must look for illustrations of the ancient
state of the Javans. The relation of the political revolutions
by which these islands have been convulsed at different
periods of their history, will, in a great measure, account
for the distinctions of language which at present exist;
while, at the same time, these distinctions and peculiarities
must serve to confirm many of the facts, for which we should
otherwise have only the authority of tradition to rely.</p>

<p>At Bantam the language is much mixed with <em>Maláyu</em> and
<em>Súnda</em>. The language in ordinary use at Batavia and its immediate
vicinity is a jargon of Dutch, Portuguese, Chinese,
Javan, and <em>Maláyu</em>, the latter forming the principal component.
In <em>Bógor</em> and <em>Chai-ánjur</em>, the <em>Súnda</em> is pronounced in
a more drawling manner than in <em>Chéribon</em>, where it is probably
most correctly spoken, as in the word <em>náh</em>, what?
which at Chéribon is pronounced short and sharp, <em>naù</em>. At
<em>Tégal</em> the Javan words are in like manner lengthened in pronunciation,
while at <em>Semárang</em> they are spoken short and
full. At the courts of <em>Sura-kérta</em> and <em>Yugya-kérta</em>, the words
are pronounced short, strong, and full. In the provinces east
of <em>Surabáya</em>, the language partakes much of the <em>Madurese</em>,
and in the extreme district of <em>Banyuwángí</em>, the <em>Báli</em> is discernible.</p>

<p>The alphabet of Java is peculiar: it consists of twenty
consonants (<em>y</em> and <em>w</em> are of the number), termed <em>aksára</em> or
letters. In common with all other characters properly Indian,
these letters may be considered as syllables, composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Vol I Pg 401]</a></span>
of a consonant and an inherent vowel sound, which is invariably
expressed, unless contradicted by a particular sign.</p>

<p>Besides the <em>aksára</em>, there are twenty auxiliary characters,
termed <em>pasáng'an</em>, which in this application means corresponding
or similar. They have the same power as the
<em>aksára</em> against which they stand, except that they are only
used in connexion with and immediately after the <em>aksára</em>, for
the purpose of suppressing their inherent vowel sound.
Three of them are always placed after the <em>aksára</em>, the others
below them.</p>

<p>When the inherent vowel sound in the <em>aksára</em> is not contradicted,
the <em>aksára</em> is termed <em>lagána</em>. The vowel sound in
this case is that of <em>a</em> in "water," or of <em>o</em> in "homo;" the <em>o</em>
being at present invariably used at the native courts and their
vicinity for the inherent vowel of the consonant, instead of <em>a</em>.
The latter, however, is still preserved on <em>Madúra</em>, <em>Báli</em>, and
in the districts of Java, west of <em>Tégal</em>, and was doubtless the
original inherent vowel. The consonant sounds correspond
with the sounds usually attributed to the English consonants,
with the exception of a second <em>d</em> and <em>t</em>, which correspond with
similar sounds in the <em>Devanágari</em> alphabet; <em>ch</em>, which is
used as <em>ch</em> in "church;" <em>nia</em>, and <em>ng'</em>, which latter is frequently
used as an initial letter.</p>

<p>Besides these there are five vowel signs, which supplant
the inherent vowel. These signs are termed <em>sandáng'an</em>, the
clothing or dress. The <em>répa</em> consist of certain contractions
of consonants and other signs used in composition. These,
with a <em>pángkun</em>, or sign of elision, corresponding with the
<em>báris máti</em> of the <em>Malayu</em>, which has no sound of its own,
but being placed at the end of a word or sentence denotes its
termination in a pure consonant, and some few other marks
corresponding with the <em>Devanágari</em>, complete the orthographical
arrangement, which though complex and intricate,
is remarkable for its precision.</p>

<p>Some of the letters occasionally occur under a capital, or
rather peculiar form, for they are of the same size; but these
are seldom used, and when they are, it is not as capitals are
employed in European languages. They are principally
found in proper names, and titles of office, and are placed
alike in the beginning, middle, or end of a word.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Vol I Pg 402]</a></span></p>

<p>The annexed table is intended to exhibit the powers and
application of the different letters and orthographical signs.
No. 1. exhibits the characters now in general use. No. 2.
contains the square characters in which the <em>Káwi</em> is usually
written, and in which the different inscriptions in that language,
cut in stone and copper, are found. No. 3. contains
specimens of the varieties which the alphabetical characters
have at different times assumed, arranged, according to the
judgment of the native writers, in the order of their relative
antiquity.</p>

<p>The Javans write from left to right. Every consonant
(<em>aksára</em>) is written separately, not being joined to that
which precedes it, and no space is left between the words.
One or two short diagonal lines are used at the close of every
poetical stanza, and sometimes a comma, and this is the only
mark in the language which simply indicates a stop.</p>

<p>In Java the natives usually write with Indian ink upon
paper manufactured by themselves, as already described, and
sometimes on European and Chinese paper; but in <em>Báli</em> the
natives invariably use an iron style, and cut the letters on a
prepared palm leaf, in the same manner as in Western India.
This practice is still partially continued in some of the more
eastern parts of Java, and was no doubt, at a former period
of their history, general throughout the island. The leaf is
called <em>lóntar</em> (from <em>ron</em> a leaf, and <em>tal</em> the palm tree, the first
and last letters being transposed), and the leaves or manuscripts
are strung together to form books in the same manner
as on continental India. Of these I have several specimens,
containing nearly all the interesting compositions of the
country.</p>

<p>As in the <em>Maláyu</em>, by far the greater proportion of primitive
Javan words are dissyllables, pronounced with a slight
stress or accent on the former of the two. There are a great
number of derivative words, formed after the same manner as
those in the <em>Maláyu</em>, by prefixing or annexing certain inseparable
and otherwise non-significant particles. Compound
words, formed by the junction of two or more significant
terms, are frequently met with, though they by no means
form an extensive portion of the language.</p>

<p>Many words, in their primitive sense, are not confined to
one particular part of speech, but are common to two or
more. Nouns, as in the <em>Maláyu</em>, cannot be said to possess
the distinctions of either gender, number, or case. The males
and females of all animals are, with few exceptions, as in the
instances <em>Pútra</em>​&mdash;<em>Pútri</em>, <em>Déwa</em>​&mdash;<em>Déwi</em>, <em>Bramána</em>​&mdash;<em>Bramáni</em>,
and some few others, denoted by adding to the general terms
words applicable to the different sexes. Number is not
denoted by any variety of termination or change in the form
of the noun, but by separate words, expressive of plurality or
singularity; a duplication of the singular sometimes occurs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Vol I Pg 407]</a></span>
though rarely, to denote plurality. Where the terms <em>bíji</em>,
<em>ékor</em>, <em>buáh</em>, <em>képing</em>, &amp;c. are used in the <em>Maláyu</em> to specify a
particular number, the term <em>wíji</em> is used indiscriminately in
the Javan, whatever may be the thing spoken of. The nouns
have no cases.</p>

<p>The adjectives are indeclinable, and generally follow the
noun; and these are sometimes formed from nouns by prefixing
a particle. The comparative degree is sometimes
formed by prefixing a word meaning higher or larger, but
more frequently by placing adverbs, significant of "with,"
before that with which the comparison is made, as if we
should say "by the side of." The superlative degree is
formed by annexing adverbs signifying "very, exceedingly,
entirely, alone."</p>

<p>The cardinal numbers are placed sometimes before and
sometimes after the nouns to which they are attached. When
prefixed, they undergo, for the sake of the sound, a variety in
their termination, or drop the first syllable. The ordinals are
formed by prefixing a distinguishing word to the cardinals.
Ten characters, which are all either alphabetical letters or
signs slightly altered in form, serve to express all numbers,
the notation being decimal, and the numerals being combined
in the same manner as the Indian and Arabian.</p>

<p>The pronouns of the first and second person are always
significant, and vary with the relative rank of the parties.
There is no proper pronoun of the third person, but a word
signifying "alone, self," with the addition of the possessive
particle, is used as a personal pronoun of the third person.
The personal pronouns may all be used as possessive pronouns,
by being placed as such after the noun to which they
belong. The relative and demonstrative pronouns correspond
very nearly with those of the <em>Maláyu</em>.</p>

<p>With regard to the verb, it may be noticed that many of
the observations in Mr. Marsden's grammar, on the nature
and formation of the different parts of the <em>Maláyu</em> verb, are
applicable to the Javan. It belongs rather to the detail of
the grammar to point out these; but it may be remarked, that
the use of these inflexions in the Javan appears to be so
varied and undefined, that it is impossible, without a much
more extensive knowledge of the language than Europeans at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Vol I Pg 408]</a></span>
present possess, to make out a perfect conjugation, or to lay
down any fixed rules for them. All that could perhaps be
done, in the present state of the language and of our knowledge
of it, would be to give a number and variety of correct
idiomatical expressions in the Javan, by which their nature
and irregularity may be shewn; and our present limits do not
admit of this.</p>

<p>The Javan language has never been reduced within the
grammatical rules adopted by Europeans, nor have the
Javans themselves any notion of grammar. The construction
is generally simple and regular; but owing to prosodial
refinements (every writing of importance being written in
verse), syllables and words necessary to express a perfect
sense are often omitted; at other times, unnecessary syllables
or words are added, and letters at the beginning, middle, and
end of a word are transposed. Hence, and also from the
usual ellipsis of the verb transitive and personal pronouns, the
meaning of many passages appears obscure.</p>

<p>The language is remarkable for the profusion of words
which it contains, for the minute distinctions and shades of
meaning, and the consequent extent of synonymes, and for
difference of dialect.</p>

<p>Of the profusion of words it may be observed, that the
Javan, in this respect, may be put in competition with many of
the more cultivated languages of Europe and Asia, and that a
dictionary would perhaps be far from complete, if it comprehended
less than twenty thousand.</p>

<p>Of the extent of synonymes, and the minute shades of distinction
which are found in this language, some notion may
be formed from the extracts from the <em>Dása Náma</em> which are
annexed<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>. In order to facilitate the acquirement of the language,
it is usual to collect all the words in the different
dialects, with their synonymes, and to connect them together
by stringing them in classes following each other, according
to the natural chain of our ideas. Thus, after commencing
with the word <em>man</em>, and giving an explanation of every word
in the vernacular, polite and <em>Káwi</em> languages, applicable from
his birth to his death, as <em>infant</em>, <em>boy</em>, <em>youth</em>, and the like, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Vol I Pg 409]</a></span>proceeds to <em>woman</em>, <em>child</em>; from thence to the deities, afterwards
to the various avocations of mankind, &amp;c. This
collection of synonymes is called <em>Dása Náma</em>, literally
the "ten names," a term probably given to it on account of
few important words in the language having less than ten synonymes.
Children are no sooner taught to know the letters
of the alphabet (which they first describe on the sand), and
to connect them in syllables and words, than they are instructed
in the <em>Dása Náma</em>, without a partial knowledge of
which, no youth is considered competent to enter upon any
public office, or can advance to a knowledge of the written
compositions of the country. These collections are varied in
their contents and order of arrangement, according to the acquirements
and notions of the compiler. As books of reference
they may be considered to supply the place of dictionaries,
and if less convenient for this purpose than works alphabetically
arranged, they have certainty an advantage over them,
in the comparative facility with which their contents are impressed
on the memory.</p>

<p>But there is no feature in the language more deserving of
notice than the difference of dialect, or the distinction between
the common language, and what may be termed the
polite language or language of honour. The latter contains
many words of Sanscrit origin, and a portion of <em>Maláyu</em>; and
in those instances in which it appears to have been borrowed
from the vernacular language, which may perhaps be loosely
estimated at a fourth of the whole, a slight alteration is commonly
made in the orthography and pronunciation, to mark
the distinction. To render this distinction intelligible to
those who are not locally informed, it may be necessary to
explain, that from whatever cause the distinction may have
originated, so clearly is the line drawn on Java, between the
higher and the lower classes of society, that on no account is
any one, of whatever rank, allowed to address his superior in
the common or vernacular language of the country. This language
is exclusively applied when addressing an inferior, or
among the lower orders or uneducated, where distinction of
rank may not be acknowledged. Persons of high and equal
rank, when discoursing among themselves, sometimes use the
polite language, but in general they adopt a medium, by intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Vol I Pg 410]</a></span>ducing
words belonging to both branches of the language;
and this is generally adopted by them in epistolary correspondence.</p>

<p>It is probable, that in the earlier stages of society, the
terms of respect used towards a superior were comparatively
few: that this second dialect, which now forms so extensive
a branch of the general language, has been gradually formed
with the growth of arbitrary power; and that, at one period,
the extent of these terms did not exceed what is to be at this
day found in the less cultivated dialects, and among the more
independent races of <em>Madúra</em> and <em>Súnda</em>. Such, however, is
their present extent in the Javan, that nearly one half of the
words in the vernacular language, have their corresponding
term in the <em>Bása Kráma</em> or polite language, without a knowledge
of which no one dare address a superior; and although
the general construction of the language, and its grammatical
principles are not altered, so effectually is the language of inferiority
contrasted with that of superiority, that it is possible
to suppose a case in which a person might be well acquainted
with one dialect, without being able to understand one sentence
of the other.</p>

<p>It is not, however, to be inferred, that the one is studied
and attained exclusively of the other, for while the one is the
language of address, the other must be that of reply, and the
knowledge of both is indispensable to those who have to communicate
with persons of a different rank with themselves.
Children are accustomed from their infancy to employ the
polite language in addressing their parents and relations, and
this added to the mode of instruction by the <em>Dása Náma</em>
above described, early impresses upon their memory the corresponding
terms to be used according to the occasion. The
<em>Bása Kráma</em>, as has been before noticed, consists of a more
extensive class of foreign words, and where different words
from the common language have not been introduced, a variation
in the orthography and termination is adopted; and the
more effectually to render it distinct, not only are the affirmatives
and negatives, as well as the pronouns and prepositions
varied, but the auxiliary verbs and particles are different.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned, that besides the ordinary and
the polite languages of the country, the inhabitants of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Vol I Pg 411]</a></span>
Islands possess a poetic or classic language, called <em>Káwi</em>. In
this are written all the historical and poetical compositions of
note, as well as most of the ancient inscriptions on stone and
copper, which are found in different parts of the Island. In
a short vocabulary already referred to<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>, the relation of the
<em>Káwi</em> to the Sánscrit and <em>Páli</em> is shewn; and in order to
enable the Sánscrit scholar to extend the comparison, I have
annexed a further vocabulary of <em>Káwi</em> words, with the meaning
which the Javans at present attach to them<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>.</p>

<p>At what period this language was introduced into Java,
whence it came, and whether it was ever the sacred or vernacular
language of any foreign people, remains to be decided.
Of the words of which it is composed, as far as we
may judge from the annexed vocabulary, and the compositions
which have come down to us, nine out of ten are of
Sánscrit origin, and less corrupted than the present <em>Páli</em> of
<em>Siam</em> and <em>Ava</em> appears to be: if, therefore, it was ever the
same language with the <em>Páli</em>, it must have been before the
<em>Páli</em> was corrupted, and therefore probably at a very remote
period.</p>

<p>In <em>Báli</em> the <em>Káwi</em> is still the language of religion and law;
in Java it is only that of poetry and ancient fable. In the
former, the knowledge of it is almost exclusively confined to
the <em>Bramána</em> (Bramins); in the latter, a slight knowledge of
it is deemed essential for every man of condition. In <em>Báli</em>,
the ancient, mythological, and historical poems, are however
preserved in more correct <em>Káwi</em> than on Java: and it is to
the copies obtained from thence, that reference will be principally
made in the observations which follow on Javan literature.</p>

<p>In noticing "the accessary tongues from whence the <em>Maláyan</em>
acquired such a degree of improvement, as removed
it from the general level of the other cognate dialects, and
gave it a decided predominance in that part of the east,"
Mr. Marsden observes, "that the earliest, as well as most
important of these, appears to have been, either directly or
mediately, that great parent of Indian languages, the <em>Sanscrit</em>,
whose influence is found to have pervaded the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Vol I Pg 412]</a></span>of the eastern (and perhaps also of the western) world, modifying
and regenerating even where it did not create. That
the intercourse, whatever its circumstances may have been,
which produced this advantageous effect, must have taken
place at an early period, is to be inferred, not only from the
deep obscurity in which it is involved, but also from the
nature of the terms borrowed, being such as the progress of
civilization must soon have rendered necessary, expressing
the feelings of the mind, the most obvious moral ideas, the
simplest objects of the understanding, and those ordinary
modes of thought which result from the social habits of
mankind; whilst, at the same time, it is not to be understood,
as some have presumed to be the case, that the
affinity between these languages is radical, or that the
latter is indebted to any Hindu dialect for its names for the
common objects of sense<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>."</p>

<p>The same observations apply still more extensively to the
Javan; and in the <em>Káwi</em> or classic language, we may presume
to have discovered the channel by which the Javan received
its principal store of Sanscrit words, for it is the practice,
even at present, among the better educated of the Javans,
for the party to display his reading, by the introduction, particularly
into epistolary correspondence and literary compositions,
of <em>Káwi</em> words, by which means the colloquial, but
more particularly the written language of the country, is daily
receiving fresh accessions of Sanscrit terms. From the vocabularies
now presented to the public, and the account which
will be given of their literary compositions, it will appear, that
few languages, even on the continent of India, have been more
indebted to the Sanscrit than the Javan. One original language
seems, in a very remote period, to have pervaded the
whole Archipelago, and to have spread (perhaps with the
population) towards Madagascar on one side, and to the
islands in the South Sea on the other; but in the proportion
that we find any of these tribes more highly advanced in the
arts of civilized life than others, in nearly the same proportion
do we find the language enriched by a corresponding accession
of Sanscrit terms, directing us at once to the source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Vol I Pg 413]</a></span>
whence civilization flowed towards these regions. At what
period, however, the light first broke in upon them, or at
what period the intercourse first took place between the enlightened
inhabitants of Western Asia and the islanders of
this extensive Archipelago, is a question which, perhaps, may
be more properly discussed, when treating of the antiquities
and history of the country, and at best is involved in so much
obscurity and fable, that much must be left to conjecture.</p>

<p>The letters of the Javan alphabet, as well as the orthographical
signs, are decidedly on the principle of the <em>Devanágari</em>;
but it is remarkable, that the letters of the alphabet do
not follow the same order, notwithstanding that order is preserved
in all the alphabets of Sumatra as well as in that of
Celebes. This deviation has been considered presumptive of
the alphabet having been introduced into the island anterior
to the period when this order might have been established for
the <em>Devanágari</em> itself, or before the refinement supposed to
have been effected in that alphabet by the Bramins; but the
deviation may, perhaps, be sufficiently accounted for, by the
circumstance of a meaning being attached to the words
formed by the order of the Javan alphabet as the letters are at
present arranged, thus: <em>hána charáka dáta sawála páda
jayánia mága batáng'a</em>; means, "there were two messengers
disputing with each other, equally courageous, till they both
died<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>." That this is not accidental may be inferred, not
only from the common laws of chance, but from the probability
of such an arrangement being preferred, both on account
of its convenience, and in conformity with the spirit which in
the <em>Chándra Sangkála</em> seeks to select such expressions for
the particular numerals that are required, as may make a
sentence.</p>

<p>Near the ruins of <em>Brambánan</em> and <em>Sínga-sári</em>, are still found
inscriptions in the pure <em>Devánágari</em> character of a very ancient
form. A specimen of these, together with one of the
square <em>Káwi</em>, is exhibited in the accompanying plate, corresponding
in size with the original. Annexed to each letter in
the <em>Devanágari</em> character found on Java, is the modern character,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Vol I Pg 414]</a></span>
and in the same manner the modern Javan letters are
placed under the <em>Káwi</em>; and, in order to enable the reader to
compare the forms of the consonants used in the alphabets of
Ava, Siam, and Java, with the <em>Devanágari</em>, they have been
placed against each other in another plate. It will be seen
that many of the letters of the <em>Káwi</em> correspond so exactly
with the square <em>Páli</em> of the Birmans, as to leave no doubt of
their having originally been the same. It is probable, also,
that were our acquaintance with the <em>Páli</em> more extensive, a
similar coincidence would be found between the languages.</p>

<p>Upon the overthrow of the Hindu empire on Java, the natives
may be considered to have lost most of their knowledge of
the <em>Káwi</em> language; for although numerous compositions in it
are still to be found among them, and these compositions are
recited in their national entertainments, they would not be
generally understood, but for the versions which have long
since been rendered of them into the modern Javan. The
<em>Panambakán</em> of <em>Sumenap</em> is perhaps, at present, alone entitled
to be considered as a <em>Káwi</em> scholar, and he knows so
little of the language as to acknowledge, while assisting in
translating from it, that he was often under the necessity of
guessing at the meaning.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the ancient characters seems, on Java, to
have been for many years almost exclusively confined to the
family of this chief, and it is stated, that they owe their knowledge
of it, and of the <em>Káwi</em> language itself, to the circumstance
of one of them having visited <em>Báli</em>, to which island
it is that we must now look as the chief depositary of what
remains of the literature and science which once existed on
Java.</p>

<p>It is not unusual for the Javans, in carrying on any secret
or political correspondence, to adopt a mystical language,
known only to the parties themselves; and on occasions where
attempts have been made to stir up the common people to
commotion, scrolls have been distributed in various unintelligible
characters, which, for the most part, appear to have had
no other object but to impose on the credulity of those who
were too willing to believe them sacred and mysterious. Were
the characters intelligible, the mystery would cease, and the
charm be dispelled. Of the manner in which the letters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Vol I Pg 415]</a></span>
alphabet are applied in forming this mystical language, an
instance is given at the conclusion of the vocabulary of <em>Káwi</em>
words<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike the Malayan, the Javan language owes little or nothing
to the Arabic, except a few terms connected with
government, religion, and science, which have been admitted
with the religion and laws of Mahomet. The language, as
well as the ancient institutions of the country, have been but
little affected by the conversion. The Javan language was
abundantly copious before the introduction of Arabic literature,
and had few or no deficiencies to be supplied.</p>

<p>The general character of the language is strongly indicative
of a former advanced state of civilization, and illustrates, in
some degree, the present character of the people. It is rich
and refined; it abounds in synonymes and nice distinctions; it
is mixed and easily made to bend, and suit itself to every
occasion; it is, in a high degree, expressive of power and
servility<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>.</p>

<p>As the languages of the whole Archipelago are so intimately
connected with each other, and that of Celebes in particular
is so little known, I have subjoined in an Appendix some further
comparative vocabularies of the languages of Java, with
some observations on the <em>Búgis</em> and <em>Mangkásar</em> nations<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>For ordinary purposes, the Javans, as already described,
use a modification of some of the letters of their alphabet as
numerals, and a representation of these numerals has been
given in the table of the Javan alphabet, page <a href="#Page_404">404</a>; but on
occasions of importance, it is usual to employ certain signs or
symbols in lieu of these ordinary numerals, and this practice
appears to be of great antiquity among them. These symbols
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Vol I Pg 416]</a></span>are termed <em>chándra sangkála</em>, "reflections of royal times," or
"the light of royal dates," and consist in a certain number
of objects, &amp;c. either represented in design or named, each of
which is significant of one of the ten numerals. Of the former
class are said to be those found in most of the ancient buildings
and coins, which in that case usually bear no inscription.
The latter is found in most of the ancient inscriptions, and in
such of the written compositions as possess any date at all, and
is adopted in all proclamations and public writings by the sovereign
of the present day.</p>

<p>The Appendix G. contains an account of these peculiar numerals,
as far as they are at present understood by the
Javans. In the use of them, they endeavour to select such
objects from the list, as when read in succession, may afford
some meaning illustrative of the fact the date of which is
recorded; but this is not always attended to, or at least is not
always to be traced. The date of the destruction of <em>Majapàhit</em>
(1400), the most important in the history of Java, is stated as
follows, the numbers being always reversed.</p>

<p>Other examples will be given, in detailing some of the
principal events of Javan history.</p>

<p>However imperfect the foregoing general account of the
languages of Java may be, it will have served to convey to the
reader some notion of the extent to which it has been indebted
to a foreign source for its copiousness and refinement,
and to prepare him for that extensive influence of Hindu
literature, which is still to be found in the compositions of
the country. Of these the most important, and indeed all
that have any claim to literary distinction, are found either in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Vol I Pg 417]</a></span>
the <em>Káwi</em> or in Javan versions from that classic language.
On Java the establishment of a Mahomedan government for
nearly four centuries, has tended in a great measure to obliterate
that general knowledge among the better educated,
which, there is reason to believe, once existed; but in <em>Báli</em>,
the Hindu faith, however blended with the local customs of
the island, and however perverted and distorted in its application
by a semi barbarous people, is still the established religion
of the country. Mahomedanism has gained but little
ground there, and no part of the island has yet submitted to
European authority. It was in this conveniently situated
island that the adherents to that faith took refuge, when the
sword of Mahomed prevailed on Java, carrying with them such
remnants of the sciences and literature as they were able to
rescue from the general wreck.</p>

<p>An account of the present state of the island of <em>Báli</em>, of
the religious and political institutions, and of some of the
peculiar customs and usages which subsist there, is essential
to the illustration of Javan history; and although the limits
of the present volume will not admit of our enlarging so
much on this interesting subject as we could wish, it is hoped
that a general notion may be formed, from the particulars
which will be inserted in the chapter on the religion and
antiquities of Java. In the following account of the literary
compositions of Java, I shall avail myself of the more correct
copies, which I was fortunate enough to obtain from <em>Báli</em>,
confining myself in the explanation of them to the existing
notions of the best informed of the Javans, it being the present
state of their literature, rather than that of <em>Báli</em>, that
I am now to describe.</p>

<p>The literature of Java may be considered under the general
heads of ancient and modern, the former and more important
division consisting of compositions in the <em>Káwi</em> language,
which appear connected with the mythology and fabulous
history of continental India.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted, that the work which treats most
extensively of the ancient mythology of the country, and of
the earliest periods of fabulous history to which the Javans
of the present day refer, is not to be found in the <em>Káwi</em>.
The Javan work, termed <em>Kánda</em>, is probably a translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Vol I Pg 418]</a></span>
from the <em>Káwi</em>, and, in the absence of the original, claims
our first attention. It is to this work, and the <em>Mánek Móyo</em>,
of which an abstract will be given in the chapter on religion,
that the modern Javans constantly refer for an explanation of
their ancient mythology.</p>

<p>This composition is frequently called <em>Pepákam</em>. It contains
the notions of mythology which appear to have been
general throughout the Eastern Islands, with imperfect portions
of their astronomical divisions, and of ancient history.
It is to be regretted, however, that the Javan copy from which
the following account is taken, though otherwise written in a
very correct style, abounds in passages unfit for a chaste ear,
and that it has been almost impossible entirely to purify it.</p>

<p>It opens with an account, first of <em>Sáng yáng Wénang</em> (the
most powerful), who was sixth in descent from <em>Purwáning
Jan</em> (the first of men, or Adam), and who had a son named
<em>Sáng yáng Túng'gal</em> (the great and only one), the first, who
(as is inferred from the meaning of his name) conceived that
he was above all, and who setting aside the ways of his
father, established the heavens, with all that they contain,
under the name of <em>Suréndra Buána</em>, or <em>Suraláya</em>.</p>

<p>Plucking a leaf from the <em>kastúba</em> tree, and paying adoration
to it, the leaf assumed the form of a beautiful woman, by
whom he had four sons:​&mdash;1, <em>Sáng yáng Púgu</em>; 2, <em>Sáng yáng
Púng'gung</em>; 3, <em>Sáng yáng Sámba</em>; 4, <em>Sáng yáng Pang'at</em>.
When these children attained maturity, <em>Púgu</em> quarrelled
with <em>Púng'gung</em>, on account of the splendour and riches of
the dwelling of <em>Sáng yáng Túng'gal</em>, which each of them
desired to possess. <em>Sáng yáng Túng'gal</em> became enraged at
this: not being able to reconcile them, the heavens became
disturbed; he, in consequence, seized hold of both of them,
<em>Púgu</em> by the right and <em>Púng'gung</em> by the left hand, and cast
them aside. To the former, who fell on <em>Sábrang</em> (the opposite
coast), he gave the name of <em>Sécha Túng'gára</em>; to the latter,
who fell on Java, he gave that of <em>Náyan-taka</em> (the same with
<em>Sémar</em>, the attendant on <em>Arjúna</em>). He converted them into
monstrous figures, ridiculous in appearance and speech,
exciting laughter by their actions, and with an inclination to
follow in attendance on warriors.</p>

<p><em>Sáng yáng Tung'gal</em>, who is said to have been invisible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Vol I Pg 419]</a></span>
and who in the <em>Wáyangs</em> of the present day is designated by
a sun or glory of light, transferred the government of heaven
to his son, <em>Sáng yáng Sámba</em>, directing him not to separate
from his remaining brother, whose assistance he would require,
and conferring upon him the title of <em>Níla Kánta</em> (blue necked),
on account of his being of bright appearance, but having a
tinge of blue on the front of his throat. To <em>Pang'at</em>, his
brother, he gave the name of <em>Kaníka pútra</em>.</p>

<p><em>Srí Níla Kánta</em> subsequently assumed various names and
titles; the most pre-eminent of which was <em>Pramésti Gúru</em>,
by which name and title he is acknowledged as supreme
throughout the Eastern Islands. This title was first conferred
upon him when the deities in <em>Saraláya</em> were numerous, and
when all looked up to him as an instructor or <em>Gúru</em>. <em>Kaníka
Pútra</em> took the name of <em>Rési Naráda</em>.</p>

<p>The thoughts of <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> turning one day upon
women, he took a leaf of the <em>kastúba</em> tree, and paying adoration
to it, it was immediately converted into a most beautiful
female, who took the name of <em>Uma</em>. While she was young
he looked upon her as a daughter, but when she arrived at
maturity, he felt a stronger passion. <em>Uma</em> disliking this fled,
and <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> being unable to catch her, it occurred
to him that he might be more successful if he employed four
hands and arms; whereupon, at his desire, two additional
arms sprang from his shoulders, and <em>Uma</em> was immediately
within his embrace. But she still resisted his desires, and
during the struggle <em>Káma Sála</em> and <em>Máha Praláya</em>, both
<em>Rasáksas</em>, but the latter in the form of a man, were produced,
by an event similar to that which gave birth to some of the
children of Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>. <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> still observing the
repulsive conduct of <em>Uma</em>, said to her, "your appearance is
like that of a <em>Rasáksa</em>," whereupon she immediately assumed
the form of one; and grieving sorely at this transformation,
beseeched that she might again become what she had been,
but <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> was deaf to her entreaties, and he conferred
upon her the name of <em>Káli Dúrga</em>.</p>

<p><em>Káma Sála</em> and <em>Máha Praláya</em>, when they arrived at
maturity, mutually sought from each other to discover their
descent, but not succeeding, they agreed to proceed in company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Vol I Pg 420]</a></span>
to Suraláya, to demand information from <em>Sáng yáng
Gúru</em>, resolving that, if they were not satisfied with his reply,
they would make war against him. Arrived at <em>Suraláya</em>,
they overcome the opposition of <em>Rési Naráda</em>, and reach the
presence of <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em>, who informs them that they
are not his children, though they sprang from his body, and
that it was the fault of the woman only that they had their
present form. He tells them that he cannot allow them to
remain in <em>Suraláya</em>, but will provide for them a place in
which with their mother they may reside. He then appoints
the mother to be sovereign of <em>Naráka (Tambráka múka</em>),
under the title of <em>Yáma Dipáti</em>. To <em>Káma Sála</em> he gives
the title of <em>Batára Kála</em>; the other retained the name of
<em>Máha Praláya</em>. To <em>Kála</em> he assigns the charge of the bridge
between earth and heaven, called <em>Wot ágal ágil</em> (the tremulous
or swinging bridge, over which a good man may pass
in safety, but from which, on account of its being shaken by
his sins, a bad man falls into the gulph below), and to <em>Máha
Praláya</em> that of the souls of men when they die, in order
that he may direct to the bridge such as, from good conduct
on earth, have a chance of passing it, and cast the others
into <em>Naráka</em>, to his mother <em>Yáma Dipáti</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> was again inclined to take another leaf
of the <em>kastúba</em> tree, but apprehending that it might turn out
as before, he restrained his inclination. Then purifying himself,
there appeared before him, at his desire, a beautiful boy,
to whom he gave the name of <em>Sámbu</em>, and after five more
purifications, there successively appeared, secondly, a boy of
a high colour, beautiful and very powerful, to whom he gave
the name of <em>Bráma</em>; thirdly, a boy, appearing extremely
powerful and enraged, to whom he gave the name of <em>Máha
déwa</em>; fourthly, a boy beautifully white, bright, and fierce
looking, and having sharp and sparkling eyes, to whom
he gave the name of <em>Basúki</em>; fifthly, a boy of a deep black
colour, but extremely beautiful, to whom he gave the name
of <em>Wísnu</em> (Vishnu); sixthly, a girl of a bright yellow colour,
beautiful and slender, to whom he gave the name of <em>Warsíki</em>.</p>

<p><em>Rési Naráda</em><a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> following the example of his superior, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Vol I Pg 421]</a></span>appeared before him after several purifications, five boys.
The first was brilliant and bright as a pure flame; on him
<em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> conferred the name of <em>Súria</em>. The second
was very weak and delicate, but well formed and beautiful;
he received the name of <em>In dra</em>. The third was short and
strong, and was named <em>Sákra</em> (or <em>Chákra</em>). The fourth was
of a blue colour, and looking as if he would grow to a great
height, with curled hair like a <em>Papúa</em><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>; on him, was conferred
the name of <em>Báyu</em>. The fifth was most beautiful, but
appeared sad and sorrowful; to him <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> gave
the name of <em>Chándra</em>.</p>

<p>This effected, <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> considered that a sufficient
number of deities had been created for the charge of <em>Suraláya</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> then turned his amorous thoughts towards
<em>Warsíki</em>, but all the deities opposing it, <em>Rési Naráda</em> advises
him to take a woman from the earth, and offers himself to go
in search of one. This being agreed to, <em>Naráda</em> descends
upon the earth, and discovers a most beautiful virgin, not yet
arrived at maturity, at a place called <em>Mádang</em>; <em>Sáng yáng
Gúru</em> no sooner beheld her than he became enamoured of her,
and giving the name of <em>Sri</em>, he places her under the charge
of <em>Batára Sákra</em>, with especial injunctions to take care of
her. When she arrived at maturity she became most beautiful,
and it so happens that <em>Batára Wísnu</em> beholds her by
accident: they immediately feel a mutual passion, and <em>Wísnu</em>
obtains his desire. When <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> hears of it, he
becomes highly enraged; <em>Batára Wísnu</em> is cast out from
<em>Suraláya</em> and thrown upon the earth, at a place called <em>Waríngen
pítu</em>, or seven banyan trees.</p>

<p>[Here the narrative breaks off, and the story of <em>Wátu
Gúnung</em> commences as follows.]</p>

<p>There was a woman of the name of <em>Sínta</em>, who resided on
the earth, and who had a younger sister named <em>Lándap</em>.
<em>Sínta</em> dreamt one night that she was sleeping with a <em>Pandíta</em>,
named <em>Rési Gána</em>: after a few months she felt herself pregnant,
and at the expiration of nine she was delivered of
a most beautiful boy. This child, however, soon became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Vol I Pg 422]</a></span>
unruly; and it happened that one day, when he had enraged
his mother excessively, she struck him on the head with the
wooden spoon which was in the rice vessel, on which he fled
into the woods, and afterwards becoming a devotee, his
mother long searched for him in vain.</p>

<p>At length having concluded his penance, he wandered
about in quest of subsistence, until he came to the country of
<em>Gíling Wési</em>, where he sought alms at a feast; but not being
satisfied with the provision afforded to him, the parties
became enraged, and hostilities ensuing, the Raja of the
country was slain, and this boy succeeded him, under the
title of <em>Rája Séla Perwáta</em>, which in the common language
is the same as <em>Wátu Gúnung</em>, a name conferred upon him
from his having rested on a mountain like a stone, and
obtained his strength and power thereby, without other aid or
assistance.</p>

<p>Becoming a great and powerful sovereign, he was still
unmarried when his mother and sister arrived in the country.
Ignorant who they were, and admiring their beauty, he
espoused them both, and by his mother <em>Sínta</em> had twenty-seven
children, when being one day restless and anxious to
sleep, he requested her to comb and scratch his head, in doing
which she discovered the wound and recognized her son.
Her grief became excessive, and explaining the circumstance
to him, she urged him to obtain another wife from among the
<em>Widadári</em> of <em>Suraláya</em>, and recommended <em>Sri</em> as a proper
object of his choice.</p>

<p><em>Wátu Gúnung</em> thereupon sent an embassy to <em>Suraláya</em>,
but the gods opposing his desires, because <em>Sri</em> had been
delivered of a child by <em>Wísnu</em>, he assembled his forces and
nearly defeated those of <em>Suraláya</em>, when <em>Naráda</em> pointing
out the danger to <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em>, urged the advantage that
would arise from the recal of <em>Wisnu</em>. <em>Naráda</em> was accordingly
authorized to call him back, with a promise that if he
should be victorious on the present occasion, he should be
pardoned, and permitted to return to his former abode in
<em>Suraláya</em>. <em>Wísnu</em> was no sooner engaged in the cause, than
he formed a stratagem with <em>Wilúwuh</em>, a demon <em>Rasáksa</em>,
with whom he had become intimate at <em>Waríngen pítu</em>, and
directed him to proceed to the sleeping place of <em>Wítu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Vol I Pg 423]</a></span>
Gúnung</em>, in order to ascertain his secret. This spy had no
sooner concealed himself in a place where he could overhear
the conversation that was going on, than he heard the following
discourse between <em>Wátu Gúnung</em> and <em>Sínta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sínta.</em> "What think you; shall we be successful or not in
this enterprise?"</p>

<p><em>Wátu Gúnung.</em> "If the gods are so nearly destroyed by
those who are subordinate to me, what must they not suffer
when I go myself? for I shall not then have occasion to
use force. I need only say a few words, and if they don't
understand the meaning of them, they will forthwith be
destroyed, and I shall myself become sovereign of <em>Suraláya</em>.
Should they, however, comprehend the meaning
of what I say, then I shall know that my power is gone;
but still there will be trouble in putting me to death."</p>

<p><em>Sínta.</em> "Tell me what are the words you mean to use, and
why they have not the power to put you to death?"</p>

<p><em>Wátu Gúnung.</em> "I shall enclose in my hand the <em>Sástra</em>
or description of my country, and holding it out, demand
of them to tell me what it is. Then I shall repeat these
words: <em>dáka wói díki</em>, and also <em>díki wói dáka</em>. The
meaning of these words is easy enough, but the gods don't
understand it: a great tree has small fruit; great fruit has a
small tree. The great tree with small fruit means the
<em>waríngin</em> tree; the great fruit and small tree means the
gourd. I am invulnerable by all weapons, but if they pull
my two arms asunder, then will they find it easy to put me
to death; but this the gods know not."</p>

<p>With this intelligence the spy immediately hastened to
<em>Wísnu</em>, who arrived at <em>Suraláya</em> when the gods were nearly
beaten by the twenty-seven sons of <em>Wátu Gúnung</em>. After
this success, <em>Wátu Gúnung</em> approaching <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em>,
put the intended questions to him. The latter referring to
<em>Wísnu</em>, they were immediately recognized by him, on which
<em>Wátu Gúnung</em> attempted to escape, but was soon overtaken
by <em>Wísnu</em>, who laying hold of one of his arms, while his son,
<em>Sri Gáti</em>, held the other, they soon succeeded in putting him to
death. As he expired a voice was heard by <em>Wísnu</em>, saying,
"think not that it will end here: hereafter trouble will again
arise in <em>Suraláya</em>, in the time of <em>Rája Sumáli</em>, of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Vol I Pg 424]</a></span>
of <em>Séla gríng'ging</em>, who will have a brother named <em>Mang'liáwan</em>.
Forget it not."</p>

<p>When the twenty-seven sons of <em>Wátu Gúnung</em> heard of
their father's fate, they wished to sacrifice themselves; but
<em>Wísnu</em> disposed of them as follows, saying, "let there be a
sign to the world of this victory. I will once in seven days
put to death one of these twenty-seven, so that they may
be killed in rotation." The grief of <em>Sínta</em> being excessive,
she wept for seven days, and afterwards was received into
<em>Suraláya</em>, and <em>Wísnu</em> added her name, as well as those
of her sister and <em>Wátu Gúnung</em>, to the twenty-seven, and
established the thirty <em>wúku</em>, as everlasting signs, in commemoration
of this victory. From the grief of <em>Sínta</em> for seven
days, it is said that rain always falls during the <em>wúku</em> which
bears her name<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>.</p>

<p>Then seizing the <em>Pepáteh</em> and three assistants, who with
<em>Wátu Gúnung</em> had constituted the council of five, he declared
that they should serve to commemorate the four great revolutions
or <em>Nága</em> (serpents:) <em>Nága Búmí</em> (of the earth,) <em>Nága
Dína</em> (of the day,) <em>Nága Wúlan</em> (of the moon,) <em>Nága Táhun</em>
(of the year.) He struck out both the eyes of <em>Nága Búmi</em>,
that the earth might never again see to attack the heavens, and
afterwards the left eye of <em>Nága Dína</em>, and the right eye of
<em>Nága Wúlan</em>.</p>

<p>[Here that part of the relation which has an astronomical
reference breaks off.]</p>

<p><em>Bráma</em> then following the example of <em>Naráda</em>, purifies himself,
and at his desire, first there appears before him a boy of
strong make, on whom he confers the name of <em>Bráma Táma</em>;
secondly, a boy, also of strong make, whom he names <em>Bráma
Sudárga</em>; and thirdly, a beautiful girl, on whom he confers
the name of <em>Bramáni Wáti</em>.</p>

<p>The two boys, when they attained maturity, descended from
<em>Suralága</em>. <em>Bráma Sudárga</em> united in marriage with a female
of the earth: from them, in the third degree, were descended
<em>Raja Sumáli</em> and <em>Mangliáwan</em>. In the reign of the latter of
these a destructive war is stated to have taken place. <em>Mangliáwan</em>
laid waste <em>Suraláya</em> and slew <em>Sri Gáti</em>, but afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Vol I Pg 425]</a></span>
when he shewed a desire to possess <em>Sri</em>, <em>Wísnu</em> exerted
all his strength, and put him to death. As <em>Mangliáwan</em>
expired <em>Wísnu</em> heard a voice saying unto him, "The work
is not yet complete; hereafter, when there shall be on
earth a man named <em>Rahwána</em>, who will be descended
from <em>Bráma Táma</em>, beware of him: in his time the peace
of heaven will be again disturbed, and he will lay it waste."
<em>Bráma Táma</em> espoused a princess of <em>Chámpa</em>, named <em>S'ráti
Déwi</em>, by whom he had a son, named <em>Bráma Rája</em>, who became
<em>Raja</em> of <em>Indrapúri</em>, and had a son named <em>Chítra Bahár</em>
or <em>Angsárwa</em>, to whom, when he became advanced in
age, he delivered over charge of the country, proceeding himself
into the forests as a devotee, and assuming the name of
<em>Rési Táma</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sumáli</em> had a daughter, named <em>Sukési Déwi</em>. This prince,
alarmed at the accounts of <em>Mangliáwan's</em>  death, fled with her
to <em>Chítra Bahár</em>, and requested him to protect her as a
maiden, giving him authority to sanction her marriage on any
proper occasion which might offer. He himself fearing the
vengeance of <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em>, fled further into the woods
for concealment, but died on the way. <em>Chítra Bahár</em>, forgetting
the nature of his charge, became enamoured of the
girl. This happened when he was performing a penance;
for he had two sons, named <em>Mísra Wárna</em> and <em>Bísa Wárna</em>,
to the former of whom he had intrusted the charge of his government.
The girl resisted on account of his age, but he at
last succeeded. During the first amour he received from her
nine strokes on the head with a stone. In due time she became
pregnant and was delivered of a boy, having nine marks
or excrescences on his head, which added to his natural face,
making as it were ten fronts to his head: he was thence
called <em>Dása múka</em> (ten-faced.) In the second attempt she
pulled the lobes of both his ears with great strength, and when
delivered she produced a child in the form of a <em>Rasáksa</em>, and
having immense lobes to the ears: this child was named
<em>Amba kárna</em>, or long-eared. In the third she scratched him
all over, and the fruit of it was a girl, born with long nails
and claws at the end of each finger: she was named <em>Sárpa
kanáka</em>, or serpent-nailed; the wounds inflicted by these
nails are said to have been mortal. But the fourth being un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Vol I Pg 426]</a></span>resisted,
she was delivered of a most beautiful boy, who, having
a countenance and mouth beautiful like those of a girl,
was named <em>Bibisána</em>.</p>

<p>When these children were grown up <em>Chítra Bahár</em> carried
them to <em>Mísra Wárna</em>, saying, "these are your brothers and
sister, assist them, and they will be of use to you in your
government." <em>Mísra Wárna</em> had a great dread of thunder.
He possessed a weapon called <em>límpung</em>, which descended to
him from <em>Bráma Rája</em>, and <em>Dása Múka</em>, desirous of possessing
it, ingratiated himself into his favour, but no sooner
obtained possession of it than he formed a design against his
brother's life, in the hope of succeeding him. He accordingly
performed a penance and prayed for thunder, and as soon as
it was heard he slew his brother, and gave out that he disappeared
during the thunder. At the moment, however, that he
struck <em>Mísra Wárna</em> with the weapon it vanished; still he
became Raja.</p>

<p>In the mean time <em>Bísa Wárna</em> became beloved by the gods,
and they presented to him a car, named <em>jaladára</em>, in which
he could be conveyed through the clouds. When <em>Dása
Múka</em> heard of this he became enraged, and demanded the
carriage for himself; but he had no sooner made the request
than he perceived his lost weapon descend upon the lap of
<em>Bísa Wárna</em>. Still more enraged at this, the altercation did
not cease until <em>Bísa Wárna</em>, with one blow, laid him senseless
on the ground; at which moment the father, <em>Chítra Bahár</em>,
coming up, he succeeded in reconciling them, and with impressing
upon <em>Dása Múka</em> the futility of his attempts against
his brother. <em>Chítra Bahár</em> on this occasion repeated several
invocations to the deity, which were treasured up in the recollection
of after ages: such as <em>Hong! Awígna; Hong!
Widadánia; Hong! Widadáni</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The father, however, had no sooner withdrawn, than <em>Dása
Múka</em> again took courage, and another combat ensued, which
ended in his being a second time struck senseless on the
ground, blood issuing from his mouth. <em>Bísa Wárna</em> then
laying hold of his body was about to cut his throat with the
<em>limpung</em>, when <em>Rési Naráda</em> appeared and arrested his hand,
saying, "forbear, <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> does not permit that you
slay your brother. By attending to this advice you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Vol I Pg 427]</a></span>
hereafter become a deity in heaven. Give your weapon to
your brother, who is Raja of <em>Indrapúri</em>." <em>Bisa Wárna</em> assenting,
<em>Rési Naráda</em> then brought <em>Dása Múka</em> to his senses,
and delivering over to him the weapon and car, conferred
upon him the name of <em>Rah-wána</em><a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>, from his blood having
flowed in such quantity as to reach the adjoining forest.</p>

<p>[In some copies of this work it is said that <em>Dása Múka</em> was
called <em>Rahwána</em>, because in his youth he delighted in the destruction
of children and to spill their blood. There is also
some variation in this part of the story, and <em>Citrá Bahár</em> is
termed <em>Chátor Bója</em> (four-shouldered), on account of the
great strength he exhibited in the war with <em>Níli Kewácha</em>].</p>

<p><em>Rési Naráda</em> then presented <em>Rahwána</em> to <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em>,
who taking a liking to him adopted him as his son, giving
him a <em>saléndang</em><a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> as a mark of his affection. <em>Rahwána</em>, however,
was soon dazzled by the appearance of a bright flame,
when forgetting the attachment of <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em>, he pursued
it, until he came into the presence of <em>Sri</em>, from whose
beauty it proceeded. She, however, ran to her husband
<em>Wísnu</em> for succour, and a severe combat ensued, during which
the heavens were disturbed, and many of its most valuable
contents were destroyed by <em>Rahwána</em>. <em>Rési Naráda</em> at length
approaching, separated the combatants, saying, "this is not
the proper place for your contention; better had you descend
to the earth. As for you, <em>Wísnu</em>, as you are a god,
and may be ashamed to shew yourself as such on earth, it is
the will of <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> that you be permitted to appear
there in the form of a man, and to do there as you like."
On which <em>Rahwána</em> was cast out of <em>Suraláya</em>, and <em>Wísnu</em>,
with his consort <em>Sri</em>, disappeared, without any one knowing
whither they went.</p>

<p><em>Bísa Wárna</em> was then, in fulfilment of the promise given
by <em>Naráda</em>, called up to heaven, to supply the place among
the <em>Déwas</em> vacated by <em>Wísnu</em>, and approaching the presence
of <em>Sáng yáng Gúru</em> received from him the name of <em>Batára
Asmára</em> or <em>Kamajáya</em> (the god of love), and presented him
with a consort, named <em>Káma Ráti</em> or <em>Batári Ráti</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Vol I Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>[Here ends the <em>Kérta Yoga</em>, or first age of the world, and
the <em>Tréta Yóga</em>, or second age, commences.]</p>

<p><em>Wísnu</em>, after his descent upon the earth, first became incarnate
in the person of an illustrious sovereign, named <em>Arjúna
Wijáya</em>, of the country of <em>Mauspáti</em>, and reigned for a period
of seventeen years, during which he was successful in two
wars. One, in which the <em>Rája</em> of <em>Tánjung-púra</em>, having a
beautiful daughter, named <em>Chítra Wáti</em>, in whom <em>Sri</em> had
become incarnate, offered her in marriage to the prince who
should overcome in wrestling all the others assembled: <em>Arjúna
Wijáya</em>, however, carried her off from the place in
which she was secreted (<em>Gedóng Brahála</em>) which produced
a war, wherein he was victorious. The other war was with
<em>Rahwána</em>, who attacked him at <em>Mauspáti</em>: in this <em>Rahwána</em>
was taken prisoner and confined in a cage; but on the solicitations
of his father, <em>Chítra Bahár</em>, he was forgiven, and allowed
to return to his country, on condition that neither he
nor his descendants would ever again make war on <em>Arjúna
Wijáya</em>.</p>

<p><em>Wísnu</em> afterwards quitting the body of <em>Arjúna Wijáya</em>
became incarnate in the person of <em>Ráma</em>, son of <em>Dása Ráta</em>
(who when young was called <em>Murdáka</em>), entering the body
of his mother during conception, and coming into the world
with the child. About the same time <em>Batára Basúki</em>, who
had a son named <em>Baswárat</em>, united to <em>Bramáni Wáti</em>, becoming
sorrowful, quitted <em>Suraláya</em>, with a determination to
follow the fortunes of <em>Wisnu</em>, who after quitting the body of
<em>Arjúna Wijáya</em> roamed for some time round the skirts of the
earth until he fell in with <em>Basúki</em>. <em>Wisnu</em> then said to him,
"there is a <em>Raja</em> of <em>Mándra-púra</em>, named <em>Bása Ráta</em>, who
has two wives, named <em>Déwi Rágu</em> and <em>Mánwa-dári</em>. I am
younger than you, but on earth I must be older. I will enter
the body of <em>Rágu</em>, and become incarnate in the child
she will bring forth; do you the same with the other."
<em>Mánwa-dári</em> was delivered of a child named <em>Lakasamána</em>, in
which <em>Basúki</em> accordingly became incarnate.</p>

<p>[The portion of the work, which also includes a relation
of the feats of <em>Báli</em> son of <em>Gotáma</em>, the founder of <em>Astíno</em>,
brings the story down to the period of the poem of <em>Ráma</em>.
The history is then carried on to the period of the <em>Pendáwa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Vol I Pg 429]</a></span>
Líma</em> or <em>Bráta Yudha</em>, and may be concisely stated as follows:]</p>

<p><em>Baswárat</em>, son of <em>Basúki</em>, had by <em>Bramáni Wáti</em> two sons,
<em>Mánu-Manára</em> and <em>Mánu-Madéwa</em>. The daughter of <em>Mánu-Madéwa</em>,
named <em>Siráti</em>, was married to <em>Bramána Rája</em>, and
from this marriage proceeded <em>Rahwána</em>. The <em>Pendáwa
Líma</em> were tenth in descent from <em>Mánu-Manára</em>, as in the
following pedigree:</p>


<ul><li>1. <em>Mánu-Manása</em>,</li>
<li>2. <em>Tritrushta</em>,</li>
<li>3. <em>Parikéna</em>,</li>
<li>4. <em>Sutápa</em>,</li>
<li>5. <em>Sa-pútram</em>,</li>
<li>6. <em>Sákri</em>,</li>
<li>7. <em>Pulasára</em>,</li>
<li>8. <em>Abiása</em>,</li>
<li>9. <em>Pándu-déwa Náta</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Tréta Yóga</em> or second age, is supposed to have ended,
and the <em>Duapára Yóga</em>, or third age, to have commenced
on the death of <em>Ráma</em>, which happened about the time of
<em>Sákri</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Wiwáha káwi</em> is a regular poem, and contains three
hundred and fifty-five <em>páda</em>, or metrical stanzas. The subject
is as follows:</p>

<p><em>Erang Báyu</em> had a son, whose form was that of a <em>Rasáksa</em>,
and who became sovereign of the country of <em>Ima-ímantáka</em>,
under the name of <em>Détia Kéwácha</em>. The father, desirous of
getting rid of him, urged him to go to <em>Suréndra Buána</em>, in
search of a flower, called <em>Turáng'ga játi</em>, which was worn by
all the <em>Widadáris</em>. The <em>Rasáksa</em> accordingly goes in search
of it, and no sooner comes into the presence of <em>Batára Gúru</em>,
than a <em>Widadári</em> sitting by his side, named <em>Su Prába</em>, the
daughter of <em>Batára Sámba</em>, presents one of these flowers to
him, with which he returns to his father, who alarmed at his
success, immediately delivers over to him the government of
his country.</p>

<p>After <em>Détia Kéwácha</em> had thus become sovereign, he desired
to be united in marriage with the <em>Widadári</em> who had
given him the flower, and dispatches a <em>Rasáksa</em> named <em>Kolángkía</em>,
with a letter addressed to <em>Batára Gúru</em>, soliciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Vol I Pg 430]</a></span>
<em>Su Prába</em> in marriage, and threatening to destroy the heavens
in case of refusal. When the messenger reached <em>Suréndra
Buána</em> he presented the letter to <em>Batára Sákra</em>, who
knowing its contents without reading it, immediately replied
in a rage, "then let your sovereign carry his threat into execution,
for <em>Bitára Gúru</em> will never consent that a <em>Widadári</em>
be married to a <em>Rasáksa</em>."</p>

<p>When the messenger had disappeared, <em>Batára Sákra</em> communicated
to the gods the state of affairs, on which <em>Batára
Gúru</em> became enraged. As he curbed his passion, <em>Naráka</em>
becomes disturbed; smoke issued from its deepest recesses
and the heavens rocked to and fro. <em>Rési Naráda</em> then apprised
<em>Batára Gúru</em> that there was a man on the earth, named
<em>Bagáwan Wardiníngsih</em>, or <em>Mitarága</em>, who had long performed
his devotions on the mountain <em>Indra-kíla</em>, and suggested
that it might be better to employ him against <em>Detia
Kewácha</em> than for the gods, who were ignorant of the art of
war, to await in heaven the coming of the <em>Rasáksa</em>. <em>Batára
Gúru</em> approves of the suggestion, and <em>Rési Naráda</em> descends
accordingly to <em>Indra-kíla</em>, accompanied by seven <em>Widadáris</em>,
in the hope that by the influence of their charms, he might
succeed in abstracting <em>Wardiníngsih</em> from the severe penance
which he was performing. The names of the <em>Widadáris</em>
who accompanied him were <em>Su Prába</em>, <em>Wilotáma</em>, <em>Leng-leng-Mandana</em>,
<em>Sumartáka</em>, <em>Ang'impuni</em>, <em>Su Prába-sini</em>, and <em>Dérsa-nála</em>.
In their train followed a thousand of the young and
beautiful maids of heaven.</p>

<p><em>Wardiníngsih</em> was performing a long and rigid penance,
for the purpose of recovering the kingdom of <em>Astína</em>; and
when <em>Naráda</em> arrived at <em>Indra-kíla</em>, the sun had climbed
half way up the heavens. The <em>Widadáris</em> immediately displayed
their charms, and employed every artifice to attract
his attention, but they could not succeed. One of them, who
resembled his wife, even threw off her upper garments, and
exposing her bosom embraced him with transport; but it did
not avail.</p>

<p><em>Batára Sákra</em> then descended to <em>Indra-kíla</em>, in the disguise
of a Dervise, assuming the name of <em>Panjíngrum</em>, and
approaching <em>Wardiníngsih</em>, as if in grief, threw off his disguise,
and resuming the god, addressed <em>Wardiníngsih</em> as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Vol I Pg 431]</a></span>
follows: "My visit to you is on three accounts; first, I request
your assistance in this war; secondly, I wish to apprise
you, that <em>Batára Gúru</em> will in a short time appear
to you; thirdly, to advise you, that when you see <em>Batára
Gúru</em>, and he asks you whether you have courage to engage
in the war or not, you answer that you have; requesting,
however, in return, that when the war <em>Bráta Yúdha</em> takes
place, the <em>Pandáwa</em> may be successful. You may then
request two arrows, called <em>paso páti</em> and <em>trisula</em>, and the
crown <em>cháping basunánda</em>, the vest <em>ánta kasúma</em>, the slippers
<em>márdu kachárma</em>: these slippers, when you wear them,
will enable you to fly, and to enter heaven in person. Request,
moreover, the chariot <em>mánik</em>, which is drawn by
elephants and horses of the heavenly race (<em>sambráni</em>), and
called <em>chípta waláha</em>, and that if you are successful in the
war with <em>Détia Kewácha</em>, <em>Batára Gúru</em>, as well as the
other gods, may each present you with a <em>Widadári</em>." <em>Batára
Sákra</em> having made an impression on the mind of
<em>Wardiníngsih</em> returned to heaven.</p>

<p>In the mean time <em>Mang-máng Múrka</em>, the <em>Peptáeh</em>  of
<em>Détia Kewácha</em>, who had a face like a hog, received orders
to lay waste the mountain of <em>Indra-Kíla</em>. He no sooner
arrived there, and began to destroy the cultivation, than
<em>Sémar</em> gave information of it to <em>Wardiníngsih</em>, who coming
forth with his bow and arrow, immediately struck the <em>Rasáksa</em>;
upon which <em>Batára Gúru</em> appeared in the form of a
forester, holding in his hand a bow without an arrow. Then
straggling with <em>Wardiníngsih</em> to withdraw the arrow with
which the <em>Rasáksa</em> had been struck, each pulled at it ineffectually
until a quarrel ensued, in which <em>Batára Gúru</em> accused
<em>Wardiníngsih</em> of having a bad heart, and of following the
dictates of his <em>Gúru Dúrna</em>, who was at <em>Astina</em>, and who had
a crooked nose and mouth. <em>Wardiníngsih</em> being enraged at
this, a severe combat ensued, when <em>Batára Gúru</em> having laid
hold of his adversary's hair, the other attempted to retaliate,
on which <em>Batára Gúru</em> vanished. A fragrant odour immediately
arose, and <em>Wardiníngsih</em> reflected upon what <em>Sákra</em>
had told him, and instantly perceived a bright arch, like the
rainbow, with <em>Batára Gúru</em> appearing within it, attended by
<em>Rési Naráda</em> and a suite of <em>Widadáris</em>: bowing profoundly
to the ground, he felt himself permitted to approach the deity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Vol I Pg 432]</a></span>
and kiss his feet; <em>Batára Gúru</em> then informed him of his
object in coming to <em>Indra-kíla</em>, and requested that he would
make war upon <em>Détia Kewácha</em>, who was the enemy of the
gods; to which <em>Wardiníngsih</em> consented, making the requests
which had been suggested by <em>Batára Sákra</em>. To
these <em>Batára Gúru</em> assented, adding, "If you have success
in this war, I will appoint you sovereign of the heavens for
one year. You shall have power over all the gods, and the
<em>Widadáris</em> shall be your attendants; and as long as you
live you shall have power to visit <em>Suraláya</em> at your pleasure."
This said, <em>Batára Gúru</em> disappeared.</p>

<p>On the next day <em>Wardiníngsih</em> prepared for his journey to
<em>Ima imantáka</em>, the country of <em>Détia Kewácha</em>, and on his
way thither fell in with the <em>Widadáris</em>, <em>Su Prába</em> and <em>Wilá
Táma</em>, who had been sent by <em>Batára Sákra</em>. <em>Wardiníngsih</em>,
on his arrival at the <em>Rasáksa's</em> capital, commissioned these
<em>Widadáris</em> to enter the palace and feign an attachment for
<em>Détia Kewácha</em>. <em>Détia Kewácha</em> no sooner beheld them,
than being thrown off his guard, he declared, that the object
of the war being thus attained without trouble, he would enjoy
himself at his ease. Then dressing himself in his princely
robes, and perfuming himself as a bridegroom, he approached
<em>Su Prába</em>, and taking her on his knee chaunted a song, which
so delighted her that she fell asleep. <em>Wardiníngsih</em>, on this,
entered into her ear-stud, and awoke her. <em>Detia Kewácha</em>
then urged her to gratify his passion, but she refused, and required,
as a mark of confidence, that he would trust her with
the secret of his power. This he refused, until she was about
to stab herself, when he whispered in her ear that he was invulnerable
except within his throat; if any one injured that
part in the least he must instantly die. <em>Wardiníngsih</em> thus
ascertaining his vulnerable point, escaped with the <em>Widadáris</em>,
and ascended to <em>Batára Sákra</em> in <em>Suraláya</em>.</p>

<p><em>Détia Kewácha</em>, then collecting his forces, proceeded to
the war with a countless host, laying waste the country, until
he arrived near <em>Tánda Wáru</em>, where he halted to make preparations
for the attack. The heavens now shook, and <em>Naráka</em>
emitted smoke. The gods trembled with fear, and the
wind, charged with the gross stench of the <em>Rasáksa</em>, almost
overpowered them.</p>

<p><em>Wardiníngsih</em> having arrived at the abode of <em>Sákra</em>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Vol I Pg 433]</a></span>
great bell (<em>gatíta</em>) was struck, when the gods immediately
assembled. The forces of <em>Suraláya</em> then moved on, <em>Wardiníngsih</em>
following in a splendid chariot. Having thrown off
the <em>Pandíta's</em> garment, he now appeared richly clothed in the
character of <em>Arjúna</em>, adorned with gold and costly gems. The
chariot had formerly belonged to <em>Ráma</em>, and had been preserved
by <em>Batára Gúru</em>, when <em>Ráma</em> committed himself to
the flames.</p>

<p>The battle commenced, and the forces of the <em>Rasáksa</em> being
most numerous and powerful, were about to carry all before
them, when <em>Gatot Kácha</em> arrived, and taking part with <em>Wardiníngsih</em>,
turned the tide of the battle in favour of the gods,
plucking up the mountains by the roots, and casting them
upon the <em>Rasáksas</em>. <em>Détia Kewácha</em> escaping the general
overthrow, and attended by <em>Sécha Tung'gára</em>, shot an arrow
at <em>Wardiníngsih</em>, which the latter caught under his arm, and
feigning death, fell to the ground. Great was the grief of
<em>Sémar</em> and of all his other attendants; but <em>Détia Kewácha</em>
approaching burst out into a loud laugh, when <em>Wardiníngsih</em>,
who had watched his opportunity, observing the <em>Rasáksa's</em>
mouth open, instantly rose, and struck the arrow into it, and
so killed him.</p>

<p><em>Gátot Kácha</em>, who, in consequence of the absence of
<em>Arjúna</em> on a penance for three years, had been sent to recall
him, and who had discovered him by the appearance of his
attendant <em>Sémar</em>, now approached <em>Wardiníngsih</em>, and kissing
his feet, informed him of the sorrow of <em>Séna</em> and <em>Dérma
Wángsa</em> at his absence, on which <em>Wardiníngsih</em> desired him
to return and report what he had seen.</p>

<p>He then proceeded, attended by the victorious host, to the
dwelling of <em>Batára Gúru</em>, called <em>Papáriwárna</em>; on which
<em>Batára Gúru</em> assembling the gods, and permitting <em>Wardiníngsih</em>
to approach and kiss his feet, declares to him that he
was not forgetful of his promise, and would forthwith fulfil it.
He then declared him sovereign of <em>Suraláya</em>, under the title
<em>Prábu Aníli Kíti</em>, and gave him free access to every part of
the heavens. <em>Arjúná</em> then visited the seven quarters of <em>Suraláya</em>,
in which was the abode of the <em>Widadáris</em>, and assumed
the sovereignty accordingly; while <em>Gatot Kácha</em>, proceeding
to <em>Amérta</em>, informed <em>Séna</em> and <em>Dérma Wángsa</em> of what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Vol I Pg 434]</a></span>
passed. There were also present at his relation <em>Nakóla Sa
déwa</em>, <em>Batára Krésna</em>, <em>Sámbu</em>, and <em>Panchawála</em>, all equally
anxious to know the fate of <em>Arjúna</em>. <em>Déwi Kúnti</em>, the mother
of <em>Pandáwa</em>, having calculated on the death of <em>Arjúna</em>, and
made preparation for burning herself in consequence, was
overjoyed at this unexpected good news; and <em>Dérma Wángsa</em>,
the sovereign <em>Amérta</em>, gave a grand entertainment, in which
the <em>Bedáyas</em> danced to the sound of the music, while <em>Gàtot
Kácha</em> related the feats of <em>Arjúna</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Ráma Káwi</em> is usually divided into four parts. The
first, called <em>Ráma Gán-drung</em>, contains the history of <em>Ráma</em>,
from his infancy until his marriage; the second, <em>Ráma Bádra</em>,
from his marriage until his consort, <em>Síti Déwi</em>, is carried off
by <em>Rahwána</em>; the third, <em>Ráma Táli</em>, from the first employment
of <em>Hánuman</em> as a <em>dúta</em> or messenger, until he builds the
bridge from the continent to the island <em>Ang'lángka-di púra</em>;
and the fourth, called <em>Ramayána</em> (by which is understood
<em>Ráma</em> when arrived at his full power), from the beginning of
the war of <em>Dána Lága</em> on <em>Lánka</em> till the end of it, when
<em>Ráma</em> regains his consort <em>Siti Déwi</em>, and returns to <em>Nayúdía</em>,
leaving <em>Rahwána's</em> brother, <em>Bibisána</em>, sovereign of <em>Lángka</em>.
Of these the <em>Rámayána</em> is the most common on Java. The
<em>Ráma Táli</em> has been recently obtained from <em>Báli</em>. This composition,
as one poem, is by far the most extensive of any
which the Javans possess.</p>

<p>The mythology contained in the <em>Ráma</em> differs, in some
measure, from that of the <em>Kánda</em>. <em>Ráma</em> is here made to
relate to <em>Bibisána</em>, in <em>Artáti</em> measure but <em>Káwi</em> language,
that <em>Bráma</em>, in the first instance, sprang from <em>Wísnu</em>; that
in the beginning of the world, <em>Wísnu</em> existed in that part of
the heavens named <em>Antabóga</em>, the place of serpents; that
<em>Bráma</em> first communicated the knowledge of the <em>Sástra</em>.
Nine incarnations of <em>Wísnu</em> are then detailed: the first, when
he appeared as <em>Iwak Mokúr-mo</em> (the tortoise); the second, as
<em>Sing'ha</em> (the lion), when he was called <em>Barúna</em>; the third, as
<em>Arjúna Wijáya</em>; the fourth in <em>Winákitáya</em> or <em>Ráma</em>. In the
fifth he was to appear as <em>Krésna</em>; and after the sixth, seventh,
and eighth, in the ninth when he would become incarnate in
the person of a great sovereign, named <em>Prábu Purúsa</em>.</p>

<p><em>Anráka Súra</em> (the courageous child of the sun) is written in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Vol I Pg 435]</a></span>
<em>Káwi</em>, but translated into Javan, under the name of <em>Búma
Kalantáka</em>, or <em>Emba táli</em>. The period to which it refers is
that occupied posterior to that of the <em>Wiwáha</em>, and prior to
that of the <em>Bráta Yúdha</em>. It relates almost exclusively to
the exploits of <em>Búma</em>, who was the son of <em>Déwi Pratíwi</em>, of
the race of <em>Widadáris</em>.</p>

<p><em>Déwi Pratíwi</em> being enamoured of <em>Wísnu</em>, her thoughts
were continually turned towards him, notwithstanding he had
been cast out of <em>Suraláya</em>. One night having dreamt that her
passion for him was gratified, she conceived a child. She
afterwards heard in her sleep a voice saying to her, "Descend
to the earth in search of <em>Krésna</em>, for <em>Wísnu</em> is become incarnate
in his person: his colour is deep black." She
descended accordingly; and established herself at <em>Praju-téksna</em>,
where she was delivered of a son, whom she named
<em>Búma Kalantáka</em>. When he arrived at maturity, she informed
him who was his father, and when he discovered him
he was received and acknowledged by him. <em>Krésna</em> had
afterwards another son, named <em>Sámba</em>, who having insulted
the wife of <em>Búma</em> a quarrel arose between the two brothers,
in which <em>Búma</em> put <em>Sámba</em> to death in a most disgraceful
manner, mangling and exposing his body. <em>Krésna</em>, enraged
at this, threw his <em>Chákra</em> at <em>Búma</em>, desiring <em>Gátot Kácha</em> to
raise him from the earth the moment he is struck, lest the
power of his mother should restore him. <em>Gátot Kácha</em> obeys
his orders and <em>Búma</em> is destroyed. <em>Séna</em>, one of the sons of
<em>Pándu</em>, is one of the personages of this poem.</p>

<p>The history of the succeeding period is contained in the
<em>Bráta Yudha</em>, or holy war, the most popular and esteemed
work in the language. This poem is identified in its subject
with the <em>Mahabárat</em> of continental India, in the same manner
as that of <em>Ráma</em> is with the <em>Ramáyan</em>. An analysis of this
poem will be given under the head poetry.</p>

<p>Next, in point of time, to this story, follows that of the
poem called <em>Parakísit</em>, which abounds with the praises of
that prince, who was the son of <em>Bimányu</em> and grandson of
<em>Arjúna</em>, and is descriptive of the tranquillity and happiness
which universally prevailed during his reign. It also contains
an historical relation of the sovereigns who succeeded him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Vol I Pg 436]</a></span>
and brings down the line of princes from <em>Parikísit</em> through
ten descents to <em>Aji Jáya Báya</em>, as follows.</p>


<ul><li>​&mdash; <em>Parikísit.</em></li>

<li>1. <em>Súma Wichítra.</em></li>

<li>2. <em>Ang'ling Dría.</em></li>

<li>3. <em>Udiána.</em></li>

<li>4. <em>Madiwáng'i.</em></li>

<li>5. <em>Miséna.</em></li>

<li>6.</li>

<li>7.</li>

<li>8.</li>

<li>9. <em>Súma Wichála.</em></li>

<li>10. <em>Aji Jáya Báya.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>It was during the reign of the last of these princes that
the first intercourse with Western India is supposed to have
taken place; an account of the historical composition relating
to a subsequent period is therefore reserved for the chapters
on History.</p>

<p>The <em>Súria Kétu</em> (or lofty sun) contains in a few stanzas the
history of a prince, the fifth in descent from the <em>Kuráwa</em>,
who by dint of prayer to the gods obtained a son named
<em>Kérta Súma</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Níti Sástra Káwi</em> is a work on ethics, comprized in
one hundred and twenty-three stanzas, each of which contains
a moral lesson: it is considered coeval with, if not more
ancient than the <em>Bráta Yudha</em>, and the <em>Káwi</em> is considered
the most pure extant. The modern version of this work has
already been referred to, and translations of some of the
stanzas have been introduced. The following are taken indiscriminately,
and translated immediately from the <em>Káwi</em>.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>A man who is moderate and cool in his desires will do good
to a country. A woman is like unto <em>Déwi Manuhára</em>
when her desires are moderate, and men cannot look
upon her without delight. A <em>Pandíta</em> must act up to
his doctrines; although it may be in war and difficulty,
still he must act up to what he professes.</p>

<p>This must be the conduct of the <em>Pandíta</em>. If attacked by
a serpent, he must not be moved by it, nor even by a
lion: still the same, he must be firm and unmoved, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Vol I Pg 437]</a></span>
neither the serpent nor the lion will have power to hurt
him.</p>

<p>As the <em>surája</em> flower floats in the water, so does the heart
exist in a pure body; but let it not be forgotten, that the
root of the flower holds to the ground, and that the heart
of man depends upon his conduct in life. The conduct
of a <em>Pandíta</em> must be distinguished by mercy, charity,
firmness, and prudence. His speech should be soft and
gentle, and in accordance with and like unto written instruction,
so as to moderate and calm the mind and desires
of mankind.</p>

<p>It is mean and low for a rich man not to dress well: it is
still more mean and low for a man of understanding to
mix with bad company. So it is when a man attains a
high age and knows not the <em>Sástra</em>; but when a man,
through the whole course of his life, does not reflect upon
his conduct, such a man is of no use in the world whatever.</p>

<p>A man should wear that sort of apparel which in the general
opinion is considered proper, and should also eat that
kind of food which is generally approved of. If he does
this, he will appear like unto a virgin, who has just attained
maturity. Let him not follow implicitly the advice
and instruction he may receive, but let him weigh
them, and select what is good by his own understanding.</p>

<p>In war, let there be no fear on any account, but let the
whole thoughts be directed to the main object of urging
the warriors to the attack of the foe. Moreover, let the
thoughts be directed to what may be the enemy's plans:
this done, let the heart feel fire.</p>

<p>When a man engages another in his service, there are
four points on which he should satisfy himself respecting
him. First, his appearance: secondly, his conduct;
thirdly, his intelligence; and fourthly, his honesty.</p>

<p>The most valuable property is gold; and whoever has much
of it, if he does not assist those who are poor and in
want, is like unto a house without a fence, and he will
soon be deprived of the property which he possesses.</p>

<p>As the moon and the stars shed their light by night, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Vol I Pg 438]</a></span>
sun giveth light by day, so should the sayings of a wise
man enlighten all around him.</p>

<p>Follow not the seeming wisdom of a woman's discourse;
for as a man is more powerful and better informed than
a woman, it is fitter that he should stand on his own
ground.</p>

<p>A man who knows not the customs of the country (<em>yúdya
Nagára</em>), is like a man who would bind an elephant
with cords made from the <em>tánjung</em> flower. It is not necessary
for the elephant to be enraged: with the least
motion he breaks the cords asunder.</p>

<p>Deprive not another of the credit which is due to him, nor
lower him in the opinion of the world: for the sun, when
he approaches near to the moon, in depriving her of her
light adds nothing to his own lustre.</p>

<p>There is nothing better in the world than a man who keeps
his word; and there is nothing worse than a man who
swerves from his word, for he is a liar. There are five
witnesses, which may be seen by every one: <em>Yang-anála</em>
or <em>Bráma</em> (fire), <em>Súria</em> (the sun), <em>Chándra</em> (the moon),
<em>Kála</em> (time), <em>Báyu</em> (life). And they are the great witnesses
always present throughout the three worlds; therefore
let men recollect never to lie.</p>

<p>There are three things which destroy a man's character, and
they are as three poisons: the first, to disgrace his family
or lower himself; the second, to take delight in bringing
misfortunes and unhappiness upon others; the third, to
be a hypocrite, and assume the character of a <em>Pandíta</em>.</p></div>

<p>Several works have been recently discovered in <em>Báli</em>, called
<em>Agáma</em>, <em>Adigáma</em>, <em>Púrwa Digáma</em>, <em>Súrcha</em>, <em>Muscháyagáma</em>,
<em>Kantára</em> or <em>Sástra Menáwa</em>, <em>Dewagáma</em>, <em>Maiswári</em>, <em>Tatwa</em>,
<em>Wiya Wasáha</em>, <em>Dásta Kalabáya</em>, <em>Slákan Taragáma</em>, <em>Satmagáma</em>,
<em>Gamíga Gamána</em>. Of many of these, copies have been
procured, and the <em>Sástra Menáwa</em>, or institutions of <em>Menu</em>, have
been partially translated into English. This is a book of law
comprised in about one hundred and sixty sections, evidently
written on the spot, and with reference to the peculiar habits
and dispositions of the people for whom it was framed. As
a code of civil law, it is remarkable for the proof it affords of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Vol I Pg 439]</a></span>
the existence of actual property in the land; and as a criminal
code, for the frequency of capital punishment, and the almost
total absence of all degrading or minor corporeal punishment.</p>

<p>Of the more modern compositions, and which may be considered
as more strictly Javan, the following are the principal:</p>

<p><em>Angréné</em> is an historical work, which commences with the
reign of <em>Sri Jáya Langkára</em> sovereign of <em>Médang Kamúlan</em>,
the grandfather of the celebrated <em>Pánji</em>, and concludes with
the death of <em>Pánji</em>. This is the longest work to be found in
the modern literature of Java, and contains the most interesting
and important part of Javan history immediately antecedent
to the establishment of Mahomedanism. It is composed
in several measures of the <em>Sékar Gángsal</em>, and is usually divided
into several smaller works, to each of which the name
of Pánji is prefixed, as:</p>

<p><em>Pánji Mordaningkung.</em> The history of that part of the
<em>Pánji's</em> life, when his consort, <em>Sékar-táji</em>, is carried off by a
deity. This is replete with relations of his adventures in war,
and partly written in the <em>Sékar Sépoh</em> and partly in the <em>Sékar
Gángsal</em>.</p>

<p><em>Pánji Magát-kung</em> relates to that period when the object
of <em>Pánji's</em> love was not yet attained.</p>

<p><em>Pánji-áng'ron ákung</em>, containing the particulars of marriage
ceremonies observed by <em>Pánji</em>.</p>

<p><em>Pánji priambáda</em>, containing an account of the success
and completion of <em>Pánji's</em> love, and ending with his marriage.</p>

<p><em>Pánji Jáya Kasúma.</em> This is one of the names assumed
by <em>Pánji</em> after the loss of his consort, <em>Sékar-táji</em> and contains
an account of his expedition to <em>Báli</em>, where he regained her.</p>

<p><em>Pánji Chékel Wáning Páti</em> (when young brave even to
death) contains the juvenile exploits of this hero.</p>

<p><em>Pánji Norowangsa</em> includes the period of his life, when the
Princess of <em>Dahá</em> transforms herself into a man.</p>

<p>Neither the date of the principal work from which these
minor compositions are taken, nor the name of the author is
known; but it is supposed to have been written subsequently
to the time of <em>Majapáhit</em>, the language being modern Javan.</p>

<p>Literary compositions of the higher cast are generally classed
by the Javans under the head of <em>Pepákam</em> or <em>Bábat</em>, the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Vol I Pg 440]</a></span>
of which includes all historical works and chronicles of modern
date.</p>

<p><em>Srúti</em> is a work which contains regulations for the conduct
and behaviour of an inferior to a superior. It is written in
the <em>Káwi</em> language, but <em>Artáti</em> measure, and has not yet been
translated into Javan. It is of the same length as the <em>Níti
Sástra Kâwi</em>.</p>

<p><em>Níti Prája</em> is composed in the same measure as the <em>Srúti</em>,
and contains regulations for the conduct of sovereigns and
chiefs, partly in the <em>Káwi</em> and partly in the Javan.</p>

<p><em>Asta Prája</em> is a work of the same nature and similarly composed.</p>

<p><em>Siwáka</em> contains regulations for behaviour when in the presence
of a superior, in the Javan language and <em>Artáti</em> measure.</p>

<p><em>Nagára Kráma</em>, regulations for the good administration of
the country, in the same language and measure.</p>

<p><em>Yúdha Nagára</em>, the customs of the country, containing
rules for the behaviour of persons of different ranks, in Javan
and in the <em>Artáti</em> and <em>Pamíjil</em> measures.</p>

<p><em>Kamandáka</em> contains instructions for inspiring respect and
fear in the exercise of authority, partly <em>Káwi</em>, partly Javan,
and in <em>Artáti</em> measure.</p>

<p>The seven last mentioned works are supposed to have been
written about the same period. The <em>Chándra Sangkála</em> of the
<em>Srúti</em> is 1340 of the Javan era. From the allusion to <em>Islam</em>
customs which they contain it is concluded that they were all
composed on the decline of <em>Majapáhit</em>, at a period when the
influence of that religion was rapidly gaining ground. These
works are in pretty general circulation, and form the basis of
the institutions and regulations of the country. The translation
already given of a modern version of the <em>Níti Prája</em> will
serve to shew their nature and tendency.</p>

<p><em>Jáya Langkára</em> is a work supposed to have been written
by a chief of that name, when sovereign of <em>Médang Kamúlan</em>,
and which contains regulations for the highest judicial proceedings.</p>

<p><em>Júgul Múda</em>, supposed to have been written by <em>Júgul
Múda</em> the <em>Páteh</em> or minister of <em>Kandiáwan</em>, chief of <em>Médang
Kamúlan</em>, containing rules for the guidance of <em>Pátehs</em> in the
judicial department of their office.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Vol I Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Gája Múda</em>, a similar work, supposed to have been written
by <em>Gája Múda</em>, the <em>Páteh</em> of the great <em>Browijáya</em> of <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p><em>Kápa Kápa</em>, regulations for the guidance of the sovereign
in the administration of justice.</p>

<p><em>Súria Alem</em>, a similar work for the guidance of all persons
entrusted with authority, supposed to have been composed by
<em>Aji Jímbon</em>, the first Mahomedan sovereign of Java.</p>

<p>None of the above works are written in verse. They form
the basis of what may be called the common law of the country.
The translation of the modern version of the last of these,
contained in the Appendix, will serve to convey some idea of
the nature and spirit of this class of compositions.</p>

<p>Besides the above may be noticed another work called
<em>Jáya Langkára</em>, a romance, supposed to have been written
in the time of <em>Susúnan Ampel</em>, in the Javan language and
modern measures. This is a moral work of considerable
length, written in allegory, and pointing out the duties of all
classes.</p>

<p>The <em>Jówar Maníkam</em> is of a more recent date, and a general
favourite: it may convey some notion of the modern romances
of the Javans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="hangindent">

<p>That is true love which makes the heart uneasy!</p>

<p>There was a woman who shone like a gem in the world, for
she was distinguished by her conduct, and her name was
<em>Jówar Maníkam</em>.</p>

<p>Perfect was her form, and she was descended from a
devotee, from whom she derived her purity and the rules
of her conduct.</p>

<p>Her beauty was like that of the children of heaven (<em>widadáris</em>),
and men saw more to admire in her, than was
to be found on the plains, on the mountains, or in the
seas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pure was her conduct, like that of a saint, and she never
forgot her devotions to the deity: all evil desires were
strangers to her heart.</p>

<p>She rose superior above the multitude from following the
dictates of religion, and in no one instance was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Vol I Pg 442]</a></span>
heart disturbed by a bad thought or desire, so that her
life was without reproach.</p>

<p>What pity it is she hath not a lover, for when a young and
handsome woman obtains a husband of high character
and qualifications, it is as milk mixed with sugar!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When her virtue was assailed by the <em>Panghúlu</em>, she was
astonished, and exclaimed, "why dost thou thus take
the course of a thief? why dost thou act in this
manner?</p>

<p>"Art thou not prohibited from doing thus? forgettest thou
thy <em>Rája</em>, and fearest thou not thy God?</p>

<p>"And thinkest thou not either of thyself? Greatly dost
thou astonish me! Is not thy conduct bad even
before the world? but being forbidden by the Almighty,
art thou not afraid of his anger?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"If such be thy desire, I can never consent to its indulgence,
for I fear my God, and for all such deeds the
punishment from heaven is great.</p>

<p>"Rather let me follow the course pointed out by the
prophet: let me imitate the conduct of his child
Fatima.</p>

<p>"How comes it, that thy inclination is so evil towards
me? Verily, if my father knew of this proceeding,
wouldst thou not justly receive severe punishment?"</p></div>

<p>The <em>Panghúlu</em> thus frustrated in his design, writes in
revenge to her father, and informs him that his daughter has
made a fruitless endeavour to seduce him: upon hearing which
the deceived parent orders her to be put to death. Her
brother is about to put this order in execution, when placing
his hand before his eyes while he inflicts the blow, he stabs
a small deer in lieu of his sister, who escapes into the
woods.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>With rapidity she fled to the woods, and then taking
shelter under a wide spreading <em>waríng'en</em> tree, the still
unripe fruits of the forest attained maturity, and seemed
to offer themselves as a relief to her.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Vol I Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>All the flowers, though the season for opening their petals
was not arrived, now expanded, and shedding their
fragrance, it was borne by a gentle zephyr towards her,
while the <em>bramára</em>, attracted by the odour, swarmed
around, and the fragrance of each flower seemed to vie
with the other in reaching her presence.</p>

<p>The wild animals of the forest, the tiger, the wild ox, the
rhinoceros came towards the princess, as if to watch and
guard her, crouching around her, but occasioning not the
least alarm.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Being in want of water, the princess put up a prayer
to heaven, when close by her feet a spring of pure water
issued.</p>

<p>On which the <em>sarója</em> flower soon appeared, opening its
petals, and offering the shade of a <em>páyung</em> to the smaller
water-plants floating beneath.</p>

<p>Her heart now became easy; and delighted at what she
beheld, she proceeded to bathe and perform her devotions.</p></div>

<p>The father, on his return, learns the treachery of the <em>Panghúlu</em>,
and having recovered his daughter, she is subsequently
married to a neighbouring prince, by whom she has three
children. Her trials, however, are not yet at an end, for being
on a journey to visit her father, accompanied by the <em>Pepáteh</em>
of her husband, who is appointed to guard her on the way,
the <em>Pepáteh</em> forms a design upon her virtue. He is represented
as saying:​&mdash;</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>"If you, oh princess, submit not to my desires, it is my
determination to put your eldest child to death."</p>

<p>The princess on hearing this became so affected as to be
deprived of speech.</p>

<p>When the <em>Pepáteh</em> again repeating his threat in a solemn
manner,</p>

<p>She replied, "what would you have me say? Whatever
may be the will of God I must submit. If my child
is to die, how can I prevent it?"</p>

<p>The <em>Pepáteh</em>, on hearing this, forthwith drew his sword,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Vol I Pg 444]</a></span>
and slew the child, again demanding of the princess
whether she would submit to his desires? To which she
answered, "No!"</p>

<p>He again urged her: but the princess hanging down her
head was silent, and in the hope that God would give
her resolution, her mind became more easy.</p>

<p>The <em>Pepáteh</em> then shaking his sword before the princess,
again urged her to submit, threatening that if she refused
he would slay her second child.</p>

<p>But the princess could only reply, "you must act as you
say, if it is the will of God that you should do so."</p>

<p>He then slew the second child, and again urging her to
submit, threatened, in case of refusal, that he would slay
the third child, then at her breast.</p>

<p>Snatching the child from her arms, he put his threat into
execution, and the blood flew on the mother's face, on
which she swooned and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The <em>Pepáteh</em> having succeeded in recovering her, again
attempted to effect his purpose, threatening that if she still
refused he would slay her: to this the princess at first
made no reply.</p>

<p>But placing her sole reliance on the Almighty, a thought at
last struck her, and she said:</p>

<p>"Do as you will with me; but seeing that I am disfigured
with blood, allow me first to bathe in an adjacent
stream."</p></div>

<p>The <em>Pepáteh</em> assenting to this, she went away and effected
her escape into the woods. There she remained in safety,
until discovered by her husband, who in revenge put the
three children of the <em>Pepáteh</em> to death.</p>

<p>It has already been shewn, that notwithstanding the intercourse
which has now subsisted for upwards of four centuries,
and the full establishment of the Mahomedan as the national
religion of the country for upwards of three centuries, the
Arabic has made but little or no inroad into the language;
and it may be added, that the Arabic compositions now
among them are almost exclusively confined to matters of
religion. Books in the Javan language are occasionally
written in the Arabic character, and then termed <em>Pégu</em>, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Vol I Pg 445]</a></span>
this practice is by no means general. The <em>Kóran</em> was first
translated, or rather paraphrased, about a century ago, and
rendered into Javan verse by a learned man of <em>Pranarága</em>,
to whom the title of <em>Kiai Pranarága</em> was in consequence
given.</p>

<p>Arabic books, however, are daily increasing in number.
The principal works in this language, with which the Javans
are at present acquainted, are the <em>Umul brahin</em>, by <em>Sheik
Usuf Sanusi</em>; <em>Mohárrar</em>, by <em>Iman Abu Hanífa</em>; <em>Ranlo
Taleb</em>, by <em>Sheik Islam Zachariah</em>; and <em>Insan Kamil</em>, by
<em>Sheik Abdul Karim Jili</em>. The doctrines of <em>Sheik Mulana
Ishak</em>, the father of <em>Susúnan Gíri</em> and one of the earliest
missionaries, were those of <em>Abu Hanífa</em>, which are the same
as the Persians are said to profess; but these doctrines have,
subsequent to the time of <em>Susúnan Gíri</em>, been changed for
those of <em>Shafihi</em>. There are, however, some who still adhere
to the doctrines of <em>Hánifa</em>; but their numbers are few, and
the chiefs are all followers of <em>Shafihi</em>. The number of Arabic
tracts circulating on Java has been estimated at about two
hundred.</p>

<p>Several institutions have been established in different parts
of the island, for the instruction of youth in the Arabic language
and literature. At one of these, in the district of <em>Pranarága</em>,
there were at one time (about seventy years ago, in
the time of <em>Páku Nagára</em>), not less than fifteen hundred
scholars. This institution has since fallen into decay, and
the number at present does not exceed three or four hundred.
Similar institutions are established at <em>Meláng'i</em>, near <em>Matárem</em>,
and at <em>Sídamârmar</em>, near <em>Surabáya</em>; and at <em>Bántam</em>,
about eighty years ago, there existed an institution, of nearly
equal extent with that of <em>Pranarága</em>.</p>

<p>Literary compositions are almost invariably written in
verse. The measures employed are of three classes. First,
the <em>sekár<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> káwi</em>, or measures in which the <em>káwi</em> compositions
are generally written; secondly, the <em>sekár sepoh</em>, high
or ancient measures; thirdly, the <em>sekár gángsal</em>, or five
modern measures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Vol I Pg 446]</a></span></p>

<p>A complete stanza is termed a <em>páda</em> (literally a foot); a
line is termed <em>ukára</em>; the long syllables are termed <em>gúru</em>, the
short <em>láku</em>; and although rhyme is not used, the several
measures of the <em>sekár sepoh</em> and <em>gángsal</em> are regulated by the
terminating vowels of each line, which are fixed and determined,
for each particular kind of verse<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>, by the number of
syllables in each line, the disposition of the long syllables, and
the number of lines in each stanza or <em>páda</em>.</p>

<p>Of the <em>sekár káwi</em> there are twelve radical stanzas, most of
which occur in the <em>Níti Sástra</em> and other principal <em>Káwi</em>
compositions. They are named:</p>


<ul><li>1. <em>Stradúla wikrindíta.</em></li>
<li>2. <em>Jága díta.</em></li>
<li>3. <em>Wahírat.</em></li>
<li>4. <em>Basánta tiláka.</em></li>
<li>5. <em>Bágsapátra.</em></li>
<li>6. <em>Srágdára.</em></li>
<li>7. <em>Sekaríni.</em></li>
<li>8. <em>Suwandána.</em></li>
<li>9. <em>Champáka máliar.</em></li>
<li>10. <em>Práwira lalítá.</em></li>
<li>11. <em>Basánta líla.</em></li>
<li>12. <em>Dánda.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these stanzas consists of four lines, as in the following
example of the <em>Sradúla Wíkrindita</em>, from the <em>Níti
Sástra Káwi</em>.</p>

<p>In order the better to illustrate the poetry and literature of
Java, and to exhibit the nature and spirit of the compositions
in the <em>Káwi</em>, I request to present the reader with an analysis
of the <em>Bráta Yudha</em>, the most popular and celebrated poem
in the language. Versions of this poem in the modern Javan
are common throughout the island, and the subject is the
theme of the most popular and interesting amusements of
the country.</p>

<p>The <em>Brata Yúdha Kawi</em>, of which the following is the
analysis, and from which the illustrations which are interspersed
are taken, contains seven hundred and nineteen <em>páda</em>
or metrical stanzas, of four long lines each, the measures
varying with the subject, so that most of the twelve <em>Káwi</em>
measures are to be found in it. Considering how little was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Vol I Pg 459]</a></span>
known on Java of the <em>Káwi</em> language, and how likely that
little was to be lost for ever, I felt a strong interest in
analysing and translating, as far as practicable, one of the
principal compositions in that language; and availing myself
of the literary acquirements of the <em>Panambahan</em> of <em>Sumenap</em>,
to whom I have already adverted, and of the assistance of a
gentleman of my family, and <em>Raden Saleh</em>, the son of the
regent of <em>Semaráng</em>, I have it now in my power to lay the
following analysis of this ancient poem before the public. It
is far from being as complete, or correct, as I could have
wished, yet imperfect as it is, it may serve to convey some
idea of the original. I have endeavoured to keep as close to
the original as possible, and have, in every instance, given
the interpretation of the <em>Káwi</em>, as far as it was understood by
the <em>Panambahan</em>. The Sanscrit scholar will probably find
imperfections, and possibly might be able to render a better
translation; but it is the <em>Káwi</em> language, as it is understood
by the Javans of the present day, that I am anxious to illustrate.
The original stanzas are given in the <em>Káwi</em>, and I only
regret that the limited knowledge of the language possessed
by the <em>Panambahan</em> himself, and my own want of time to
study and trace the grammatical construction of it, have not
admitted of my doing more justice to the original. I can
safely affirm, that independent of the interest which the subject
loses by translation into a foreign language, the illustrations
now given afford but a very imperfect specimen of
the beauty, sublimity, and real poetry of the original.</p>

<p>This celebrated work would appear from the <em>Chándra
Sangkála</em> included in one of the verses, to have been composed
by one <em>Puséda</em>, a learned <em>Pandíta</em>, in the year 1079.
Some copies, however, admit of a different interpretation
regarding the date, and the general opinion is, that it was
composed in 706 of the Javan era, during the reign of a
prince on whom was conferred the title of <em>Jáya Báya</em>.
Whether the poem was actually written on Java, or brought
by the early colonists, may be questionable; but the Javans
of the present day firmly believe, not only that the poem was
written on Java, but that the scene of the exploits which
it records was also laid on Java and <em>Madúra</em>. The annexed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Vol I Pg 460]</a></span>
sketch, with the subjoined note, will explain the situation of
the different countries, according to this notion<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.

to have been situated near the modern <em>Pakalong'an</em>; <em>Gendara Désa</em>, the
country of <em>Sanghoni</em>, near <em>Wiradesa</em>; <em>Amerta</em>, the country of <em>Derma
Wangsa</em> and the <em>Pandawa</em>, near <em>Japara</em>; <em>Talkanda</em>, the country of <em>Bisma</em>,
and <em>Banjar jung'ut</em>, the country of <em>Dursa Sána</em>, in <em>Lurung Teng'ha;
Awang'ga</em>, either near <em>Kendal</em>, or the modern <em>Yug'ga-kerta</em>; <em>Pring'gadani</em>,
the country of <em>Bima</em>, near <em>Pamálang</em>; <em>Purabáya</em>, the country of <em>Gatot
Kacha</em>, near <em>Surabáya; Mandura</em>, the country of <em>Bála dewa</em>, or <em>Kákrá
Sáná</em>, the western provinces of the island <em>Madúra</em>, and <em>Mandaráka</em>, the
country of <em>Salia</em>, the eastern provinces of that island, towards <em>Sumenap;
Diára Wati</em>, or Indoro Wati, <em>Krisna's</em> country, the modern <em>Pati</em>. In the
same spirit, the modern capital of the sultan of <em>Matarem</em>, called by the
Dutch <em>Djocjo carta</em>, but more correctly <em>Ayog'ya Kerta</em>, was so named by
its founder, about sixty years ago, after <em>Ayudya</em> the celebrated capital of
<em>Rama</em>.
</p>
<p>
There are three peaks in different parts of the Island, which still retain
the name of <em>Indra Kíla</em>, the mountain on which <em>Arjúna</em> performed <em>tapa</em>;
one on the mountain <em>Arjúna</em>, near <em>Surabáya</em>, one on <em>Morea</em> at <em>Japara</em>, and
another on the <em>Ung'arang</em> mountain, near <em>Semárang</em>.
</p>
<p>
At the foot of <em>Semiru</em>, the name of one of the highest mountains on
the eastern part of the island, is supposed to have been situated the
country of <em>Newata</em>, better known as the residence of <em>Detia Kewacha</em>, who
reigned before the war of the <em>Bráta Yudha</em>.
</p>
<p>
On <em>Gunung Práhu</em>, a range of lofty mountains inland between <em>Pakalungan</em>
and <em>Semárang</em>, are the remains of nearly four hundred temples, or
buildings, with the traces of an extensive city. This is supposed to have
been the burying-place of the ancestors of the <em>Pandáwa</em>, as well as of
<em>Arjúna</em>. The site of the temples was formerly called <em>Rah tawu</em>, the place
whence blood was washed, from a tradition, that when <em>Pula Sara</em> was
born, his mother immediately died, on which the <em>Déwa</em> came and received
the infant on its coming into the world.
</p>
<p>
In the performance of the <em>wáyang</em>, in which the heroes of these historical
romances are exhibited, the common people of <em>Jawana</em> never
exhibit that part of the history which relates to the juvenile days of
<em>Krésna</em>, from a superstitious apprehension, that the alligators would,
in such event, overrun the country, these animals being supposed to be
the transformed followers of <em>Kángsa</em>. At <em>Pamalang</em>, also, there is a
similar prohibition with regard to representing <em>Arímba</em>, the brother-in-law
of <em>Bíma</em>, under a dread, that if the <em>Dálang</em> should, by accident, not
represent the story with exactness, he would inevitably fall sick on the
first mistake.
</p>
<p>
The country of <em>Parakisit</em>, after the <em>Brata Yudha</em>, is supposed to have
been near <em>Semárang</em>, and on that account the <em>Dálang</em> will not perform that
part of the history which relates to his reign, although it forms a very
principal portion in the performances elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
To these superstitions may be added, that although with these local
exceptions the <em>wáyang</em> may represent any portion of the <em>Bráta Yudha</em>, or
of the preceding or subsequent histories of the same class, there is a prevalent
superstition, that a great war will be the inevitable consequence of
performing, at one sitting, the whole of this poem. It is gravely asserted,
that a chief of <em>Kendal</em> tried this experiment about fifty years ago, but that
the performance was no sooner completed, than his country was laid
waste and destroyed: and also that, previous to the Javan war, the
grandfather of the present <em>Susunan, Sida Langkungang</em>, ordered the whole
of the <em>Bráta Yúdha</em> to be performed at once; the consequence of which
was the dreadful war which ensued, and the dismemberment of the
empire.
</p>
<p>
These impressions and superstitions may seem to evince, how deeply
rooted is the belief that the scene of this poem was in Java.
</p>
<p>
The scene of the <em>Rámayan</em>, on the contrary, is not believed to have
been on Java; but there is an impression, that after the death of <em>Rawána</em>,
<em>Hánuman</em> fled to Java, and took refuge in the district of <em>Ambaráwa</em>, near
<em>Semárang</em>, on a hill called <em>Kandali Sáda</em>, the place named in the <em>Ramayan</em>
where <em>Hanuman</em> performed <em>tapa</em> (penance). There is still a post or pillar
preserved to distinguish this spot at the summit of the hill; and such is
the superstition of the neighbourhood, that they never perform the
<em>wáyang</em> representing any part of the history of <em>Ráma</em>, lest <em>Hanuman</em>
should pelt them with stones.
</p>
<p>
The annexed plate shews the situation of the principal places mentioned
in the <em>Bráta Yúdha</em>, according to the prevailing notions of the Javans.</p></div>

<h2>AN ANALYSIS<br />

OF<br />

THE BRÁTA YÚDHA,<br />

<em>OR HOLY WAR; OR RATHER THE WAR OF WOE</em>:<br />

AN EPIC POEM,<br />

IN THE KÁWI OR CLASSIC LANGUAGE OF JAVA.</h2>


<h3>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.</h3>

<p>The wife of <em>Santánu</em>, king of <em>Astína</em>, dying on giving birth
to <em>Déwa Bráta</em> (<em>Bísma</em>), <em>Santánu</em> asked <em>Pulásara</em>, the
<em>Prábu-Anom</em> (or younger prince), of <em>Wiráta</em>, and brother-in-law
of <em>Mángsah Páti</em>, prince of that country, to allow his
wife <em>Ambarsári</em>, who at that time had a child (<em>Abiása</em>) at
the breast, to suckle and so save the life of his infant boy
<em>Déwa Bráta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Pulasára</em>, offended at the proposal, went to war with <em>Santánu</em>,
but was afterwards persuaded by the <em>Déwa Sang yang
Naráda</em> to comply, on condition of <em>Santánu</em> resigning his
kingdom to him; to which <em>Santánu</em> agreed. <em>Pulasára</em>, when
his son <em>Abiása</em> was grown up, gave him the kingdom of <em>Astína</em>,
and turning hermit, went and passed the rest of his days on
the mountains.</p>

<p>By his wife <em>Ambalíka</em> (the old maiden daughter of <em>Baliétma</em>,
a hermit of <em>Gúnung Chámaragándi</em>, whom he was
forced to marry against his inclination) <em>Abiása</em> had three
sons, viz.</p>

<ol><li><em>Drestaráta</em>, who was blind.</li>

<li><em>Pándu</em>, whose head was inclined to one side.</li>

<li><em>Aria Widúra</em>, who was lame.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Vol I Pg 466]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Pándu</em>, the least exceptionable of the three sons, being
raised to the throne, <em>Abiása</em> turned hermit, and went and
passed the remainder of his days among the mountains.</p>

<p>On the death of <em>Pándu</em>, <em>Drestaráta</em> persuaded his father
<em>Abiása</em> to allow him to rule the country during the minority
of the <em>Pándáwa</em> (or five children of <em>Pándu</em>). These were
<em>Dérma Wangsa</em>, <em>Bíma</em>, and <em>Arjúna</em>, born of his wife <em>Déwi
Kúnti</em>, and <em>Nakúla</em> and <em>Sedéwa</em>, born of his wife <em>Déwi
Madrim</em>.</p>

<p><em>Drestaráta</em> however afterwards persuaded them to go to
a wild uncultivated place called <em>Amérta</em>, and establish a
kingdom there, furnishing them, for that purpose, with the
requisite implements, and a thousand men to enable them to
clear away and cultivate the country.</p>

<p>Through the assistance of <em>Mangsáh Pati</em>, the king of
<em>Wiráta</em> (uncle to <em>Abiása</em>), the country of <em>Amérta</em> was completed;
but not until the thousand men had all been devoured
by demons, of whom <em>Párta</em> was the chief.</p>

<p><em>Drestaráta</em> retained possession of <em>Astína</em>, and afterwards
resigned it to his sons, the <em>Kuráwa</em>, in number ninety-seven.</p>

<p>The hundred was completed by the addition of <em>Kérna</em>, the
son of <em>Déwi Kúnti</em> before marriage, by <em>Batára Suria</em>, and of
<em>Jaya-dráta</em> and <em>Aswatáma</em>.</p>

<p>The incarnate <em>Déwa</em>, <em>Krésna</em>, having been deputed by the
<em>Pandáwa</em>, whose part he takes, to propose to the king of
<em>Kuráwa</em> an equal division of the kingdom of <em>Astína</em> between
the <em>Kuráwa</em> and <em>Pandáwa</em>, and his proposal being rejected,
the <em>Pandáwa</em> go to war for the kingdom which was left them
by their father, and which in justice they ought to have had.
The <em>Kuráwa</em> are ultimately beaten, and the kingdom of
<em>Astína</em> recovered by the <em>Pandáwa</em>.</p>

<p>The scene of the poem lies chiefly in the hostile plains of
<em>Kuruksétra</em>, close to <em>Astína</em>, whither it sometimes shifts.
The time of it is about a month, the same being the fifth of
the year.

<p>139. [Vexed and enraged at the death of his son,
<em>Mángsah Páti</em> makes a furious and desperate attack upon the
enemy. The <em>Pandáwa</em>, too, heedless of their lives, join and
support him.]</p>

<p>140-144. [The followers of <em>Bísma</em> are routed and pursued
with great slaughter. Night comes on, hostilities cease, and
the contending armies respectively withdraw. <em>Mangsáh
Páti</em> and his wife weep over the dead bodies of their three
sons slain in battle, and lament their misfortune in losing
them:​&mdash;they shake them and endeavour to call them to life.]</p>

<p>145. [They then burn the dead bodies on the field of battle
by the light of the moon.]</p>

<p>146-147. [The <em>Pandáwa</em> consult about the election of a
fit person to take the lead in battle. <em>Drestadriúmna</em> is appointed.
Morning arrived, the army of the <em>Pandáwa</em> is formed
into the terror-inspiring order of <em>kágeng-páteh</em>, or that of the
royal vulture. Situations of the different princes and chiefs
detailed.]</p>

<p>148-151. [<em>Suyudána</em> causes the army of the <em>Kuráwa</em> to
be formed into a similar order. The battle rages. The different
chiefs, on either side, who engage each other.]</p>

<p>152-153. [The dust stirred up fills and darkens the air.
The dust clearing away, the field of battle appears like a sea
of blood, in which the carcases of elephants, horses, and men,
with the fragments of chariots, weapons, &amp;c. resemble so
many rocks and stones.]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Vol I Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p>154-156. [<em>Bísma</em> beheld with delight and admiration by
all the chiefs and people of <em>Kuráwa</em>, distinguishes himself by
his prowess. He engages <em>Arjúna</em>, and shoots ten arrows for
every one discharged by him.]</p>

<p>157. [<em>Ráwan</em>, the son of <em>Arjúna</em>, is killed by the <em>Rasáksa
Séreng'gi</em>.]</p>

<p>158-159. [<em>Krésna</em>, enraged at <em>Bísma</em>, descends from his
chariot and is going to shoot at him, when <em>Bísma</em> evinces his
ready willingness to be killed by <em>Krésna's chákra</em>, and so gain
admittance to his heaven.]</p>

<p>160. [<em>Arjúna</em> then descends from the chariot, and dissuades
<em>Krésna</em> from killing <em>Bísma</em>.]</p>

<p>161. [<em>Krésna</em> and <em>Arjúna</em> both re-ascend the chariot, while
<em>Bísma</em> remains deprived of all his strength, in consequence of
the fright he had undergone.]</p>

<p>162-164. [<em>Bísma</em> makes a sign to <em>Dérma-Wángsa</em>, who
recollecting that the former had made a surrender of his life to
<em>Arjúna</em> and <em>S'ri-kándi</em>, goes to them and tells them not to be
afraid, but to shoot at <em>Bísma</em>; whereupon <em>S'ri-kándi</em> discharging
an arrow, hits him in the breast. The arrow not having
penetrated far, <em>Arjúna</em> shoots, and drives it home with another
arrow. <em>Bísma</em> falls down in the chariot but is not killed.
His blood ascending to the regions above, is converted into
flowers, and in that form returns to the earth.]</p>

<p>165. [The <em>Kuráwa</em> fly and are pursued by the <em>Pandáwa</em>.]</p>

<p>166-167. [<em>Dérma-Wángsa</em>, <em>Arjúna</em>, <em>Nakúla</em>, and <em>Sedéwa</em>,
all go and kiss the feet of the respected <em>Bísma</em>; but the
haughty and unbending <em>Bíma</em> remaining in an angry posture,
makes no obeisance to the wounded <em>Gúru</em>. The <em>Kuráwa</em>
chiefs, with <em>Suyudána</em> at their head, wish to come up and
bow respectfully before <em>Bísma</em>; but seeing the stern <em>Bíma</em>
they are afraid to approach.]</p>

<p>168. [A truce takes place between the hostile chiefs, when
all shew their respect for <em>Bísma</em>. The <em>Kuráwa</em> wish to place
him upon a mat, but the <em>Pandáwa</em> insist upon his litter consisting
of arrows joined together.]</p>

offered him in a vessel by <em>Suyudána</em>, and calls to <em>Arjúna</em>,
who presents him with some in a quiver.]</p>

<p>170-171. [<em>Bísma</em> defers dying till the period of the sun's
greatest declination, which he reckons to be about seven
months off.]</p>

<p>172. [<em>Suyudána</em> appoints <em>Dangyang Drúna</em> commander-in-chief,
whereupon it rains blood.]</p>

<p>173. [The <em>Kuráwa</em> are too uneasy in their minds to go to
rest.]</p>

<p>174-177. [The following morning they go to battle.
Both armies are formed into the order of battle called <em>gája</em>, or
the elephant. A furious engagement ensues, in which many
are slain on either side. <em>Arjúna</em> destroys the order of the
<em>Kuráwa</em> army, is shot by <em>Bágadéta</em>, and afterwards brought
to life again by medicines administered by <em>Krésna</em>, when he
returns to the attack, and kills <em>Bágadéta</em> and the elephant he
is on. Many of the <em>Kuráwa</em> are killed by <em>Bíma</em> and <em>Arjúna</em>.]</p>

<p>178. [Night coming on the battle ceases. It was at the
eighth <em>pánglong</em> (or about the twenty-fourth) of the moon.
The <em>Pandáwa</em> regale themselves, while the <em>Kuráwa</em> lament
the death of <em>Bágadéta</em>.]</p>

<p>179-181. [<em>Dangyang Drúna</em> undertakes to kill <em>Dérma
Wángsa</em>, provided <em>Arjúna</em> and <em>Bíma</em> are out of the way. Ten
<em>Kuráwa</em> chiefs, with <em>Trigérta</em> at their head, draw away
<em>Arjúna</em> to fight against them to the south of the hills: ten
more, under <em>Dráta Púra</em>, draw off <em>Bíma</em>, in a similar manner,
to the north of the hills. <em>Krésna</em>, as usual, accompanies
and watches over the safety of <em>Arjúna</em>.]</p>

<p>182-185. [<em>Dangyang Drúna</em> forms his men into the
order <em>chákra-búhia</em> (or that of the circle with a well-defended
entrance). <em>Dérma Wángsa</em>, in his perplexity what to do,
calls upon <em>Bimányu</em>, the son of <em>Arjúna</em>, to attack and break
the order of the enemy. <em>Bimányu</em>, decoyed by <em>Suyudána</em>,
pursues him into the ring purposely formed by the enemy,
when it closes, and he is cut off from all assistance and support
from the <em>Pandáwa</em>.]</p>

<p>186-194. [<em>Bimányu</em> kills <em>Leksána-kumára</em>, the son of
<em>Suyudána</em>, but is overpowered by the number of the enemy.
His situation is described by many similes. He is slain.]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Vol I Pg 503]</a></span></p>

<p>195-196. [Night comes on and hostilities cease.]</p>

<p>197-199. [The effect which the death of <em>Abimányu</em> produces
on his wife <em>Déwi Sundári</em>. She adorns and prepares
to burn herself with the corpse of her husband.]</p>

<p>200. [His other wife, <em>Utári</em>, being eight months gone with
child, is deprived of this honour.]</p>

<p>201-205. [<em>Bíma</em> and <em>Arjúna</em> return victorious from their
respective engagements. The latter is angry with <em>Dérma
Wángsa</em>, for having caused the death of his son, but is appeased
by <em>Krésna</em>, and induced to treat the old man with
respect. <em>Dérma Wángsa</em> explains how <em>Abimányu's</em> death
was occasioned by <em>Jáya Dráta's</em> preventing the <em>Pandáwa</em>
from entering the ring of the enemy, and from his defending
it so well. <em>Arjúna</em> vows vengeance against <em>Jaya Dráta</em>, and
hopes that he himself may be killed and burned, if he does
not on the following day send him to the other world.]</p>

<p>206-207. [<em>Jáya Dráta</em> advised of <em>Arjúna's</em> intentions,
begs of <em>Suyudána</em> to be allowed to withdraw from the field
of battle. <em>Dangyang Drúna</em>, upon this, upbraids him, and
persuades him to remain and try his hand against <em>Arjúna</em>,
promising to support him.]</p>

<p>208-211. [<em>Arjúna</em> and <em>Krésna</em> consult together how
<em>Jáya Dráta</em> may be killed, and <em>Krésna</em> himself escape.]</p>

<p>212-213. [For this purpose <em>Krésna</em> makes <em>Arjúna</em> purify
himself and offer up prayers to the <em>Batára</em>. <em>Batára Sákra</em>
descends, and informs <em>Arjúna</em> that he will succeed in killing
<em>Jáya Dráta</em>, if he only makes use of the arrow called <em>pasopáti</em>,
and then vanishes.]</p>

<p>214-228. [The two wives of <em>Abimányu</em> talk much together
of the death of their husband. Their different situations
and feelings. Their separation, and meeting again under
various forms, &amp;c.; after which <em>Sundári</em> burns herself with
the body of <em>Abimányu</em>.]</p>

<p>229-231. [With the rising sun, the <em>Pandáwa</em> chiefs, &amp;c.
repair to the field of battle, where they find the <em>Kuráwa</em>
forces drawn up in the order <em>chákra báhui</em>, with <em>Jáya Dráta</em>,
for safety's sake, in the centre.]</p>

<p>232. [The diameter of the circle formed by the enemy
round <em>Jáya Dráta</em>, is ten times the distance at which men
can be distinguished by the eye.]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Vol I Pg 504]</a></span></p>

<p>233-235. [The <em>Pandáwa</em> observe the same order of
battle, and attack the <em>Kurawa</em>. Both armies mingle in close
and obstinate fight.]</p>

<p>236-237. [The <em>Pandáwa</em> being oppressed with thirst,
<em>Arjúna</em> strikes an arrow into the earth; whereupon water
springing forth, men and beasts drink and are refreshed.]</p>

<p>238-240. [<em>Krésna</em> makes <em>Arjúna</em> shoot at <em>Suyudána</em>,
whose chariot is thereby broken to pieces, and his charioteer
and horses killed, himself narrowly escaping with his life.
<em>Arjúna</em> and his men fight furiously, and kill many of the
enemy.]</p>

<p>241-244. [<em>Satiaki</em> kills <em>Tuyasáda</em>, <em>Kambujána</em>, and
<em>Sang Ambisúki</em>.]</p>

<p>245-252. [<em>Bíma</em> kills <em>Chitra Yúda</em>, <em>Jáya Suséna</em>, <em>Cháruchítra</em>,
<em>Durjáya</em>, <em>Jáya Chítra Séna</em>, <em>Chítraka</em>, <em>Sangupu
Chítra Derma</em>, and nine more chiefs.]</p>

<p>253-257. [<em>Burisráwa</em> opposes <em>Satíaki</em>. They fight, and
after their weapons are broken, they close and wrestle. <em>Satíáki</em>
is on the point of being killed, when <em>Arjúna</em>, at the urgent
request of <em>Krésna</em>, discharges an arrow at <em>Burisráwa</em>, which,
breaking his arm, causes him to drop the weapon with which
he was going to kill <em>Satiáka</em>. While <em>Burisráwa</em> and <em>Arjúna</em>
are expostulating with each other on their respective conduct,
<em>Satiáki</em> seizes the opportunity to dispatch the former. <em>Bíma</em>
and <em>Arjúna</em> slay thousands of the enemy, and endeavour to
get at <em>Jáya Dráta</em>, but are prevented by the numbers of the
<em>Kuráwa</em>, who rush in between and try to save him.]</p>

<p>258-259. [Seeing <em>Bíma</em> and <em>Arjúna</em> tired and nearly exhausted,
without the latter's being likely to effect the death of
<em>Jáya Dráta</em> within the promised time, <em>Krésna</em> has recourse
to an artifice. He discharges his <em>chákra</em> at the declining
sun, whereupon the clouds following the course of the weapon,
collect round and obscure the luminary, making it appear
like night. The <em>Kuráwa</em> thinking the fatal day past on which
<em>Arjúna</em> was to kill <em>Jáya Dráta</em>, triumphantly and insultingly
call out to <em>Arjúna</em> to fulfil his promise of meeting death and
being burned.]</p>

<p>260-262. [Taking advantage of the darkness, and of the
<em>Kuráwa</em> being off their guard, <em>Krésna</em>, accompanied by
<em>Arjúna</em>, wheels his chariot past the <em>Kuráwa</em>, till he reaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Vol I Pg 505]</a></span>
the spot where <em>Jáya Dráta</em> is. <em>Arjúna</em> then shoots at <em>Jáya
Dráta</em>, and kills him. <em>Jáya Dráta's</em> head being struck off
by the arrow, <em>Krésna</em> causes a wind to rise and carry it to
<em>Jáya Dráta's</em> father, who was doing penance in the mountains,
in order to obtain of the gods, that if his son was killed
in the battle, he might live again. In his surprise at beholding
the head, he inadvertently exclaimed that his son was
<em>dead</em>, which sealed his doom. <em>Krésna</em> then recalled his
<em>chákra</em>, whereupon the sun again shone forth before it went
down. Thus the vow of <em>Arjúna</em> was fulfilled.]</p>

<p>263-264. [<em>Suyudána</em> accuses <em>Dangyang Drúna</em> of being
the cause of <em>Jáya Dráta's</em> death, in not suffering him to retire
from the field of battle when he wished to do so. <em>Dangyang
Drúna</em> defends his conduct, and uses high words to
<em>Suyudána</em>.]</p>

<p>265-266. [<em>Suyudána</em> invites <em>Kérna</em> to go and attack
<em>Arjúna</em>. <em>Kérna</em> goes, and <em>Suyudána</em> with his men follow.]</p>

<p>267-271. [The sun sets and the battle continues. Enemies
and friends are with difficulty distinguished in the dark,
and many of the latter are killed by mistake.]</p>

<p>272-275. [<em>Sang Dwa jáya-ráta</em>, the adopted brother of
<em>Kérna</em>, is killed by <em>Bíma</em>. <em>Pratipéya</em> is on the point of killing
<em>Sangá sáng'a</em>, the son of <em>Satiáki</em>, but is prevented from
doing so by <em>Bíma</em>, by whom he himself is slain, after having
wounded <em>Bíma</em>.]</p>

<p>276. [The sons of the <em>Kuráwá</em> chiefs, exasperated at the
death of <em>Pratipéya</em>, all fall upon <em>Bíma</em>, but are every one of
them killed by that potent hero.]</p>

<p>277. [Three younger brothers of <em>Sakuni</em> are killed by
<em>Bíma</em>.]</p>

<p>278-280. [<em>Suyudána</em> talks with <em>Kérna</em> of the carnage
occasioned by <em>Bíma</em> and <em>Arjúna</em>. <em>Kérna</em> makes light of their
power, and engages to kill them both. <em>Krépa</em> accuses <em>Kérna</em>
of being a boaster, and intimates his inferiority in prowess to
the two hostile heroes, whereupon they are going to fight
with each other, when <em>Suyudána</em> interposes and prevents
them.]</p>

<p>281-284. [<em>Kérna</em> attacks the <em>Pandáwa</em> army and causes
great havoc. A consultation is held among the <em>Pandáwa</em>
respecting the fittest person to oppose <em>Kérna</em>. <em>Krésna</em> objects
to <em>Arjúna's</em> doing so, as being unskilled in fighting by night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Vol I Pg 506]</a></span>

To save the latter, <em>Dusasána</em> fires an arrow at <em>Bíma</em>

that shot him, he seizes him by the hair, and having
called out to all the princes and chiefs to bear witness to the
fulfilment of his promise, he tears him in pieces and drinks
his blood.]</p>

<p>477-479. [<em>Arjúna</em>, invited and challenged by <em>Kérna</em> to
shoot at him, in his turn tells him, if he wishes to save his
life to surrender and pay obeisance. <em>Kérna</em> refusing to do
this is shot in the throat by <em>Arjúna</em>: his head falls back into
the chariot. On the death of <em>Kérna</em>, the child of the sun,
that bright luminary grows dim with grief, and expresses his
deep sorrow by groans of thunder and showers of tears, while
his twinkling eyes emit incessant flashes of lightning.]</p>

<p>621-624. [The <em>Pandáwa</em> hear that <em>Suyudána</em> is in the
middle of the river: delighted, they repair to the spot. <em>Bíma</em>
calls him a dastardly coward afraid to die, and assures him
that his arm will reach him, whithersoever he may betake himself,
to the lowest depth of the earth or the highest region of
heaven.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Vol I Pg 520]</a></span></p>

Bíma that he betook himself to the river, not out of fear, but
for the purpose of making adoration to the gods, challenging
<em>Bíma</em>, or any other of the <em>Pandáwa</em>, to combat. <em>Krésna</em> represents
that <em>Dérma-Wángsna</em> is too peaceable and benevolent
to fight against <em>Suyudána</em>; that <em>Arjúna's</em> forte consists in
using the bow mounted in a chariot; that <em>Nakúla</em> and
<em>Sedéwa</em> are too young and inexperienced, and that <em>Bíma</em> is
therefore the fittest of all the <em>Pandáwa</em> to oppose <em>Suyudána</em>.]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Vol I Pg 522]</a></span></p>
<p>629-631. [<em>Kakrasána</em> is informed by <em>Naráda</em> of the
<em>Pandáwa</em> and <em>Kuráwa</em> forces being engaged, and withdraws
to see the issue of the contest. <em>Bíma</em> and <em>Suyudána</em> go and
make their respects to him, and each receives from him a
charm.]</p>

<p>632-639. [<em>Bíma</em> and <em>Suyudána</em> fight. Missing each
other, they strike and cut the earth, trees, and every thing
about them, without being able to hurt each other. They then
throw away their weapons, and closing, wrestle. So closely
are they united, that they seem to be one person and to have
one voice.]</p>

<p>640-656. [<em>Arjúna</em> repeatedly striking his hand on his
left thigh, reminds <em>Bíma</em> of <em>Suyudána's</em> being vulnerable in
that particular place only. <em>Bíma</em> recollecting the circumstance,
seizes his club and strikes <em>Suyudána</em> with it in his
vulnerable part. <em>Suyudána</em> falls, and expiring under the
blow is trampled upon by <em>Bíma</em>, who continues to insult and
triumph over him, till out of all patience with his relentless
and ungenerous conduct, <em>Kakrasána</em> seizes his spear and is
going to slay <em>Bíma</em>, but is withheld by <em>Krésna</em>, who says that
<em>Bíma</em> is not to be blamed for such just retaliation.]</p>

<p>657-667. [<em>Suyudána</em> dead, and night coming on, the
<em>Pandáwa</em> retire from the scene of battle to the city of <em>Astína</em>,
and there feast and rejoice, on account of their victory.
Satiated and fatigued with their revelling, all except <em>Krésna</em>
go to sleep. He alone remains awake, pitying in his own
mind the fate of <em>Suyudána</em>, and recollecting with feelings of
regret the indignant and unkind manner in which he was
treated by <em>Bíma</em>. Withdrawing by stealth, he goes to the
mountains, and wanders about oppressed with grief and much
agitated.]</p>

<p>668. [Next morning the <em>Pandáwa</em> missing <em>Krésna</em>, go in
search of him, and find him among the images on the hills.
Portentous signs take place. A raven croaks till blood issues

<p>669. [Next morning all these omens are gone.]</p>

<p>670-693. [News arrives from <em>Astína</em> of <em>Aswatáma's</em>
having entered the city by night, and assassinated <em>Drésta-dríumna</em>,
<em>Sérikándi</em>, and <em>Pánchakumára</em>, and of all the
<em>mántris</em> having fled for fear. Half are inclined to give credit
to the report, and half believe that it must have been the
spirit of <em>Sália</em>. The <em>Pandáwa</em> return to <em>Astína</em>, and find
the women there all in tears, and bewailing the loss of those
who had been murdered during the night. <em>Krésna</em> consoles
them, and reconciles them to what has happened.]</p>

<p>694-696. [<em>Krésna</em> makes the <em>Pandáwa</em> accompany him
in search of <em>Aswatáma</em>, whom they find among the hills.]</p>

<p>697-699. [<em>Bíma</em> is going to strike <em>Aswatáma</em>, when the
latter discharges an arrow at <em>Bíma</em>, and at the same time tells
him he is not a fit opponent, inviting <em>Arjúna</em> to contend with
him. <em>Arjúna</em> and <em>Aswatáma</em> fight, causing the earth and
mountains to shake, &amp;c.]</p>

<p>700-705. [<em>Sáng yáng Naráda</em> descends from above, and
tells <em>Arjúna</em> that they will cause the destruction of the world
if they continue the dreadful conflict. <em>Sáng yáng Naráda</em> at
the same time goes up to <em>Aswatáma</em>, and advises him to
desist from opposing the <em>Pandáwa</em>, as he will certainly be
beaten, and recommends his surrender and resignation to the
<em>Pandáwa</em> of his <em>pusáka</em> of <em>Chúda-manik</em>, also called <em>Chúpu-mánik
Estígéna</em>, a charm which gives its possessor the power
of getting eight different things.]</p>

<p>706-707. [<em>Aswatáma</em> refuses to give it to the <em>Pandáwa</em>,
but is willing to part with it to the unborn grandson of

directed should be called <em>Parikísit</em>.]</p>

<p>708-709.  [<em>Krésna</em> offers to bear witness to the promise;

and accomplishments, for which and for his character for
justice, wisdom, prudence, &amp;c. he is universally beloved, and

of <em>Batára Jáya Báya</em>. Under his wise and excellent administration
the kingdom of <em>Astína</em> flourishes, crimes are unknown,
and the inhabitants are happy. The neighbouring
princes of Java, who had survived the war, all acknowledge
the authority of the king of <em>Astína</em>, and pay homage to
him.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The musical instruments of the Javans are peculiar.
Several of them are necessary to compose a <em>gámelan</em>, set, or
band: of these there are several varieties. The <em>gámelan
salíndro</em>, which is the most perfect, consists of the several
instruments represented in the plate. In the <em>gámelan
pélog</em>, the instruments are much larger and louder; the
<em>bónang</em> or <em>krómo</em>, has sometimes only ten, and sometimes
as many as fourteen notes. Both of these <em>gámelans</em> are
employed as accompaniments to the <em>wáyangs</em>. The <em>gámelan
míring</em> partakes of the two former, and is employed to
accompany the <em>wáyang klítik</em>. In the <em>gámelan múng'gang</em>,
called also <em>kódok ng'órek</em>, from its resembling the croaking of
frogs, the <em>bónang</em> has fifteen notes, and the <em>kécher</em> resembles
the triangle: neither the <em>génder</em>, <em>salentam</em>, <em>sarón</em>, nor <em>chalémpung</em>
are included in this set; this <em>gámelan</em> is considered
the most ancient, and is played at tournaments, in processions,
&amp;c. In the <em>chára báli</em>, or <em>chára wángsul</em>, the <em>rebáb</em>,
or viol, is not used: in other respects the instruments are the
same as in the <em>salíndro</em>, except that they are as large as in
the <em>pélog</em>. The <em>gámelan sekáten</em>, which resembles the <em>pélog</em>,
except that the instruments are still larger and louder, is
restricted to the use of the sovereign, and seldom played,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Vol I Pg 525]</a></span>
except on great occasions, as during eight days of the festival
of <em>Múlut</em>. The <em>gámelan srúnen</em> is used in processions of
state and in war, being properly the martial music of the
country, in which, besides the ordinary instruments, a particular
<em>gong</em> and trumpets are introduced.</p>

<p>The plate will afford a better idea of the form of these
instruments than any verbal description. Most of them
resemble the <em>staccáto</em> or harmonica, and the sound is produced
by the stroke of a hammer. The <em>gámbang káyu</em> has
wooden plates, sixteen or seventeen in number: the <em>gámbang
gángsa</em>, of which there are several in each band, has metal
plates.</p>

<p>In the <em>génder</em> the metal plates are thin, of a different form,
and suspended by strings. The <em>gong</em>, represented (No. 9) in
the plate, is usually three feet in diameter. The <em>bónang</em>,
<em>kénong</em>, and <em>ketók</em>, are of metal, and are suspended
by tightened cords to favour the vibration. The <em>kécher</em>,
shewn in the plate, corresponds with the cymbal. The
hammers with which the larger instruments are struck are
either wound round at the end with cloth, or the elastic gum,
in order to soften the sound. The drum is struck with the
open hand and fingers only. The <em>chalémpung</em> is a stringed
instrument, with from ten to fifteen wires, which are sounded
with the finger, after the manner of the harp.</p>

<p>The person who leads the band performs upon the <em>rebáb</em>
(No. 17), an instrument which, having a neck, and two strings
pitched by pegs, is capable of producing perfect intonation
and a variety of sounds, by shortening the strings with the
pressure of the finger.</p>

<p>The <em>gámbang káyu</em> (No. 2) is a kind of <em>staccáto</em>, consisting
of wooden bars of graduated lengths, placed across a kind of
boat, which, when skilfully struck with a sort of mallet, produce
pleasing tones, either grave or acute. The lowest and
highest sounds of the instrument differ from each other by the
interval of three octaves and a major third: the intermediate
sounds of each octave from the lowest note are a second, third,
fifth, and sixth. This instrument is general throughout the
Archipelago, and is frequently played alone, or accompanied
only by the drum and a small <em>gong</em>. <em>Ráden Rána Dipúra</em>, a
native of Java, who accompanied me to England, played on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Vol I Pg 526]</a></span>
this instrument several of his national melodies before an
eminent composer, all of which were found to bear a strong
resemblance to the oldest music of Scotland, the distinctive
character of both, as well as of Indian music in general, being
determined by the want of the fourth and seventh of the key,
and of all the semitones<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>. By reiteration several of the
sounds are artfully prolonged much beyond their noted length,
which produces an irregularity of measure that might both
perplex and offend the educated ear of an accompanying
timeist. The rhythm of the sections (from extention and contraction)
appears very imperfect.</p>

<p>The <em>bónang</em> or <em>krómo</em> (No. 3) the <em>sáron</em> (No. 5) the <em>démong</em>,
(No. 6) and <em>selántam</em> (No. 7) are <em>staccátos</em> of metallic bars,
and a sort of bells placed on a frame. They contain a regular
dianotic scale, and nearly two octaves. These, however, are
never played singly, but harmonize with the instrument on
which the air is played.</p>

<p>The <em>gongs</em> (No. 9) are perhaps the noblest instruments of
the kind that have been brought to Europe: I am assured that
they are very superior to that which was admitted in the terrific
scenes of the serious ballet representing the death of
Captain Cooke. Suspended in frames, and struck by a mallet
covered with cloth or elastic gum, they sustain the harmonious
triad in a very perfect manner, and are probably the most
powerful and musical of all monotonous instruments. They
might be introduced with advantage in lieu of large drums.
They have the advantage of being mellifluous, and capable of
accompanying pathetic strains. The two <em>gongs</em> differ from
each other by one note.</p>

<p>The above observations apply particularly to the <em>gámelan
pélog</em>, which usually accompanies the recitation of the popular
poems of the country. The <em>gámbang káyu</em> of the <em>salíndru</em>
appears only to differ in being in another key, which is considered
better suited to the occasions in which that kind of
<em>gámelan</em> is used.</p>

<p>The airs which are exhibited in the plate are selected
from several written down by a gentleman at <em>Semárang</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Vol I Pg 527]</a></span>
as they were played on the <em>rebáb</em> of the <em>gámelan pélog</em>, and
may afford a further illustration of the nature of their
music.</p>

<p>But it is the harmony and pleasing sound of all the instruments
united, which gives the music of Java its peculiar character
among Asiatics. The sounds produced on several of
the instruments are peculiarly rich, and when heard at a distance
have been frequently compared to those produced on the
harmonic glasses. The airs, however simple and monotonous
they may appear of themselves, when played on the <em>gámbang
káyu</em>, or accompanied by the other instruments, never tire on
the ear, and it is not unusual for the <em>gámelan</em> to play for many
days and nights in succession.</p>

<p>The Javans do not note down or commit their music to
writing; the national airs, of which I have myself counted
above a hundred, are preserved by the ear alone. Those
which are exhibited in the plate are among the most popular:
but there are a variety which are played on occasions
of rejoicing and festivity, which it would be difficult to note
down; if, indeed, they can be called airs at all, the sounds
produced rather resembling the chiming of bells than a melody.
Thus, when a great man arrives at the native seat of
government, the tune of <em>kébu gíru</em>, "buffaloes frisking," is
played, and a variety of others of the same nature, which
diffuse the same kind of joy and gaiety among all assembled,
as the quick ringing of bells in the churches of England.</p>

<p>A complete set of the <em>gámelan pélog</em> costs from a thousand
to six hundred dollars (£250 to £400,) but second-hand sets
are frequently disposed of. The principal manufacture is at
<em>Grésik</em>, and the <em>gongs</em> in particular furnish a valuable article
of export. Every native chief in authority has one or more
<em>gámelans</em>, and there are more or less perfect sets in all the
populous towns of the eastern provinces.</p>

<p>In some of the interior, and in particular in the <em>Súnda</em> districts,
the inhabitants still perform on a rude instrument of
<em>bámbu</em>, called the <em>ángklung</em>, of which a representation is
given in one of the plates. This instrument is formed of five
or more tubes of <em>bámbu</em>, cut at the end after the manner of the
barrels of an organ. These, which are of graduated lengths,
from about twenty to eight inches, are placed in a frame, in
such a manner as to move to a certain extent from their posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Vol I Pg 528]</a></span>tion,
and to vibrate on the frame being shaken. A troop of
from ten to fifty mountaineers, each with an <em>ángklung</em>,
and accompanied by one or two others with a small drum
played with the open hand, always perform upon this instrument
on occasions of festivity in the <em>Súnda</em> districts. The
upper part of the instrument, and the parties themselves, are
generally decorated with common feathers, and the performers,
in their appearance and action, are frequently as grotesque and
wild as can be imagined. There is something, however, so
extremely simple, and at the same time gay, in the sound produced
by the rattling of these <em>bámbu</em> tubes, that I confess I
have never heard the <em>ángklung</em> without pleasure. The Javans
say the first music of which they have an idea was produced
by the accidental admission of the air into a <em>bámbu</em> tube,
which was left hanging on a tree, and that the <em>ángklung</em> was
the first improvement upon this Æolian music. With regard
to the music of the <em>gámelan</em>, "that," they say, "was procured
from heaven, and we have a long story about it."</p>

<p>A wind instrument, of the nature of a flute, but in length
some feet, with a proportionate diameter, is sometimes introduced
in the <em>gámelans</em>; but this is not usual in Java, though,
in <em>Báli</em> it is general.</p>

<p>The <em>trawángsa</em> is a stringed instrument, not very unlike a
guitar<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>, which is occasionally found in the <em>Súnda</em> districts: it
is by no means general. I recollect to have once heard an
old blind bard at <em>Chiánjur</em> play upon this instrument, reciting
at the same time traditions respecting <em>Pajajáran</em>, and the
ancient history of the country, which had probably never
been committed to writing.</p>

<p>The Javans have made no progress in drawing or painting;
nor are there any traces to be found of their having, at any
former period of their history, attained any proficiency in this
art. They are not, however, ignorant of proportions or perspective,
nor are they insensible to the beauty and effect of the
productions of other nations<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>. Their eye is correct and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Vol I Pg 529]</a></span>hand steady, and if required to sketch any particular object,
they produce a very fair resemblance of the original. They
are imitative, and though genius in this art may not have yet
appeared among them, there is reason to believe that, with
due encouragement, they would not be found less ingenious
than other nations in a similar stage of civilization. They
have a tradition, that the art of painting was once successfully
cultivated among them, and a period is even assigned to the
loss of it; but the tradition does not seem entitled to much
credit.</p>

<p>The Javans do not appear to possess any peculiar method
or system in their arithmetical calculations. They generally
compute without putting down the figures in writing. In
this process they are slow, but generally correct. The common
people, from an entire ignorance of arithmetic, or to
assist their memory, sometimes use grains of <em>pári</em> or small
stones on these occasions.</p>

<p>The many vast and magnificent remains of edifices found at
this day in different parts of Java, bear witness to the high
degree of perfection in which architecture and sculpture were
at one period practised in that island. But whether the
natives themselves designed these edifices and their ornaments,
or only worked under the direction of ingenious artists
from other countries, is a question connected with their history,
which we shall at present forbear to inquire into.</p>

<p>The art of sculpture is entirely lost to the natives. The
only modern buildings they possess, of any architectural importance,
are the <em>krátons</em>, or palaces of the chiefs, which have
already been described.</p>

<p>The Javans of the present day have no pretensions to astronomy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Vol I Pg 530]</a></span>as a science. The seasons are determined by reference
to a system no longer perfectly understood, either in its principle
or application; but from the Hindu terms still in use
for the days of the week, &amp;c. and from the similarity of many
of their superstitions to those of continental India, it seems
probable that if they ever possessed an astronomical system, it
was derived from that quarter. Thus when an eclipse takes
place, the people shout and make all the noise they can, to
prevent the sun or moon from being devoured by the great
<em>nága</em>, or dragon, which they suppose to be invading it. Some
of the better informed have derived a few notions of astronomy
from the Arabs; but their knowledge, in this respect, is at
best extremely imperfect, and it is rather to the traces which
are to be found in the ancient manuscripts, and to the remains
of what they knew in former days, that it is interesting to
refer.</p>

<p>The Javans, in common with other Mahomedans, have, for
upwards of two centuries, if not for a longer period, adopted
the lunar year of the Arabs; but they still retain their own
era, and seldom adopt that of the Hejira. The Javan era is
called that of <em>Aji Sáka</em>, on whose arrival in Java it is supposed
to have commenced; but as <em>sáka</em> is a Sanscrit term,
variously applied, as connected with the establishment of an
era, it was probably adopted by the Javans at the period of
the introduction of the era itself<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>, which corresponds almost
exactly with the Hindu era of <em>Salavaharna</em>, being seventy-four
years short of the Christian era. The present is accordingly
the year 1744 of the Javan era, or era of <em>Aji Sáka</em>. On
<em>Báli</em>, where the same era is likewise adopted, there is a difference
of about seven years, the <em>Báli</em> year being 1737. This
difference is supposed to have arisen from the people of <em>Báli</em>,
who are still unconverted to the Mahomedan faith, continuing
to use the solar year.</p>

<p>The Javans usually divide the day and night each into five
portions, as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="day and night">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="0" class="tdc"><em>Division of the Day.</em></td>

  <tr>
    <td>That from one o'clock till three</td>
    <td><em>língsir-wéng'i</em>;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>That from three o'clock till daylight</td>
    <td><em>báng'un</em>.</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>The twenty-four hours of the day and night are also occasionally
divided into what is called the <em>líma wáktu</em>, or five
periods of time, namely: from sunset until eight o'clock in
the morning; from that hour till twelve; from twelve till
three; from three till four; from four till sunset.</p>

<p>Each of these divisions is considered sacred to one of the
five deities, <em>Sri</em>, <em>Kála</em>, <em>Wísnu</em>, <em>Maheswára</em>, and <em>Bráma</em>, supposed
to preside over these divisions of the day and night in
rotation, the order being changed every day, until at the
commencement of every fifth day and night it returns to the
same again. The division which thus becomes sacred to <em>Sri</em>
is considered fortunate; that to <em>Kála</em> unfortunate; that to
<em>Wísnu</em> neither good nor bad; that to <em>Maheswára</em> as still more
fortunate than that to <em>Sri</em>; that to <em>Bráma</em> as peculiarly unfortunate.</p>

<p>The terms <em>páhing</em>, <em>pon</em>, <em>wági</em>, <em>kalíwon</em>, and <em>mánis</em> or <em>légi</em>,
are applied to the days of the <em>panchawára</em>, or week of five
days, which is common throughout the country, and by which
the markets are universally regulated<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Vol I Pg 532]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides this week of five days, which seems to be by far
the most ancient as well as the most generally adopted among
them, the Javans have a week of seven days as follows.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="week of seven days">

</table></div>

<p>The Arabic terms are usually employed to express the
months.</p>

<p>The weeks of seven days, considered with reference to the
seasons, are termed <em>wúku</em>. Thirty of these are said to have
been established in commemoration of the victory obtained
over <em>Wátu Gúnung</em><a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>. These thirty have again six principal
divisions, each consisting of thirty-five days, and commencing
on the day when <em>díti</em> and <em>páhing</em> fall together.</p>

<p>Each <em>wúku</em>, is dedicated to its particular deity, and has its
appropriate emblems in the Javan system of judicial astrology.
The names of the <em>wúku</em> and of the deities to which each is
considered sacred are as follow:</p>

<p>The twelve seasons, <em>Mángsa</em>, of which an account has been
given, when treating of the agriculture of the Javans, are said
to be determined by reference to the sun's course at the commencement
of each of these divisions.</p>

<p>When a want of rain is experienced, it is a custom for the
people of the village or town to assemble, and for a <em>wáyang</em> to
be performed upon the story of <em>Wátu Gúnung</em> and <em>Déwi
Sínta</em>. On these occasions two sticks of the dark coloured
sugar-cane, two young and two old cocoa-nuts, two bundles
of different coloured <em>pári</em>, two bundles of the flowers of the
<em>areca</em>-nut, a piece of white cloth, sweet scented oils, two fowls
and two ducks, are placed by the side of the <em>dálang</em> during
the performance, and are afterwards considered his property.</p>

<p>The term <em>wíndu</em> is used to express a revolution or cycle of
years. The Javans refer to <em>wíndu</em> of eight years, a <em>wíndu</em> of
twelve years, a <em>wíndu</em> of twenty years, and a <em>wíndu</em> of thirty-two
years. The <em>wíndu</em> of eight years, now in use, seems to
have been borrowed from the Arabs; but this is more frequently
considered of seven years, each year taking its name
from one of the following animals, according to the day of the
week on which it begins.

<p>The Javans, though they occasionally apply the signs of the
zodiac to the twelve years of the cycle, have at present no
knowledge of these signs as connected with the sun's course.
In the Chéribon manuscript, which contains an explanation
of each sign, they seem to have been considered only as giving
names to particular years. Thus in the explanations of
the first sign it is stated:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Vol I Pg 535]</a></span></p>
<p>"This year, the year of <em>Mesa-arsi</em>, there is a mark in the
horn of the ram; the deity who presides is <em>Batára Wisnu</em>;
the rain is for five months; it is profitable to plant <em>gágas</em>,
but birds destroy great quantities; this may be prevented by
administering <em>obat</em> (medicine) composed of the oil of the
<em>káwang</em>, with the flowers of the cotton plant and those of
the <em>kasúmba</em>; rats also do great mischief in the <em>sáwahs</em>,
which may be prevented by administering the <em>bud</em> of <em>síri</em>
on a lucky day, named <em>ang'gara</em>, and <em>diti</em> on the <em>panchawára
Mánis</em>; when administering it the following words
should be repeated; '<em>Hong! Kíro-Wísnu-Sówa! tung'gal
sih ning Buána!</em>' 'Hail Wisnu! who art beheld clearly
to be the only one in the world!'"</p>

<p>In the same manuscript, which appears to be entirely of an
astronomical or astrological nature, the year appears to be
divided into four portions, each distinguished by the peculiar
position of a <em>nága</em>, or serpent.</p>

<p>The first of the three divisions includes <em>Jista</em>, <em>Sáda</em>, <em>Kásar</em>;
the form and shape of the great <em>nága</em> in these seasons is first
stated, and represented by a drawing, the head being during
these months towards the east and tail to the west. "In
these months, if any one wishes to plant rice, it must be
white and yellow <em>pári</em>; and at this time alms must be
given, consisting of white rice ornamented with the flowers
called <em>wári</em>, and in the name of or in honour of <em>Déwa Yáma</em>,
and on the seventh day. It will not be profitable to go to
war in these months.</p>

<p>"If a child is born in these months he will be liable to
seven sicknesses through life. Great care and caution must
be taken in these months against sickness."</p>

<p>The second is as follows:</p>

<p>"In the seasons of <em>Káru</em>, <em>Katíga</em>, and <em>Kaphat</em>, the head of
the <em>nága</em> is to the north and tail to the west. These times
are neither good nor bad; it is proper to plant yellow <em>pári</em>;
alms should be given of <em>búbur ábang</em>, red rice and water,
&amp;c. in honour or in the name of <em>Déwa Sarasáti</em>. Success
will attend wars undertaken in these months.</p>

<p>"If a child is born in the month it will be unfortunate, and
great care and caution must be taken regarding it; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Vol I Pg 536]</a></span>
the child attains an advanced age, unhappiness will befal
the parent.</p>

<p>"In the third <em>nága</em>, which includes the fifth, sixth, and
seventh seasons, the head of the <em>nága</em>" it says, "is to the
west, his tail to the east, his belly to the north. The offering
then to be made is yellow rice, and a small ivory-handled
knife ornamented with gold. The deity of these
months is <em>Batára Sarastati</em>. In going to war in these
seasons, be careful not to face the head of the <em>nága</em><a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>."</p>

he has been kind enough to give the translation a poetical dress, and
I regret that the limits of the present volume do not admit of their insertion
in this form, in justice to the poetry of Java and the talent which he
has displayed. The following example of the last stanzas may serve as a
specimen of the style and spirit in which the task has been executed.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">603. Wearied with fruitless search, and in despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the object of her pious care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her murder'd lord, who on the battle plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay all neglected mid the thousands slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drew the dagger from its sheath of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent to plunge it in her heaving breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just then, as if in pity to her grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash'd the red light'ning to the maid's relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shew'd with horrid glare the bloody way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where her husband's mangled body lay.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">604. Another flash, indulgent from the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Points to the spot where <em>Sália's</em> carriage lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <em>Sália's</em> self, whom living she adored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bleeding body of her murder'd lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The richest flowers by heavenly influence shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sweetest odours o'er his honoured head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The muttering thunder mourned his early tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven in showers bewailed the hero's doom.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">605. With eager grasp the livid corpse she press'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In frantic wildness to her throbbing breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tried every art of love that might beguile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its sullen features to one cheerful smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kiss'd those dear lips so late of coral red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if unconscious that the soul had fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in her folded arms his head she rais'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long on those beloved features gazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With <em>síri</em>-juice his pallid lips she died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his wounds its healing balm applied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While with the skirt of her embroidered vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wip'd the blood-drops from his mangled breast.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">606. "Ah! then, my princely lord, whom I have found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bleeding and mangled on this cursed ground!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why are thy lips in sullen silence sealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To her who sought thee on this battle field?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wilt thou not speak​&mdash;my love, my lord, my all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Or still in vain must <em>Sátia Wáti</em> call!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Say, shall my copious tears in torrents flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And thus express my agony and woe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How shall I move thee, by what art beguile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The ghastly air of that unmeaning smile?"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">607. Thus soft and tender were the words she poured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To move the pity of her murder'd lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! no sound the unconscious dead return'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fire of love within his bosom burn'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While at each pause a death-like stillness stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the deep anguish of the mourner's soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And was it thus to bow thy honour'd head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Amid the thousands of the mingled dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That on that fatal morning thou didst glide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With gentle footsteps from thy consort's side?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And thus to reach the glorious realms above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Without the faithful partner of thy love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But earth has lost its fleeting charms for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And, happy spirit, I will follow thee!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">608. "Oh! meet and bear me o'er that fatal stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nor let me pass it, trembling and alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Though <em>Widadáris</em> shall obey thy call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yet keep for me a place above them all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To whom but me does that first place belong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who sought and found thee mid this ghastly throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And who, unable to survive thy doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thus sheds her blood and shares thy honour'd tomb?"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">610. Then with a steady hand the noble maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew from its peaceful sheath the gleaming blade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her fair bosom tore th' embroidered vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunged it deep within her heaving breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich was the blood that issued from the wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And streamed like liquid gold upon the ground.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">611. And while the ebbing tide of life remained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought and reason were a while sustained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She called her maiden with her feeble breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus address'd her from the arms of death.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">612. "Oh! when my spirit soars to realms above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Take this my last request to those I love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tell them to think of <em>Sátia Wati's</em> fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And oft the story of her love relate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Then o'er her woes the tender heart shall sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And the big tear-drop roll from pity's eye."<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">614. "Ah my lov'd mistress," cried the faithful maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In every scene by thee I gladly staid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whate'er the state of being thou must know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy faithful maiden will partake it too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What hand but mine the cooling stream shall pour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Or bathe the feet of her whom I adore?"<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">617. Strong in despair, and starting from the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drew the dagger from her mistress' wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With deadly aim she plunged it in her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with her mistress sunk to endless rest.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">618. Then did their happy spirits wing their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the fair regions of eternal day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The astonish'd shade of <em>Sália</em> linger'd there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne on the pinions of the ambient air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bid the object of his earthly love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An eager welcome to the realms above.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">619. Then in his arms his lovely bride he bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up that resplendent path he trod before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till earth and time had vanished all away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the splendours of eternal day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fields of light and silken mansions stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious work of a celestial hand.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">620. Th' enraptured princess, dazzled with the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed o'er the boundless realms of living light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heavenly fruit the eternal groves were crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy and rich profusion smiled around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All bore the bloom of an immortal youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All breathed alike the air of love and truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all adoring one eternal mind,​&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Almighty, rich in bounty to mankind.<br /></span>

design as their neighbours on Borneo, at the period of their being first
visited by Europeans. The following story is translated from a note in
Joao de Barros, 4 Decade, Book I. Chap. 17. "Vasco Lorenco-Drejo Cam
and Gonzala Veltoza, were sent to the King of Borneo on a treaty of
commerce. Among their presents was a piece of tapestry, representing
the marriage of Henry VIII. of England and Catherine, Princess of
Arragon. The king received them well, but on delivering the presents,
the piece of tapestry was displayed, with the figures as large as life.
This to the king was matter of alarm and suspicion, for he imagined
that the figures must be enchanted, and that the Portuguese wished to
introduce them under his roof to deprive him of his kingdom and his
life. He ordered the tapestry to be immediately removed, and that the
Portuguese should immediately depart, as he did not chuse to have any
more kings beside himself in the country; and all attempts to pacify
him were fruitless."​&mdash;Vol. IV. Part I. p. 107.</p></div>

<p>It has already been stated, that the established religion of
the country is that of Mahomed. The earliest allusion to
this faith made in the Javan annals is in the twelfth century
of the Javan era (A.D. 1250), when an unsuccessful attempt
appears to have been made to convert some of the <em>Súnda</em>
princes<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>. Towards the close of the fourteenth century,
several missionaries established themselves in the eastern
provinces; and according to the Javan annals, and the universal
tradition of the country, it was in the first year of the
fifteenth century of the Javan era, or about the year of our
Lord 1475, that the Hindu empire of <em>Majapáhit</em>, then
supreme on the island, was overthrown, and the Mahomedan
religion became the established faith of the country. When
the Portuguese first visited Java in 1511, they found a Hindu
king in Bantam; and subsequently, they are said to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1002" id="Page_1002">[Vol II Pg 2]</a></span>lost their footing in that province, in consequence of the
arrival and establishment of a Mahomedan prince there;
but with the exception of an inconsiderable number in some
of the interior and mountainous tracts, the whole island
appears to have been converted to Mahomedanism in the
course of the sixteenth century, or at least at the period of
the establishment of the Dutch at Batavia in 1620.</p>

<p>The natives are still devotedly attached to their ancient
institutions, and though they have long ceased to respect the
temples and idols of a former worship, they still retain a high
respect for the laws, usages, and national observances which
prevailed before the introduction of Mahomedanism. And
although some few individuals among them may aspire to a
higher sanctity and closer conformity to Mahomedanism than
others, it may be fairly stated, that the Javans in general,
while they believe in one supreme God, and that Mahomed
was his Prophet, and observe some of the outward forms
of the worship and observances, are little acquainted with the
doctrines of that religion, and are the least bigoted of its
followers. Few of the chiefs decline the use of wine, and if
the common people abstain from inebriating liquors, it is not
from any religious motive. Mahomedan institutions, however,
are still gaining ground, and with a free trade a great accession
of Arab teachers might be expected to arrive. Property
usually descends according to the Mahomedan law; but in
other cases, the Mahomedan code, as adopted by the Javans,
is strangely blended with the more ancient institutions of the
country<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1003" id="Page_1003">[Vol II Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Pilgrimages to Mecca are common. When the Dutch first
established themselves on Java, it was not unusual for the
chiefs of the highest rank to undertake the voyage, as will be
seen in the course of the native history. As soon, however,
as the Dutch obtained a supremacy, they did all they could
to check this practice, as well as the admission of Arab missionaries,
and by the operation of the system of commercial
monopoly which they adopted, succeeded pretty effectually.
It does not, however, appear that this arose from any desire
to check the progress of Mahomedanism on Java, or that it
was with any view to introduce the doctrines of Christianity,
that they wished to cut off the communication with Mecca;
their sole objects appear to have been the safety of their own
power and the tranquillity of the country. Every Arab from
Mecca, as well as every Javan who had returned from a pilgrimage
thither, assumed on Java the character of a saint,
and the credulity of the common people was such, that they
too often attributed to such persons supernatural powers.
Thus respected, it was not difficult for them to rouse the
country to rebellion, and they became the most dangerous
instruments in the hands of the native authorities opposed to
the Dutch interests. The Mahomedan priests have almost
invariably been found most active in every case of insurrection.
Numbers of them, generally a mixed breed between
the Arabs and the islanders, go about from state to state in
the Eastern Islands, and it is generally by their intrigues and
exhortations that the native chiefs are stirred up to attack or
massacre the Europeans, as infidels and intruders.</p>

<p>The commercial monopoly of the Dutch, however injurious
to the country in other respects, was in this highly advantageous
to the character of the Javans, as it preserved them
from the reception of many of the more intolerable and
deteriorating tenets of the <em>Kóran</em>.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned, that every village has its priest,
and that in every village of importance there is a mosque or
building set apart adapted to religious worship. The usual
Mahomedan service is performed; and the <em>Panghúlu</em>, or priest,
consulted, and decides in all cases of marriage, divorce, and
inheritance. He is bound also to remind the villagers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1004" id="Page_1004">[Vol II Pg 4]</a></span>
proper season for the cultivation of the lands. He is remunerated
by a tithe of the produce of the land, certain fees
which are paid on circumcisions, marriages, divorces, and
funerals, and presents which are usual at particular seasons
and on particular occasions.</p>

<p>In every chief town there is a high priest, who with the
assistance of several inferior priests, holds an ecclesiastical
court, and superintends the priests who are appointed in the
subordinate districts and villages. His emoluments consist
of a share, which varies in different districts, of the <em>zakát</em>
levied by the village priests, of fees of court, presents, &amp;c.
These chief priests are usually either Arabs, or descendants
of Arabs, by women of the islands. Their number in some
of the large towns is considerable; at <em>Pakalóngan</em> and <em>Grésik</em>
they have amounted to some hundreds. The village priests
are mostly Javans. On entering the profession, they adopt a
dress different from that of the Javans in general, wearing a
turban and long gown after the manner of the Arabs, and
encouraging, as much as possible, the growth of a few hairs
on the chin, as a beard. It is probable, that the total number
of priests is not less than fifty thousand, which forms a ninetieth
part of the whole population of the island.</p>

<p>In common with other Mahomedans, the Javans observe
the ceremony of circumcision (<em>sónat</em>), which is performed at
about eight years of age, and in a manner somewhat differing
from that usual in other countries. The ceremony is usually
attended with a feast and rejoicing. Girls, at the same age,
suffer a slight operation, intended to be analogous, and called
by the same name.</p>

<p>In their processions and rejoicings on religious festivals
and other occasions, the Javans are free from that noisy
clamour and uproar, which is usual with the Mahomedans of
continental India. The ceremony of <em>húsen hásen</em>, which on
the continent excites such a general noise throughout the
country, here passes by almost without notice, and the processions
of the Sepoys on this occasion, during the period of
the British government on Java, excited the utmost astonishment
among them, on account of their novelty, noise, and
gaudy effect; but nobody seemed inclined to join in, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1005" id="Page_1005">[Vol II Pg 5]</a></span>
imitate them: indeed the Javans have too chaste an ear to
bear with pleasure the dissonant sounds and unharmonious
uproar of the Indians<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<p>The Mahomedan religion, as it at present exists on Java,
seems only to have penetrated the surface, and to have taken
but little root in the heart of the Javans. Some there are
who are enthusiastic, and all consider it a point of honour to
support and respect its doctrines: but as a nation, the Javans
by no means feel hatred towards Europeans as <em>infidels</em>; and
this perhaps may be given as the best proof that they are
very imperfect Mahomedans. As another example of the very
slight hold which Mahomedanism has of them, may be adduced
the conduct of the reigning prince (the <em>Susúnan</em>) in
the recent conspiracy among the Sepoys serving on Java.
The intimacy between this prince and the Sepoys first commenced
from his attending the ceremonies of their religious
worship, which was Hindu, and assisting them with several
idols of that worship which had been preserved in his family.
The conspirators availing themselves of this predilection of
the prince for the religion of his ancestors, flattered him by
addressing him as a descendant of the great <em>Ráma</em>, and a
deliberate plan was formed, the object of which was to place
the European provinces once more under a Hindu power.
Had this plan been attended with success, it would probably
have been followed by the almost immediate and general
re-conversion of the Javans themselves to the Hindu faith<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1006" id="Page_1006">[Vol II Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever of their more ancient faith may remain in the
institutions, habits, and affections of the Javans, the island
abounds in less perishable memorials of it. The antiquities
of Java consist of ruins of edifices, and in particular of
temples sacred to the former worship; images of deities found
within them, and scattered throughout the country, either
sculptured in stone or cast in metal; inscriptions on stone
and copper in ancient characters, and ancient coins.</p>

<p>The antiquities of Java have not, till lately, excited much
notice; nor have they yet been sufficiently explored. The
narrow policy of the Dutch denied to other nations facilities
of research; and their own devotion to the pursuits of commerce
was too exclusive to allow of their being much interested
by the subject. The numerous and interesting remains
of former art and grandeur, which exist in the ruins of
temples and other edifices; the abundant treasures of sculpture
and statuary with which some parts of the island are
covered; and the evidences of a former state of religious
belief and national improvement, which are presented in
images, devices, and inscriptions, either lay entirely buried
under rubbish, or were but partially examined. Nothing,
therefore, of the ancient history of the people, of their institutions
prior to the introduction of Mahomedanism, of their
magnificence and power before the distraction of internal
war and the division of the country into petty contending sovereignties,
or of their relations either to adjacent or distant tribes,
in their origin, language, and religion, could be accurately
known or fully relied on. The grandeur of their ancestors
sounds like a fable in the mouth of the degenerate Javan;
and it is only when it can be traced in monuments, which
cannot be falsified, that we are led to give credit to their
traditions concerning it. Of these monuments, existing in
great profusion in several places, and forming, if I may so
express myself, the most interesting part of the annals of the
people, none are so striking as those found at <em>Brambánan</em> in
<em>Matárem</em>, near the middle of the island, at <em>Bóro Bódo</em> in
<em>Kédu</em>, on <em>Gúnung Práhu</em> and its vicinity, in <em>Kedírí</em>, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1007" id="Page_1007">[Vol II Pg 7]</a></span><em>Sing'a Sári</em> in the district of <em>Málang</em>, in the eastern part of
the island.</p>

<p>In addition to their claims on the consideration of the
antiquarian, the ruins at two of these places, <em>Brambánan</em>
and <em>Bóro Bódo</em>, are admirable as majestic works of art. The
great extent of the masses of building covered in some parts
with the luxuriant vegetation of the climate, the beauty and
delicate execution of the separate portions, the symmetry and
regularity of the whole, the great number and interesting
character of the statues and bas-reliefs, with which they are
ornamented, excite our wonder that they were not earlier
examined, sketched, and described.</p>

<p>With respect to the ruins at <em>Brámbanan</em>, we find, upon
the authority of a Dutch engineer, who in 1797 went to construct
a fort at <em>Kláten</em>, on the highway between the two
native capitals, and not far from the site of the temples, that
no description of its antiquities existed at that period. He
found great difficulty in clearing away the rubbish and plants,
so as to obtain a view of the ruins and to be enabled to
sketch them. The indifference of the natives had been as
great as that of their conquerors, and had led them to neglect
the works of their ancestors which they could not imitate.
They had allowed a powerful vegetation, not only to cover
the surface of the buildings, but to dislocate and almost to
overthrow them. They still viewed with veneration, however,
the most conspicuous statue in the ruins, and in spite of
their Mahomedan principles, addressed it with superstitious
reverence. The temples themselves they conceived to have
been the work of a divinity, and to have been constructed in
one night; but unfortunately this belief did not restrain the
neighbouring peasants from carrying off the stones of which
they were constructed, and applying them to their own purposes.
Enough, however, still remains, to shew the style of
architecture that was followed in their construction, the state
of sculpture at the period of their erection, and the nature of
the religion which then prevailed.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1812, Colonel Colin Mackenzie<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>,
so well acquainted with the antiquities of Western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1008" id="Page_1008">[Vol II Pg 8]</a></span>India, visited <em>Brambánan</em>, took an accurate survey of the
ruins, and sketched the fragments of the building, the architectural
ornaments, and the statues found there. His journal,
accompanied with much ingenious and interesting speculation
on the nature and origin of the worship indicated by
them, he kindly permitted me to publish in the seventh volume
of the transactions of the Batavian Society.</p>

<p>Considering it as a matter of importance, that a more extensive
and detailed survey should be made while we had the
best opportunity of doing so, I availed myself of the services
of Captain George Baker of the Bengal establishment, employed
in the provinces of the native princes, to survey, measure,
and take draughts of all the buildings, images, and inscriptions,
which this magnificent mass of ruins presented.
The following is an abstract of his report on the subject.</p>

<p>In the province of <em>Matárem</em>, and between the native
capitals of <em>Súra kerta</em> and <em>Yúgya kérta</em>, lies the village of
<em>Brambánan</em>, and at a distance of a mile from the high road,
there are hills which run east and west, for about a mile and
a half. On one of these, within about one hundred yards to
the south-east of the <em>Bándar's</em><a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> house, stands</p>


<h3>THE CHANDI KÓBON DÁLAM,</h3>

<p>but so covered with trees and shrubs, that it is not visible till
you are within two or three hundred yards of it. I could find
no remains of the ancient enclosure, but the fields for some distance
round have been enclosed in later days with the stones
which have fallen from the temple. About forty yards westward
of the temple, formerly stood two colossal images or
<em>réchas</em><a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, both now overthrown, and one broken in two: these
evidently faced each other inwards, as if to guard the approach.
Each of these, including the pedestal, is of a single block, seven
feet high; the head is two feet high; the square of the pedestal
about three feet, and its height thirteen inches and a half:
the stone block coarse grained, and apparently the same as the
outer coating of the temple. The door-way is three feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1009" id="Page_1009">[Vol II Pg 9]</a></span>and a half wide, and now ten feet long, so that allowing two
feet for dilapidation, the thickness of the walls must have been
more than twelve feet. This leads directly to an apartment
twenty feet square, the terrace of which, or original floor, is
now covered to an unknown depth with masses of stone fallen
from the walls and roof. The present height of the interior
of the building is about twenty-eight feet.</p>

<p>The roof is a square pyramid about fourteen feet high,
formed of stones which overhang each other like inverted
steps. The stone composing the interior of the apartment is
whitish and close grained, and breaks in flakes something like
flint. The whole is uniformly cut and neatly morticed together
without cement. The interior is perfectly plain, the exterior
could never have possessed more than the simplest architectural
embellishment.</p>

<p>Excepting the two <em>réchas</em>, or porters, I saw no remains of statuary;
but it is probable that images of Hindu deities lie buried
in the rubbish. These porters or giants seem to have been
posted as if to guard the approach to the sanctuaries of the
gods. The hair of each is plaited and wound round his head,
after the fashion of the mendicant priests of India. He wears
large cylindrical ear-rings, like those of the Javan women,
bracelets and necklace of beads. His waistband, which is
very bulky and reaches almost to his knees, is confined by a
chain of square links, and receives on the right side a small
square-hilted dagger. Between his legs and under the waistband
there passes a <em>lungofa</em> or <em>kopina</em>, the ends of which hang
down before and behind. In his right hand he holds an octagonal
club; in his left a snake, coiled and darting its tongue
along the breast: small twisted snakes also form his armlets,
and one passes over his left shoulder diagonally across the
body, the head and tail forming a kind of knot. His head is
broad; his forehead and chin short but wide; his eyes quite
round, large, prominent, and staring; his lips thick; his
mouth open, and shewing two very large dog teeth and four
others of the upper jaw. Singular as the countenance is, it
has generally an open good humoured expression. The Sepoy
who attended me, and who had resided two years among the
Bramins at Benares, and, of a corps of upwards of eight
hundred Sepoys, was acknowledged to be the best acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1010" id="Page_1010">[Vol II Pg 10]</a></span>
with such subjects, informed me that similar figures were
common guardians of the entrance to the temples of India, and
seemed perfectly well acquainted with their history, purpose,
and distinctive accompaniments; but he was lost in surprise
at the number, magnitude, and superior execution of those at
<em>Brambánan</em>, to which he said that India could in no respect
furnish a parallel. Every thing here, he said, was manifestly
the work of the gods, as no human power could have effected
such things. The temples at <em>Brambánan</em> are entirely composed
of plain hewn stone without the least mixture of brick,
mortar, or rubbish of any kind, even in the most extensive
solid masses, or to fill up the floors and basements of the
largest structures. Large trees have made their way through
many of them, and give an air of high antiquity.</p>

<p>Close by the road side at <em>Brambánan</em>, and in front of the
<em>bándar's</em> house, there are several pieces of sculpture deserving
of notice. One is a very well executed relievo on two small
stones, of about eighteen inches by five, within the <em>bándar's
kámpung</em>: it represents elephants completely caparisoned in
the Hindu fashion. Another is a piece of sculpture representing
the wide-extended mouth and erect curled proboscis of the
elephant, having a figure (I believe of a <em>Gôpie</em> or inferior deity
or demi-god) seated in an erect posture on the animal's tongue,
surrounded with a formidable array of teeth. This is found on
either side of the top or bottom of flights of steps, grand entrances,
or portal of all the <em>Brambánan</em> buildings. There is
also a more finished specimen of the same kind as the last, but
having instead of a <em>Gópia</em> a lion, decorated with a necklace, to
whose head descends from the <em>lotos</em> flowers which crown the
elevated proboscis of the elephant, a very rich cluster of beads.
Two stones are sculptured in relief with the figures of seven
apes traversing a wood: they are each about two feet six inches
high by two feet wide. These pieces are more damaged
by time and weather than any others I met with, and perhaps
more ancient. They appear to be entirely historical, and probably
formed together the memorial of some legendary event,
which the learning of my Brahmin did not reach: he seemed
however positive that <em>Hanumán</em> was not of the number. The
shield occurs twice, a reptile of the lizard kind led by a string
once, and all the figures appear armed with sticks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1011" id="Page_1011">[Vol II Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The only other piece of sculpture found here is of a headless
naked figure, sitting on a double throne, surrounded with
foliage, opposite the <em>Bandáran</em> at the corner of a field. The
journal of Colonel Mackenzie, which had previously appeared
in the Transactions of the Batavian Society, had so fully persuaded
me that all these rude figures in a sitting cross-legged
posture were <em>Jain</em> or <em>Budhist</em>, that I by accident only asked
my companion if he knew what this was? To my astonishment
he replied, that this, with all other similar images, were
<em>tupís wurri</em>, or Hindus in the act of devotion, and that this
figure was evidently a Brahmin (from the sacrificial or sacred
string over his left shoulder) employed in <em>tupísya</em>. I asked
him whether it might be <em>Budh</em>? to which he replied, No;
that <em>Budh</em> held a very low rank in the estimation of the
Brahmins, who, in consequence of the schism between Brahmins
and Budhists, did not choose to make <em>tupísya</em> before
him, or erect his likeness in their temples; and that, as all
the temples at <em>Brambánan</em> were entirely Braminical, or had
their origin from the same sect of which he himself was a
member, it was not likely that any images of <em>Budh</em> should be
found thereabouts. When we afterwards came to examine
the temples at <em>Lóro Jóngran</em> and other places, where the
same figure complete appears seated in the small temples,
surrounding the great central one, I pointed out to him the
long-extended ears, short curled head of hair, and other marks,
which I had understood served to distinguish the <em>Jain</em> or
<em>Budh</em> images from all others. He said he was only more convinced
that they were all simple Hindu devotees in the act of
making <em>tupísya</em>, in the presence of the principal deity enthroned
in the grand temple in the midst of them; that this
was frequently the case in India, and wherever practicable
the Brahmins placed images of devotees, of exactly similar
form and attitude, around the fanes of Brahma and their inferior
gods; that what I called curled hair was nothing more
than a peculiar kind of cap (<em>topi</em> he called it) worn by devotees
when in the most sacred acts of <em>tupísya</em>, which caps
are common, he said, throughout Bengal or Hindustan, and
are made for the purpose, by a particular class of people. I
found the lower part of two counterpart decorated stones, having
the part of the body of <em>Ganésa</em> in the centre of each.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1012" id="Page_1012">[Vol II Pg 12]</a></span>
They were extremely well executed and in good preservation.</p>


<h3>CHÁNDI LÓRO JÓNGRANG; or TEMPLES OF LÓRO JÓNGRAN.</h3>

<p>These lie directly in front (north) of the village of <em>Brambánan</em>,
and about two hundred and fifty yards from the road,
whence they are visible, in the form of large hillocks of fallen
masses of stone, surmounted, and in some instances covered,
with a profusion of trees and herbage of all descriptions. In
the present dilapidated state of these venerable buildings, I
found it very difficult to obtain a correct plan or description
of their original disposition, extent, or even of their number
and figure. Those that remain, with any degree of their
primary form or elevation, are ten, disposed in three lines,
running north and south. Of those on the western line, which
are far the largest and most lofty, that in the centre towers
high above the rest, and its jutting fragments lie tumbled
about over a large area. Nothing can exceed the air of desolation
which this spot presents; and the feelings of every
visitor are attuned, by the scene of surrounding devastation,
to reflect, that while these noble monuments of the ancient
splendour of religion and the arts are submitting, with sullen
slowness, to the destructive hand of time and nature, the
art which raised them has perished before them, and the
faith which they were to honour has now no other honour in
the land.</p>

<p>After repeated visits to the place, I am perfectly clear, that the
temples of <em>Jongrángan</em> originally consisted of twenty separate
buildings, besides the enclosures and gateway; that of these,
six large and two small temples were within the second wall,
and twelve small ones, exactly similar to each other, formed
a kind of square about the exterior of the inner wall. The
first temple that occurs on entering, is the small central one on
the right hand of the present pathway; and though its roof
is gone, a most beautiful terrace appears, which supported
the building, and measures twenty-three feet six inches by
twenty-two feet ten inches. At present the height of it is
barely three feet and a half. The lower part contains five
small niches on either side, profusely decorated and resting
on small pilasters, each niche occupied by a lion, seated ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1013" id="Page_1013">[Vol II Pg 13]</a></span>actly
similar to those described in the elephant's mouth. The
intervals between the niches are very neatly filled with diminutive
pilasters and other ornaments, displaying real taste and
skill, which again support a double fillet projecting all round.
One carved most beautifully, with a running festooned beading,
with intermediate knots and pendents, each festoon filled
with a lively representation of a parroquet with expanded
wings, the other fillet with a fancy pattern more simple. On
the opposite, or north side, was a building similar to this, but
now a mound of stone.</p>

<p>The largest temple, apparently about ninety feet in height,
is at present a mass of ruin, as well as the five others connected
with it; but ascending to its northern face, over a vast
heap of stones fallen from it and the third temple, at the
height of about thirty feet, you reach the entrance: the whole
is of hewn stones, fitted and morticed into each other, without
rubbish or cement of any kind. Directly in front of the door-way
stands the image of <em>Lóro Jóngran</em>. I had previously
found a very similar, and I think a more beautiful representation
of <em>Dévi</em>, as the Bramin called it, in the village of
<em>Kuwíran</em>, about fifteen miles north-east from <em>Brambánan</em>.
The image of <em>Lóro Jóngran</em> here has exactly the same attributes
and accompaniments as that found at <em>Kuwíran</em>, but it
is larger, not at all damaged, perfectly smooth, and with a
polished surface: the buffalo is entirely recumbent; the character
of the countenance, general figure, and attitudes, are
very different, and the shape, attitude, and visage of the goddess,
far less elegant and feminine. The figure at <em>Brambánan</em>
is six feet three inches by three feet one inch in the
widest part at the pedestal; that at <em>Kuwíran</em> is three feet
nine inches high by twenty inches. The general description
of this goddess, as read to me by the Bramin from a Sanscrit
paper he copied at Benares, will serve to illustrate both these
images, in the literal precise manner in which I took down
his words.</p>

<p>"<em>Bhawáni</em>, <em>Dévi</em>, <em>Soca</em>, <em>Juggudumba</em>, <em>Mahamya</em>, <em>Lutala</em>,
<em>Phulmuttis</em>, and <em>Mata</em>, are the designations of this powerful
goddess, who resides at <em>Shasi</em> or <em>Basini</em> (Benares), at an
angle of the sacred Ganges. Her adoration is called <em>urchit</em>
with oblations of flowers, <em>chundun</em>, <em>kundun</em>, and <em>mugt</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1014" id="Page_1014">[Vol II Pg 14]</a></span>
In her hand she holds a <em>tulwar</em>, called <em>khug</em>: round her
neck she has a <em>mala</em> of <em>sumpurun</em>, <em>toolsi</em>, or <em>chundun</em>.
Her weight is very great, and wherever her effigy is placed
the earth trembles and becomes much heavier. The name
of her buffalo is <em>Mahisa</em>, and the <em>Dewth</em> who attempts to
slay it is <em>Ussoor</em>. She sleeps upon a bed of flowers."</p>

<p>Thus much could I understand, and repeat verbatim of this
goddess's power and attributes. For the rest, in her eight
arms she holds, 1st. the buffalo's tail; 2d. the sword called
<em>khurg</em>; 3d. the <em>bhulla</em> or <em>janclin</em>; 4th. the <em>chukur</em> or <em>whut</em>;
5th. the <em>lune</em> or conch shell; 6th. the <em>dhat</em> or shield; 7th.
the <em>jundah</em> or flag; and 8th. the hair of the <em>Dewth Mahikusor</em>,
or personification of vice, who, while attempting to slay
her favourite, <em>Mahisa</em> is seized by the goddess in a rage.
He raises a <em>dhat</em> or shield in his defence, and a sabre, or
some offensive weapon, should be in his right hand.</p>

<p>The apartment in which this image and some other sculptured
stones are placed, rises perfectly square and plain, to
the height of ten feet, and there occurs a richly carved cornice
of four fillets, a single stone to each. From this rises
the roof in a square pyramid, perfectly plain or smooth, for
ten feet more.</p>

<p>Proceeding over the ruins round to the west face of this
building, you pass the intermediate angular projection, carved
alternately in a running flower or foliage, which Colonel
Mackenzie has called <em>Arabesque</em>, and with small human
figures of various form and attitude in compartments, above
representations of square pyramidal temples, exactly like
those on so many of the entablatures of <em>Bóro Bódo</em>, and
similar, I understand, to the <em>Budh</em> temples of Ava, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
the whole extremely rich and minute beyond description.
The western door-way is equally plain with the former, and
the entrance is still lower. The apartment is ten feet two
inches square, apparently more filled up (that is, the floor
raised higher than the other), but in all other respects exactly
the same. In front is seated a complete <em>Ganésa</em>, of smooth
or polished stone, seated on a throne: the whole a single
block, five and a half feet high and three wide. In his hands
he has a plantain, a circlet of beads, a flower, and a cup to
which the end of his proboscis is applied: a hooded snake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1015" id="Page_1015">[Vol II Pg 15]</a></span>
encircles his body diagonally over the left shoulder. His cap
is high, with a death's head and horned moon in front, and
as well as his necklaces, waistband, armlets, bracelets, anklets,
and all his habiliments, is profusely decorated. The only
damage he appears to have sustained, is in losing all but the
roots of his tusks.</p>

<p>The Javans to this day continue to pay their devoirs to
him and to <em>Lóro Jóngran</em>, as they are constantly covered with
turmerick, flowers, ochre, &amp;c. They distinguish <em>Ganésa</em> by
the name of <em>Raja Demáng</em>, <em>Singa Jáya</em>, or <em>Gana Singa
Jáya</em>. Going still round over heaps of fallen stone to the
south face, you with some difficulty enter by the door-way
(nearly closed up by the ruin) into the third apartment, where
there is scarce light enough to see a prostrate Siva with his
feet broken off and lost. What remains is four feet ten inches
and a half long, and two feet two inches wide.</p>

<p>The whole of the apartment on the east side has fallen in,
or is closed up by the dilapidation of that entire front.</p>

<p>From the elevated situation of the entrances to all the
apartments first described, it is evident that there must formerly
have been flights of steps to them. The plan of this
temple, and as far as I could judge of the two adjoining ones,
north and south, was a perfect cross, each of the four apartments
first described occupying a limb or projection of the
figure, and the small intermediate protruding angles between
these limbs of the cross could only be to admit of a large
apartment in the centre of the building, to which, however,
no opening was practicable or visible. Moreover, as all the
grand entrances to the interior of Hindu temples, where it is
practicable, face the rising sun, I could have wished to ascertain
from this (the largest and most important at <em>Jongrángan</em>)
whether or not the main apartment was in existence, as I
had made up my mind, that were I possessed of the means to
clear away the stone, I should have found <em>Brahma</em> himself in
possession of the place: the smaller rooms being occupied
by such exalted deities as <em>Bhawani</em>, <em>Siva</em>, and <em>Ganésa</em>,
scarce any other, indeed, than <em>Brahma</em> could be found presiding
on the seat of honour and majesty.</p>

<p>The three large temples on the eastern line are in a state of
utter ruin. They appear to have been very large and lofty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1016" id="Page_1016">[Vol II Pg 16]</a></span>
and perfectly square. The upper terraces, just under the supposed
entrances, were visible in some places, at the height of
about sixty feet.</p>


<h3>CHÁNDI SÉWU, or THE THOUSAND TEMPLES.</h3>

<p>In the whole course of my life I have never met with such
stupendous and finished specimens of human labour, and of
the science and taste of "ages long since forgot," crowded
together in so small a compass as in this little spot; which,
to use a military phrase, I deem to have been the head quarters
of Hinduism in Java. These ruins are situated exactly
eight hundred and thirty-five yards north-north-east from the
northern extremity of those of <em>Lóro Jóngran</em>, and one thousand
three hundred and forty-five yards from the high road
opposite the <em>bándar's</em> house. Having had in view all the
way one lofty pyramidal or conical ruin, covered with foliage,
and surrounded by a multitude of much smaller ones, in every
stage of humbled majesty and decay, you find yourself, on
reaching the southern face, very suddenly between two gigantic
figures in a kneeling posture, and of terrific forms, appearing
to threaten you with their uplifted clubs; their bulk is so
great, that the stranger does not readily comprehend their
figure. These gigantic janitors are represented kneeling on
the left knee, with a small cushion under the right ham, the
left resting on the retired foot. The height of the pedestal is
fifteen inches, of the figure, seven feet nine inches to the top
of the curls; total, nine feet. The head twenty-six inches
long: width across the shoulders, three feet ten inches. The
pedestal just comprises the kneeling figure, and no more.</p>

<p>The character and expression of the face I have never met
with elsewhere: it belongs neither to India nor to any of the
eastern isles. The countenance is full, round, and expressive
of good humour. The eyes are large, prominent, and circular;
the nose is prominent and wide, and in profile seems pointed;
the upper lip is covered with tremendous mustaches; the
mouth is large and open, with a risible character, shewing
two very large dog-teeth; the under lip thin, and the chin
very strait and short; forehead the same; no neck visible;
the breast broad and full, with a very prominent round belly;
the lower limbs, as well as the arms, extremely short and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1017" id="Page_1017">[Vol II Pg 17]</a></span>
stout. But the most extraordinary appendage of these porters,
is a very large full-bottomed wig, in full curl all over, which,
however, the Bramin assured me (and I really believe) is
intended to represent the usual mode in which the <em>Moonis</em> are
supposed to dress their natural hair; these gigantic genii,
whose duty it is to guard the sanctuaries of the gods, requiring
as formidable an appearance as possible. In other respects
the images are in the Hindu costume. The <em>lungota</em> passes
between the legs, the ends of it decorated, hanging down
before and behind, over the waistband, and a curious square-linked
chain, which encircles the waist. A snake entwines
the body diagonally over the left shoulder, the tail and head
twisted on the left breast. A small ornamented dagger is
stuck in the girdle on the right loins. A pointed club of an
octagonal form is held up in the right hand, and rests on the
knee; the left hand, dropped down his side, grasps a circled
snake, which seems to bite the fore-part of the left arm. The
necklace is of fillagree-work (such as is called <em>star</em>); and the
ears, which are large and long, are decorated with the immense
ornamented cylindrical ear-rings worn by the Javan
women of the present day. Round the two arms are twisted
snakes, and round the wrist bracelets of beads. The waistband
extends nearly to the knees. From the waist upwards
the figure is naked.</p>

<p>The same description is applicable to the eight other pair
of images, which guard the other approaches of <em>Chándi
Séwu</em>; at twenty feet distance from the exterior line of temples,
and facing inwards to each other about twelve feet apart.
Each of these statues and its pedestal is of one piece of a
species of pudding-stone, which must have required great
care in working.</p>

<p>The whole site or ground-plan of these temples forms a
quadrangle of five hundred and forty feet by five hundred
and ten, exactly facing the cardinal points. The greater
extent is on the eastern and western sides, as there allowance
has been made for wider avenues leading up to the grand
central temples situated within, while on the north and south
sides the spaces between the small exterior temples are all
alike. There is no vestige of an exterior boundary wall of
any kind. The outer quadrangle, which is the limit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1018" id="Page_1018">[Vol II Pg 18]</a></span>
whole, and which encloses four others, consists of eighty-four
small temples, twenty-two on each face: the second
consists of seventy-six; the third of sixty-four; the fourth
of forty-four; and the fifth, or inner parallelogram, of twenty-eight;
in all two hundred and ninety-six small temples, disposed
in five regular parallelograms. The whole of these are
upon an uniform plan, eleven feet and a half square on the
outside, with a small vestibule or porch, six feet two inches
long, by four feet and a half externally. Within is an apartment
exactly six feet square, with a door-way five feet nine
inches high, by three feet four inches wide, directly opposite
to which stands the seat or throne of the statue which occupied
the temple. The walls inside rise square to the height
of seven feet ten inches, and quite plain; thence the roof
rises about five feet more in a plain pyramid, and above that
a perpendicular square rises two feet more, where the roof is
closed by a single stone. The interior dimensions of the
porch or vestibule in front were three feet and a half by two
and a half. The thickness of wall to each temple was about
two feet nine inches, and of the vestibule one foot four inches.
The exterior elevation of each must have been about eighteen
feet, rising square to the cornices about eight or nine feet,
according to the irregularities of ground, and the rest a fanciful
superstructure of various forms, diminishing in size to
the summit, which was crowned with a very massive circular
stone, surmounted with another cylindrical one rounded off
at the top. The whole of each superstructure thus formed a
kind of irregular pyramid, composed of five or six retiring
steps or parts, of which the three lowest appeared to me of
the figure of a cross, with intermediate projecting angles to
the two lower, and retired ones to the upper step, which
varied in position also from the lower ones. Above that the
summit appeared to rise in an octangular form, diminishing
gradually to the stones above described. The same kind of
stone appears also to have been placed on the four projecting
angles of at least the lower part of the elevation above the
body of the building. I saw none that were complete; but
from the detached views I had of all, I think either nine or
thirteen similar ones were disposed at the various points of
the roof. Besides these, the roofs had little in the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1019" id="Page_1019">[Vol II Pg 19]</a></span>
decorations to attract notice, beyond a profusion of plain
cornices, bands, fillets, or ribands, forming a kind of capital
to the crest of each stage of the superstructure, and on one
of them small square pilasters cut in bas-relievo at intervals.</p>

<p>I have already stated, that the small temples appeared to
be all upon one uniform plan, differing however according to
their situation. The decorations, internal and external, are
alike in all, except that the interior niches are all variously
filled with the endless variety of Hindu mythology.</p>

<p>Proceeding inwards from the southern <em>récha</em>, and reckoning
from the centre, the distances are as follow: to the exterior
line of the outer quadrangle twenty feet; depth of these
temples, including porch, sixteen feet; space from thence to
the next line of temples eleven feet; depth of the second
quadrangle sixteen feet; thence to the third quadrangle thirty
feet; supposed depth of this line sixteen feet; thence to the
fourth quadrangle thirty feet; depth of the fourth quadrangle
sixteen feet; thence to the fifth or inner quadrangle thirty
feet; depth of the inner quadrangle sixteen feet; thence to
the bottom of the flight of steps leading up to the grand
temple fourteen feet; in all two hundred and fifteen feet from
the centre of the porters to the bottom of the steps. The
spaces between all the temples on the same line are about
twelve feet and a quarter, but on the east and west sides the
central avenue is larger. Between the inner quadrangle and
the central temple, at a distance of five feet from the bottom
step of it, runs a line of stone fourteen inches high, and two
feet four inches wide.</p>

<p>We now come to the great temple. You ascend from
each of the cardinal points by a flight of fourteen stone steps,
all rough hewn, and now mostly disjointed or displaced. The
length of each flight was about sixteen feet to the edge of
the upper step, the breadth eight over all, and the height
about ten feet, that being the elevation of the terrace of the
temple. The walls of this elevated terrace projected on
either side of the steps, so as to form with the walls that
received the steps three sides of squares, which the Sepoy
who was with me immediately said must have been intended
for small tanks, one at each side of every flight of steps, for
the devotees to purify themselves in before their appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1020" id="Page_1020">[Vol II Pg 20]</a></span>
at the shrine of the deity. On the third step from the bottom,
on each side of it, was a figure of <em>Hastu Singh</em> (or the lion
seated in the elephant's mouth), looking outwards and having
a very fine effect. The same figures, facing outwards, supported
each side of the four entrances to the vestibules. The
terrace has a breadth of three feet and a half, clear of the
walls of the temple all round, and as far as I could discern
in the ruin, following the angles of the edifice.</p>

<p>The form of the building, like that at <em>Lóro Jóngran</em>, is a
cross, with the same intermediate angular projection, in order
to afford room for the grand central apartment. Entering
from the east you pass through a portal, five feet eight inches
in width by five feet nine inches in length (which is the
thickness of the walls), into an outer vestibule, twelve feet
wide by ten deep. The walls of this vestibule are ornamented
with three niches, a large and two smaller ones, with
pointed arches, and all the profuse decoration of Hindu
architectural sculpture. In most of these niches remained
the throne of the inferior deities, who the Sepoy said must
have originally occupied them: not one was now to be found.
The throne was generally a single stone, decorated in front
with a vase and profusion of flowers, filling the whole space
in a natural easy manner. Leaving this room you pass on
through a door-way four feet five inches in width, and four
feet in depth (the thickness of the wall), but of uncertain
height, to a second vestibule, fourteen feet nine inches wide,
and four feet four inches deep. At either end of this vestibule
is a door, twenty-six inches wide in the clear, four feet two
inches deep in the passage or width of the wall, and barely
five feet and a half high, which communicates with the surrounding
terrace. This vestibule is perfectly plain, with the
exception of a raised spiral fluting, which surrounds the large
portal or gate leading into the central apartment, and terminates
near the bottom steps in the representation of the
elephant's mouth and trunk, simply cut in relief on the wall,
with no other addition but several strings of beads descending
from the top of his proboscis. The roofs of the vestibules
or limbs of the building, though entirely fallen, were originally
shaped like the Syrian, that is pointed and falling down to
the upper cornice of the walls, with a gentle double swell or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1021" id="Page_1021">[Vol II Pg 21]</a></span>
curve. The northern limb is an entire mass of confusion and
ruin; but the description just given of the double vestibule
on the east side of the temple, answers with a very trifling
variation of dimensions to those on the south and west, but
that instead of the large and spacious portal to be seen on the
east, there are five very lofty niches let into the main walls
about a foot, with pointed Indian arches, standing on square
pilasters of the same fashion, the capitals of each of which
are supported by a small, squat, doubled-up human figure,
having its arms embowed over its head, which my Cicerone
informed me was very common in the like situations in India.
He concluded also, that images of the gods had occupied the
niches in front against the main walls of the temple, on the
north, south, or west sides; but we saw not one, and only
the centre niches had even the thrones remaining. The
niches and pilasters are surmounted with a very deep elaborate
projecting cornice, crowned again with five representations
of small temples on each side, and immediately over
these are seen the two swells or curves of the original Syrian
roof.</p>

<p>So far we have gone on a level with the external terrace or
platform which surrounds the whole; but on the east side
you ascend by a flight of eight steps, at least six feet high,
through the spacious portal before mentioned, which is twelve
feet high from the top of these stairs, and six feet eight inches
wide in the clear, formed entirely of massive blocks of stones,
well squared. The depth of the passage or thickness of the
wall is ten feet. The top of the portal, which is flat or square
externally, surmounted in the centre with a very large and
terrible gorgon visage, changes with the ascent of the stairs,
in a very artful manner, to the pyramidal form, internally,
formed by the overhanging of the stones to resemble inverted
square steps closed at the top with a single stone. You thus
find yourself in the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>, the spot which has
rewarded the toil and zeal of many a weary pilgrim. My expectations
were raised, and I imagined I should find the
great and all-powerful Brahma seated here, in glory and majesty
proportionate to the surrounding splendour and magnificence
of his abode. Not a single vestige, however, remains
of Brahma, or of any other deity. The apartment is a plain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1022" id="Page_1022">[Vol II Pg 22]</a></span>
unadorned square, of twenty-one by eighteen feet. Four feet
from the eastern wall or door is a raised platform, three feet
and a half high, extending all across the room (north and
south), surmounted with a deep projecting capital or crest, to
ascend which are two small flights of six steps each, situated
at the extremities on either hand. The walls of this sanctuary,
to the height of about forty feet, rise square and plain,
and are composed of uniform blocks of greyish stone, well
squared, and fitting closely without cement, grooved into each
other, according to the general manner of all the buildings at
<em>Brambánan</em>. Above this is a projected cornice of three or
four stones, from which the roof assumes the pyramidal form
of overhanging stones, or inverted steps, to the height of ten
feet nearly; thence it rises perpendicular, plain and square,
for about ten feet more, and hence to the top in an octangular
pyramid of overhanging stones, approaching each other
gradually by tiers or layers, for nearly fifteen feet more, where
it closes finally with a stone, about two and a half or three
feet across.</p>

<p>The exterior of this great temple contains a great variety of
ornamental sculpture; but no human or emblematical figures,
or even niches in the walls, as in all the small temples surrounding
it. The capitals of the pilasters (as in the niches
against the body of the temple) are indeed supported by the
very diminutive figures before mentioned; but nothing further
appears in that way throughout the whole structure. The
style, taste, and manner of execution, are every where light,
chaste, and beautiful, evincing a fertile invention, most delicate
workmanship, and experience in the art. All the figures
occupying the niches of the smaller temples (and there were
thirteen to each of the two hundred and ninety-six) are a
wonderful variety of mythological characters, which the Brahmin
said figured in the Hindu legends.</p>

<p>Of the small temples, at least two-thirds are strewed along
the ground, or are mere ruined heaps of stone, earth, and
jungle. On the third quadrangle no more than six large heaps
of dilapidation remain: fields of palma christi, sugar-cane,
and tobacco, occupy the place, and many detached spots on
the site of the temples. Not one, in fact, is at all perfect:
large trees and many kinds of herbage have shot up and split<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1023" id="Page_1023">[Vol II Pg 23]</a></span>
them asunder. They are covered with the foliage which has
hastened or produced their destruction, certainly prematurely;
for the stone itself, even externally, and where it would be
most perceptible, on the sculpture, exhibits not the least token
of decay. The whole devastation is caused by a most luxuriant
vegetation. Towering directly over the temples the
<em>waríngin</em>, or stately banyan, is conspicuous, both for its appearance
and the extraordinary damage it has caused. In
short, hardly twenty of the temples give a satisfactory notion
of their original form and structure.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances it can hardly be supposed that I
examined the interior of many of them. Few could boast of
the original four walls alone; but within such as I did examine
I found only five of the original images occupying their
places. As these five, however, were found in points very
remote from, and bearing no relation to each other, and were
all exactly counterparts in size, shape, character, and general
appearance, I may safely conclude, that each of the two hundred
and ninety-six smaller temples contained a similar image.
Of these five, which are exactly the same with those Colonel
Mackenzie calls <em>Jain</em>, only one was perfect: the others had
lost their heads and received other damage in the fall of their
habitations; but all were manifestly intended to represent the
same figure. The Bramin maintained that these were all
<em>tupés-wurri</em>, or devotees, represented by the Braminical
founder of these temples in the act of <em>tupísya</em>, around the sanctuary
of the divinity himself, situated in the centre of them.</p>

<p>Returning from <em>Chándi Séwu</em> towards <em>Lóro Jóngran</em>, about
half-way on the left of the road, two hundred yards distant,
are the remains of a small assemblage of temples, which, on
examination, proved to consist originally of a small square of
fourteen temples, with a larger one in the centre. Five temples
were on the east and west faces, and four on the north
and south, including throughout those at the angles. The
only difference, however, between these temples and the small
ones of <em>Chándi Séwu</em> was, that they were rather smaller, and
the elevated terraces raised much higher, those of <em>Chándi
Séwu</em> not being a foot above the ground, while these were
raised nearly four feet, and had a small flight of steps and a
door-way inwards towards the middle temple. The exterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1024" id="Page_1024">[Vol II Pg 24]</a></span>
of all these buildings was perfectly plain, excepting a very
simple square pilaster and cornice surmounting it. The central
building alone possessed the very same kind of decorative
sculpture which is seen on those of <em>Chándi Séwu</em>, was about
twice the size of its neighbours, and about four feet larger
either way than those of <em>Chándi Séwu</em>, from which it only
further differed from having no porch. I shall only add to
this brief notice, that the whole site of this cluster seems comprised
in an area of eighty feet by sixty; that the spaces between
the temples of this quadrangle are equal to the extent
of each building; that only nine of the exterior temples, of
which one is a mere heap of stones, exist in any form indicating
their primitive order or position; and lastly, that no statuary
of any kind remains, to indicate the deity in whose honour
they were erected, except the relievos in the eleven
niches round the central building, which certainly seemed, as
the Bramin asserted, to be of the tribe of <em>Gopias</em>, or demigods
and goddesses, which occupy the walls of the two hundred
and ninety-six temples of <em>Chándi Séwu</em>.</p>

<p>The only name the Javans could give this assemblage was
the generic term <em>chándi</em>, or temples. The inclosures of the
surrounding fields attest the extent to which the farmers have
turned to account the devastations made by the <em>waríngen</em>
trees.</p>


<h3>REMAINS at DINÁNG'AN, or RÁNDU GÚNTING.</h3>

<p>Taking the road from <em>Brambánan</em> to <em>Yúgya kérta</em>, a little
beyond the seventh furlong, you arrive at an angle bearing
nearly south-west. At this angle, about sixty yards off the
road to the left, a very large statue is conspicuous, standing
close to the corner of the village of <em>Dináng'an</em>, which is behind
it. Searching about I found the broken scattered remains
of five other images exactly similar to it. Twenty
yards in the rear of the erect image, and just to the westward
of the village, a very extensive heap of blocks of hewn stone
(particularly large hollow cylinders intended to hold the water
used in ablution in India) intermingled with earth, points out
the site of what must once have been a spacious temple, long
since prostrate. The principal image is called by the Javans
<em>Béga Mínda</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1025" id="Page_1025">[Vol II Pg 25]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHÁNDI KÁLI SÁRI, or TEMPLE of KÁLI SÁRI.</h3>

<p>Returning to the angle of the road which I had left to inspect
<em>Béga Mínda</em> and his maimed and headless brethren,
and proceeding along the high-road, at a distance of little
more than two furlongs further, I crossed the small stream
now called <em>Káli Béning</em>, formerly <em>Káli Búhus</em>. A hundred
and twenty yards beyond this, having the village of <em>Káli
Sári</em>, which gives its name to the temple, close to the right
hand, you turn up a path between two hedges in that direction,
and at the south-western side of the village, about two
hundred yards off the road, you come upon the south-east
angle of a large and lofty quadrangular building, having much
the appearance of a two-story house, or place of residence of
a Hindu Raja. It resembles a temple in no point of view
even externally. It is an oblong square, regularly divided
into three floors, the ground-floor having in front a large door
between two windows, and on the sides two windows corresponding
to the others. The first floor appears to have three
windows in front, and two in the depth, answering to the
apertures below, and through the foliage which decorates and
destroys this monument of grandeur, may be seen several
small attic windows at intervals, seemingly on the slope of
the roof: these, however, are false, as the structure has but
the two floors and no other.</p>

<p>The external appearance of this edifice is really very striking
and beautiful. The composition and execution of its outer
surface evinces infinite taste and judgment, indefatigable patience
and skill. Nothing can exceed the correctness and
minute beauties of the sculpture throughout, which is not
merely profuse, but laboured and worked up to a pitch of
peculiar excellence, scarcely suitable to the exterior of any
building, and hardly to be expected in much smaller subjects
in the interior of the cabinet. It originally stood upon an
elevated terrace of from four to six feet in height, of solid
stone. The exterior dimensions of this building are fifty-seven
feet and a half by thirty-three and a half, measured
along the walls just above the terrace or line of the original
basement, which is divided obviously enough into three parts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1026" id="Page_1026">[Vol II Pg 26]</a></span>
by the centre projecting nearly a foot, and the general correspondent
composition or arrangement observable in each.
The door in the centre is four feet eight inches and a half
wide, surmounted with the wide-gaping, monstrous visage,
before described at <em>Chándi Séwu</em>, from which runs round each
side of the portal a spiral-fluted chord, ending near the bottom
in a large sweep or flourish, inclosing each a caparisoned
elephant in a rising posture; the space left over its hinder
quarters being filled with the face of a <em>munnook</em>, or human
being, all in the usual style of relief. At either side of the
door the original coat of stone has fallen, as far as the extremities
of the vestibule, which covered the whole central
compartment of the east or front of the building. In the
middle of each of the other divisions is an aperture or window,
nearly a square of eighteen inches, having a very deep and
projected double resemblance of a cornice beneath, resting on
the upper fillet of the terrace, while the same single projection
crowns the top of the window, surmounted with a more lofty
and elegant device of two elephants' heads and trunks, embellished
and joined in a most tasteful way, with a profusion of
other devices. On either side of the windows is a small double
pilaster, having a space between for the figure of a small
<em>garúda</em>, an effigy well known by the Hindus, which is human
down to the waist, and has the body, wings, and talons of an
eagle. Beyond the second pilaster, on each side of the windows,
is a large niche rising from the terrace to the cornice or
division between the upper and lower story. The niche is
sunk in the wall about four inches, and is formed by the adjoining
pilasters rising straight to their capitals, whence the
top of the niche is formed by a very beautiful series of curved
lines, leaving the point clear in the centre, which I can hardly
compare to any thing but rounded branches of laurel, or some
such foliage. This is crowned with a square projecting fillet,
which reaches the central cornice dividing the two floors.
Beyond the last pilaster of the niches, a single stone brings
you to the angle of the building, which is covered from top to
bottom with the running arabesque border, most delicately
executed. On entering the building, the mind of every one
must be fully satisfied that it was never constructed for, or
dedicated to, mere religious purposes. The arrangement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1027" id="Page_1027">[Vol II Pg 27]</a></span>
entirely adapted to the domestic residence of a great Hindu
chieftain or raja.</p>

<p>The whole building, within and without, was originally
covered with a coat of very fine chunam, or lime, about one-sixth
of an inch thick, of surprising tenacity.</p>


<h3>CHÁNDI KÁLI BÉNING.</h3>

<p>Pursuing the high-road from the spot at which you leave
it to visit the palace of <em>Báli Sári</em>, at the distance of about
three furlongs and a half, a lofty, massy pile is seen, about
one hundred yards off the road to the left. This ruin is of
the same general form and appearance as the larger temples
at <em>Chándi Séwu</em> and <em>Lóro Jóngran</em>, but on a closer examination
is found to be superior to the whole, in the delicate and
minute correctness of execution of all its decorative parts. It
is a cross, with the intermediate angles projected to give space
to a large central apartment, which is entered from the east
side only. The building is about seventy-two feet three inches
in length and the same in breadth. The walls are about
thirty-five feet high; and the roof, which appears to have
fallen in to the extent of five feet, about thirty more. Only
one front or vestibule is perfect.</p>

<p>On the south face is seen a small door, five feet seven inches
high, and three feet five inches and a half wide, situated in a
deep niche, which also receives in the recess above the door a
small figure of <em>Síta</em>, (as the Sepoy called it) in a sitting posture.
Beyond the door a small projection contains probably more
various elaborate specimens of the best sculpture, than were
to be found any where within a small compass, and on similar
materials. A very large and well defined monster's head projects
over the door, surrounded with innumerable devices of
excellent workmanship. I know not how to describe them,
nor the niche beneath, containing <em>Síta</em>, which, amongst other
accompaniments is supported by two small pilasters, the
capitals of which are upheld by the small naked figures before
described, under the generic term of <em>munnook</em>. The central
compartment of this southern limb (which is formed by the
niche and door below, and the gorgon head above) terminates
at the top in a point, by a gradual elliptical slope upwards
on both sides. These sides of the slope are filled, on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1028" id="Page_1028">[Vol II Pg 28]</a></span>
hand, with a succession of small naked <em>munnook</em> figures, all
seated on various postures on the steps formed for their reception,
along the edges of this ellipse, and closed by a similar
one above.</p>

<p>On either side of the door-way is a small niche, three feet
high and six inches wide, supported by small pilasters, and
filled with relievo figures of the fraternity of <em>Gópias</em> and their
wives. That occupying the niche to the right, my Cicerone
recognised to be <em>Krésna</em>. He was peculiarly happy to find
<em>Síta</em> seated over the door, which he declared to be a decisive
proof of the sense and devotional excellence of the founders of
this superb temple, which he very justly extolled, as far excelling
in sculptural beauty and decorations, any thing he had
ever seen or heard of in India, or could possibly imagine had
existence any where. This surprise and admiration at the
superiority of the Javan architecture, sculpture, and statuary,
over those of India, was manifest in every Sepoy who saw
them. Nothing could equal the astonishment of the man who
attended me throughout this survey at every thing he saw;
nor did he fail to draw a very degrading and natural contrast
between the ancient Javans, as Hindus and artists, and their
degenerate sons, with scarce a remnant of arts, science, or of
any religion at all.</p>

<p>The arch of all the niches is surmounted with a very lofty
and magnificent representation, in bas-relievo, of a grand
pyramidal temple, on a small scale, though superior in size,
and far more so in execution, to those at <em>Lóro Jóngran</em> or at
<em>Bóro Bódo</em>. Beyond these niches to the angles of the building,
are a series of pilasters, rising to the cornice, which surmounts
the whole face of each projecting vestibule. In the
centre, just at the point of each niche, is a gorgon head of the
usual aspect, which is surrounded by the lofty temples just
described.</p>

<p>The exterior sides of the vestibules occupy an extent of
eleven feet and a half, in the centre of which is a niche, much
larger and deeper than those in the front, being about six feet
high and two wide, and one deep in the clear, supported on
either side by a real Hindu pilaster, already described, and
the top of the niche surmounted with the gorgon head and
pyramidal temple, equally well known by description. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1029" id="Page_1029">[Vol II Pg 29]</a></span>
of these niches was formerly occupied with solid statues, I
imagine of <em>Gopia</em>. On either side of these single niches are
the same series of terminating pilasters (three in number),
which occur also on the fronts of the vestibules, of which the
centre one is a very magnificent running arabesque, from top
to bottom; the two others are plain without any variation.</p>

<p>A very fine coat of stucco, of excellent quality, covers the
whole exterior surface of the temple, and is made so to follow
the most minute and laboured strokes of skill on the stone underneath
it, as even considerably to add to their effect, particularly
in concealing the junction of the stones. The walls
are surmounted with a deep projecting double cornice. No
principal image was found in the temple or vestibules.</p>


<h3>REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT HALL OF AUDIENCE, &amp;c. AT
KÁLI BÉNING.</h3>

<p>The temple which I have just described stands close to the
north side of the village of <em>Káli Béning</em>, east of which is
the river of that name; and as I had never before heard of
any thing further in this quarter, I fancied my work was over.
I was, however, most agreeably surprised, on being told by
my Javan guides that there was something more to be seen
directly south of the village behind us. We accordingly
passed through it, and barely one hundred and fifty yards
from the temple, in a high sugar-cane and palma christi
plantation, we came suddenly on two pair of very magnificent
gigantic porters, all facing eastwards, each having stood
about twelve feet from the others. The pedestals of all these
statues are nearly covered, or rather entirely sunk into the
ground. The height of each figure, from the top of the
pedestal, is five feet one inch and a half, and breadth at the
shoulders three feet six inches. They are generally much
better executed, defined, and consequently more marked and
striking in their appearance, than those I had seen. The
countenance is much more marked and expressive, the nose
more prominent and pointed, the eyebrows meeting in a formidable
frown. The hair flows all round and down the back
in large ringlets and curls, and on the ankles, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1030" id="Page_1030">[Vol II Pg 30]</a></span>
beads, are the small circular bells common in India, under
the name of <em>googoor</em>. These figures are called <em>Gopolo</em>.
Behind the second pair of porters, or west of them, is a heap
of ruins of brick and mortar, which proved on examination
to be the remains of an ancient hall of audience or state,
originally standing on fourteen pillars, with a verandah all
round it standing on twenty-two pillars. The porters guarded
this building exactly in the centre of its eastern front: the
nearest pair scarcely thirty feet distant from it. The greatest
length of the building was east and west. The inner apartment
over all gave forty-seven feet in length, including the
pillars: the width of the hall was twenty-eight feet and
a half in the same way. A verandah, of twelve feet and a
half wide all round over the pillars, surrounded the hall.</p>

<p>It struck me forcibly, that the house at <em>Káli Sári</em> was formerly
the residence of some great Hindu Raja of Java; the
superb temple at <em>Káli Béning</em>, the place of his devotions and
prayers; this hall, a little south of it, that of state or audience,
perhaps also of recreation after his devotions. Other ruins
of brick-work, without any mixture of stone, were close by,
and perhaps served as out-houses.</p>


<h3>BÓRO BÓDO.</h3>

<p>In the district of <em>Bóro</em>, in the province of <em>Kedú</em>, and near
to the confluence of the rivers <em>Elo</em> and <em>Prága</em>, crowning
a small hill, stands the temple of <em>Bóro Bódo</em><a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>, supposed by
some to have been built in the sixth, and by others in the
tenth century of the Javan era. It is a square stone building
consisting of seven ranges of walls, each range decreasing as
you ascend, till the building terminates in a kind of dome.
It occupies the whole of the upper part of a conical hill,
which appears to have been cut away so as to receive the
walls, and to accommodate itself to the figure of the whole
structure. At the centre, resting on the very apex of the
hill, is the dome before mentioned, of about fifty feet diameter;
and in its present ruinous state, the upper part having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1031" id="Page_1031">[Vol II Pg 31]</a></span>fallen in, only about twenty feet high. This is surrounded
by a triple circle of towers, in number seventy-two, each
occupied by an image looking outwards, and all connected by
a stone casing of the hill, which externally has the appearance
of a roof.</p>

<p>Descending from thence, you pass on each side of the
building by steps through five handsome gateways, conducting
to five successive terraces, which surround the hill on
every side. The walls which support these terraces are
covered with the richest sculpture on both sides, but more
particularly on the side which forms an interior wall to the
terrace below, and are raised so as to form a parapet on the
other side. In the exterior of these parapets, at equal distances,
are niches, each containing a naked figure sitting
cross-legged, and considerably larger than life<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>; the total
number of which is not far short of four hundred. Above
each niche is a little spire, another above each of the sides of
the niche, and another upon the parapet between the sides of
the neighbouring niches. The design is regular; the architectural
and sculptural ornaments are profuse. The bas-reliefs
represent a variety of scenes, apparently mythological, and
executed with considerable taste and skill. The whole area
occupied by this noble building is about six hundred and
twenty feet either way.</p>

<p>The exterior line of the ground-plan, though apparently a
perfect square when viewed at a distance, is not exactly of
that form, as the centre of each face, to a considerable extent,
projects many feet, and so as to cover as much ground as the
conical shape of the hill will admit: the same form is
observed in each of the terraces.</p>

<p>The whole has the appearance of one solid building, and
is about a hundred feet high, independently of the central
spire of about twenty feet, which has fallen in. The interior
consists almost entirely of the hill itself.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1032" id="Page_1032">[Vol II Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Near the site of this majestic edifice was found a mutilated
stone image of <em>Brahma</em>, and at no great distance, situated
within a few yards of the confluence of the rivers <em>Elo</em> and
<em>Prága</em>, are the remains of several very beautifully executed
and interesting temples, in form and design corresponding
with those in the neighbourhood of <em>Brambánan</em>. In niches
and on the walls of these are designed in relief numerous
figures with many arms, evidently of the Braminical order,
most of them having their several attributes perfect. It
is remarkable that at <em>Bóro Bódo</em> no figures of this description
occur.</p>

<p>The image of the harpy (No. 1. of the annexed plate) was
taken from the temple at <em>Bóro Bódo</em> and brought to England:
it is of stone, in length about twenty inches, and exceedingly
well executed. The other subjects in this plate were not
found in this neighbourhood. No. 2 is a stone box about a
foot square, containing a small golden <em>lingam</em>: it was recently
dug up near <em>Málang</em> by a peasant, who was levelling the
ground for a cooking place. No. 3 and 4 are representations
of ornamental stone water-spouts, collected in the vicinity of
<em>Pakalung'an</em>. No. 5 is an ornamental corner stone, now
lying among the ruins of <em>Majapáhit</em>, the figure carved upon
which is nearly as large as life.</p>

<p>Next to <em>Bóro Bódo</em> in importance, and perhaps still more
interesting, are the extensive ruins which are found on
<em>Gúnung Díeng</em>, the supposed residence of the gods and demigods
of antiquity<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>. This mountain, from its resemblance
to the hull of a vessel, is also called <em>Gúnung Práhu</em>. It is
situated northward and westward of the mountain <em>Sindóro</em>,
which forms the boundary between <em>Kedú</em> and <em>Bányumas</em>, and
terminates a range of hills running east from the mountain of
<em>Tegál</em>. There are no less than twenty-nine different peaks of
this mountain, or rather cluster of mountains, each of which
has its peculiar name, and is remarkable for some peculiar
production or natural phenomenon.</p>

<p>On a table-land about six hundred feet higher than the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1033" id="Page_1033">[Vol II Pg 33]</a></span>
country, which is some thousand feet above the level
of the sea, are found the remains of various temples, idols,
and other sculpture, too numerous to be described in this
place. A subject in stone, having three faces, and another
with four arms, having a ball or globe in one hand and a
thunderbolt in another, were the most conspicuous.</p>

<p>The ascent from the country below to the table-land on
which these temples stood is by four flights of stone steps, on
four different sides of the hill, consisting of not less than one
thousand steps each. The ascent from the southern side is
now in many parts steep and rocky, and in some places
almost inaccessible, but the traveller is much assisted by the
dilapidated remains of the stone steps, which appear to be of
the greatest antiquity. Time alone, indeed, cannot have so
completely demolished a work, of which the materials were so
durable and the construction so solid. The greatest part of
this wonderful memorial of human industry lies buried under
huge masses of rock and lava; and innumerable proofs are
afforded of the mountain having, at some period since the
formation of the steps, been in a state of violent eruption.
Near the summit of one of the hills there is a crater of about
half a mile diameter.</p>

<p>At no great distance from this crater, in a north-west
direction, is situated a plain or table-land, surrounded on all
sides but one by a ridge of mountains about a thousand feet
above it. At some very remote period it was perhaps itself
the crater of a vast volcano. On its border are the remains
of four temples of stone, greatly dilapidated, but manifestly
by the effect of some violent shock or concussion of the
earth. The largest of them is about forty feet square: the
walls are ten feet thick, and the height about thirty-five feet.
The only apartment which it contains is not more than twenty
feet square, and has only one entrance. The roof is arched
to a point in the centre, about twenty feet high above the
walls, so that the whole building was almost one solid mass
of masonry, composed of the most durable cut stone, in
blocks of from one to two feet long and about nine inches
square. Yet these walls, so constructed, are rent to the
bottom. It was particularly observable, that little or no
injury had been done by vegetation, the climate being unfa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1034" id="Page_1034">[Vol II Pg 34]</a></span>vourable
to the <em>waríngen</em>, whose roots are so destructive
to the buildings of the lower regions. The entablatures
of these buildings still exhibit specimens of delicate and very
elegant sculpture. Several deep excavations are observed in
the neighbourhood. These, it is said, were made by the
natives, in search of gold utensils, images, and coins, many
of which have, from time to time, been dug up here.</p>

<p>The whole of the plain is covered with scattered ruins and
large fragments of hewn stone to a considerable distance. In
the centre are four more temples, nearly similar to those
before mentioned, but in a much better state of preservation,
the sculpture being in many places quite perfect. Numerous
images of deities are scattered about.</p>

<p>On a more minute examination of this plain, traces of the
site of nearly four hundred temples were discovered, having
broad and extensive streets or roads running between them at
right angles. The ground-plan of these, as far as it could be
ascertained, with sketches of the different images, ornaments,
and temples, which distinguish this classic ground, have been
made by Captain Baker, who devoted three weeks to the
accomplishment of this interesting object. At present I have
it only in my power to exhibit a drawing of one of the temples,
in the state in which it was found in 1815, with the same
temple restored to what it originally was.</p>

<p>The whole of the country lying between <em>Gúnung Díeng</em>
and <em>Brambánan</em>, in a line nearly crossing the central part of
the island, abounds with ruins of temples, dilapidated images,
and traces of Hinduism. Many of the villagers between <em>Blédran</em>
and <em>Jétis</em>, in the road from <em>Bányumas</em> through <em>Kedú</em>,
have availed themselves of the extensive remains to form the
walls of their buildings. In the enclosures to several of the
villages (which are here frequently walled in) are discovered
large stones, some representing gorgon heads, others beautifully
executed in relief, which had formed the friezes and cornices
of temples, all regularly cut so as to be morticed together,
but now heaped one upon another in the utmost confusion and
disorder.</p>

<p>Along the fields, and by the road-side, between <em>Jétis</em> and
<em>Mágelan</em>, are seen in ditches or elsewhere many beautiful
remains of sculpture, and among them many <em>yonis</em> and <em>lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1035" id="Page_1035">[Vol II Pg 35]</a></span>-gams</em>,
where they seem not only to be entirely disregarded by
the natives, but thrown on one side as if in the way.</p>

<p>Thee following is the account given by Dr. Horsfield of the
ruins found in the Eastern Provinces of the native princes, in
the year 1815.</p>


<h3>KEDÍRI, &amp;c.</h3>

<p>In the districts of <em>Jagarága</em>, <em>Charúban</em>, <em>Ráwa</em>, <em>Kalángbret</em>,
<em>Trengáli</em>, <em>Pranarága</em>, and <em>Magetán</em>, these antiquities
are dispersed solitary at occasional points, and consist principally
of images or <em>réchas</em>. The remains of buildings, and
of towns and cities, generally distinguished by the name of
<em>Kóta-bedáh</em>, are also noticed; but <em>Mádion</em>, <em>Kértasána</em>, <em>Kedíri</em>,
and <em>Sreng'át</em>, contain very important and interesting
antiquities.</p>

<p>In regarding them, the vicinity of the former capital of the
princes of the house of <em>Majapáhit</em> strikingly offers itself for
consideration; and a traveller perceives them to increase in
number, as he proceeds from the western to the eastern
districts.</p>

<p>Commencing my notices from the westward, I have to
point out in <em>Mádion</em> four monuments, or stones covered with
inscriptions: these, with several pedestals and other remains
of ancient buildings, have been collected and employed at
<em>Mauspáti</em>, the capital of <em>Mádion</em>, lately established by <em>Ráden
Ráng'ga</em>, the well known rebel of the <em>Yúgya-kerta</em> court. On
the largest of these monuments the characters of the inscription
are still in a great degree distinguishable, and these I
have carefully taken off; on the others, which are smaller,
the characters, although completely perceivable, are too much
obliterated by the decomposition and decay of the substance
of the stone to afford a copy. Besides these inscriptions; remains
of buildings, pedestals, and <em>réchas</em> of different sizes,
have also been collected from various parts of this province,
and employed to decorate a well and bath near the capital.
After a considerable interruption, which contains no remains
at present, I discovered, in a direction almost due east from
<em>Mauspáti</em>, in the district of <em>Anjóg</em>, a monument with an inscription,
in a more perfect state. In form this, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1036" id="Page_1036">[Vol II Pg 36]</a></span>
others, resembles the common tomb-stones of our burial
grounds, exceeding them only in size: its dimensions have
been carefully taken. Four sides are covered with characters;
two of these were in a state sufficiently preserved to be copied
with only occasional deficiencies. This stone was placed
near a <em>chándi</em>, of which the ruins only remain. It was two
stories high, built of elegant bricks, according to the usual
plan and distribution. In size, it nearly agrees with that of
<em>Jábung</em>, near <em>Probolíngo</em>. It is obvious, that both the dimensions
and the general plan of the numerous <em>chándis</em> found in
these eastern districts, built of these materials, are similar; at
least they do not exhibit that variety, both in size and distribution,
that is observed among the larger edifices built of
stone.</p>

<p><em>Anjóg</em> is connected in the east to <em>Kértasána</em>. In this province
I found two monuments covered with inscriptions, a
<em>kótah bedáh</em>, or destroyed capital, and various <em>réchas</em>. The
district of <em>Brébeg</em> has lately been separated from <em>Kértasána</em>.
The newly-appointed <em>Tumúng'gung</em>, in clearing and levelling
the ground for a dwelling and for a new capital, on the site of
the village <em>Brébeg</em>, discovered, by following the indication of
water oozing from the surface, in a slight concavity covered
by a wild vegetation, the remains of a bath, constructed with
neatness, and not without taste and art. The principal excavation,
which appears to have been employed as a bath, is
oblong, and about ten feet in length. Six small outlets or
fountains pour the water into it, which was conducted from a
rivulet flowing at some distance, by small canals cut of stone,
but bedded in a foundation of brick. The fountains discharging
the water are covered with sculpture in relief, tolerably
executed: one of these is a female figure pouring small
streams from the breasts. Adjoining to this bath are several
other reservoirs of water, included in the same square, and
receiving the supply by the same channels. Every thing is
constructed massy of regular and elegant bricks. The present
<em>Tumúng'gung</em> has collected, near this bath, many <em>réchas</em> and
other antiquities from various parts of the district: among
these was found one small inscription. Towards the foot of
mount <em>Wílis</em>, in a southern direction from <em>Brébeg</em>, I visited,
at the village <em>Ng'etos</em>, a <em>chándi</em> constructed of brick, and still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1037" id="Page_1037">[Vol II Pg 37]</a></span>
entire, with only partial dilapidation of the ornamental parts.
It is on the whole very similar to the appearance exhibited
by the remains of the <em>chándi</em> at <em>Anjóg</em>, and to the others constructed
of bricks in the eastern districts above mentioned.
Near this is a smaller <em>chándi</em>, of the same construction, in
ruins, with various other remains of antiquity.</p>

<p>The environs of the capital of <em>Kediri</em> abound with antiquities
of every kind; but it is evident that here, more than at
other places, great expense and labour has been bestowed to
demolish the buildings and to mutilate the images. In all
parts of the site of the present capital I noticed fragments
covered with sculpture in relief, broken <em>réchas</em>, and regularly
chiselled oblong stones, of that kind which was employed in
the construction of the <em>chándis</em>, besides very extensive foundations,
in brick, of walls, buildings, &amp;c. I am further led to
suppose, from the regularity and elegance of the materials employed,
that a Mahomedan temple and grave have been constructed
almost entirely from an ancient building demolished
for the purpose, at the period of the introduction of the Mahomedan
religion. This temple is called <em>Astána Gedóng</em>, but
none of the present inhabitants can give any information as
to the period of its construction. As it is of Mahomedan
origin I took only a very slight view of it, to avoid the disagreeable
gesticulations which the natives always exhibited
on the approach of one of their sanctuaries; and it is a very
comfortable circumstance that a traveller is freely permitted
to examine undisturbed, all those antiquities which are unequivocally
derived from a period preceding the introduction
of Mahomedanism, or from what the natives call "<em>wong kúna</em>,
<em>kapir</em>, or <em>buda</em>."</p>

<p>I shall shortly enumerate the principal antiquities of <em>Kedíri</em>
which I visited, and only mention the names of those villages
where the greatest number of <em>réchas</em> are dispersed. These
are <em>Pápar</em>, <em>Kebo-gádung</em>, <em>Gadúngan</em> and <em>Págot</em>.</p>

<p>The cave of <em>Séla-mángleng</em> is situated about two miles in
a western direction from the capital, at the foot of the hill
<em>Klótok</em>, an appendage to the large mountain of <em>Wílis</em>: it consists
of four small apartments cut into the solid rock composing
the hill, on a very gentle eminence. The apartments are
adjoining to each other, forming a regular series, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1038" id="Page_1038">[Vol II Pg 38]</a></span>
stretches from north to south. The two middle apartments,
which are the largest, have each an entrance from without,
while those at the extremity communicate by an interior door,
each with the apartment next to it. They differ but little in
size. Their form is square or oblong; the largest is less than
twenty feet in length. The walls of the two principal apartments
are covered with sculpture, and various platforms and
projections indicate the places of devotion or penance. Several
<em>réchas</em> now arranged in the avenue leading to the cave,
as well as the sculpture covering the walls of the apartments
within, are handsomely worked; but the external sculpture
of the rock is coarse, and the steps by which one ascends,
which are cut out of the same general mass of rock, appear to
have been made intentionally rude. Several niches for <em>réchas</em>,
lamps, &amp;c. are cut in various parts of the walls; a <em>lingam</em>, several
reservoirs of water, and other figures are arranged on the
vestibule. Of an inscription on the external rock, one regular
line, stretching from the door of the outer apartments to the
northern extremity of the rock, is still discernible, but many
of the characters are probably too much effaced to afford an
explanation.</p>

<p>In an eastern direction from the capital of <em>Kedíri</em>, the antiquities
of <em>Séntul</em> and of <em>Prúdung</em> are the most remarkable.
<em>Séntul</em> is situated near the district of <em>Tiga-wángi</em>, in a forest,
the condition of which indicates an undisturbed vegetation for
many successive ages. The dimensions of the principal edifice,
now remaining nearly entire, are comparatively inconsiderable,
but the workmanship is executed in a style of elegance,
equal to that of any antiquity found on the island. By
the present inhabitants the building is denominated a <em>chúnkup</em>,
which word, in as far as it admits of a precise translation,
denotes a place of burial or a repository of the dead. It appears
to resemble, in its general scheme, several of the other
principal antiquities of Java, being a solid massy structure,
without any internal apartment or chamber, as a <em>chándi</em>, but affording,
on the summit, an extensive platform or place of devotion,
to which one of the sides is appropriated to furnish an
ascent, while the others are perpendicular. The access to the
<em>chúnkup</em> was from the west. Not only the sides of the stairs,
but the perpendicular walls of the building, are ornamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1039" id="Page_1039">[Vol II Pg 39]</a></span>
by entablatures, the internal divisions of which are covered
by elegant sculpture, while the projections are carved into a
great variety of forms, which can only be represented clearly
by a drawing. A few images, removed from their original
situation, are dispersed through different parts of the surrounding
area, displaying an exquisite workmanship. On the summit
remains an highly elegant reservoir of water of uncommon
dimensions. The plan of this building is a nearly regular
square, the sides of which are about thirty-six feet in length.</p>

<p>It contains in its foundation a subterraneous cell, to which
the descent is by very narrow steps, leading from the south:
this consists of three compartments, gradually decreasing in
dimensions as they extend into the body of the building. The
height of the cell does not permit a person to stand erect, and
no vestiges indicate its former appropriation, whether as a
place of devotion or penance, or for the reception of the remains
of the person to whose memory devotion was paid on
the summit.</p>

<p>Near this <em>chúnkup</em> is a smaller building of the same kind,
equally ornamented by handsome sculpture. The remaining
bases of numerous walls shew the division of the surrounding
court into many compartments, and the whole adjoining territory
was included within a wall constructed of brick, of
which I found the vestiges in various points, and numerous
separate foundations and detached fragments of chiseled stone
remain within the exterior wall in the confines of the
chúnkup.</p>

<p>In proceeding from <em>Séntul</em>, in an eastern direction, to the
extremity of the province of <em>Kedíri</em>, solitary remains of antiquity
are occasionally found; and it is probable that these
extend, without considerable interruption, towards the celebrated
antiquities of <em>Málang</em>. Among these, <em>túgus</em> or landmarks
are also observed.</p>

<p>The <em>chándi</em> of <em>Prúdung</em> is situated about eight miles south-west
of <em>Séntul</em>. Though constructed entirely of brick, this
edifice deserves particular notice. It exceeds in its dimensions
and importance all other edifices built of the same materials
that I have seen. Besides a principal apartment, the
entrance to which is from the west, it contains in the east,
the north, and the south, smaller apartments on the same floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1040" id="Page_1040">[Vol II Pg 40]</a></span>
whose entrance corresponds to the niches usually observed in
the walls. The projecting base containing the stairs has been
destroyed, and one ascends at present to view the interior of
the <em>chándi</em> by a ladder, the height of about twenty feet. The
dimensions of the ornaments and figures on the sides correspond
to the size of the building, and the sculpture is executed
in a superior style. Following a southern direction, <em>réchas</em>,
reservoirs of water, mortars, fragments of buildings and ornaments,
are found at almost every village. Near the boundary,
but within the province of <em>Sreng'át</em>, a <em>chándi</em> of brick, of the
usual size, still remains entire near the village <em>Genéngan</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>réchas</em> which have been accumulated at the capital of
<em>Sreng'át</em> from the vicinity, indicate the condition of the ancient
establishments, as the general review of the antiquities
found in this province, strongly points out that its former culture
was very different from its present rudeness. Places
which are now covered with almost impenetrable forests, like
those surrounding the <em>chúnkup</em> of <em>Séntul</em>, the first appearance
of which would indicate an undisturbed growth from the origin
of vegetation, are found to conceal the most stupendous monuments
of human art and labour. During various botanical
excursions which I made through this province, I discovered
(or rather was led to them by the natives) the <em>chándi</em> of <em>Gedóg</em>,
the antiquities at <em>Penatáran</em>, and various monuments covered
with inscriptions, which I shall separately enumerate below.</p>

<p>The <em>chándi</em> of <em>Gedóg</em> is a structure in the usual style of
brick, but executed with superior excellence, while much of
the ornamental work is supplied of stone. Several of the sides
are still entire, but the base of the entrance or steps has
gradually separated. <em>Gedóg</em> is situated near <em>Blitar</em>, formerly
a capital, but now reduced to a simple village. Here, also,
interesting antiquities are found, among which the site of a
deserted capital, with its walls and many stone pedestals, attract
the notice of the traveller.</p>

<p>Proceeding in a nearly north-east direction, I visited the
antiquities at <em>Penatáran</em>. These, if not of the first rank, must
doubtless be considered as belonging to those of second importance
and interest, both on account of extent and execution;
but a complete and accurate description would require
a detail too extensive for my present purpose. The greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1041" id="Page_1041">[Vol II Pg 41]</a></span>
part of these antiquities is now in ruins. Their general plan
indicates an appropriation both to purposes of devotion and
habitation. They comprize an extensive area of an oblong
form, which was surrounded by an external wall of which the
foundations can be traced throughout, and the whole was
divided into three compartments. The principal edifice is
situated in the eastern compartment, and was only accessible
after passing three separate gates, which are all discernible,
although much decayed. They are individually guarded as at
<em>Chándi séwu</em> and <em>Sínga-sári</em>, by porters resting on their hams,
while a knee is drawn up to support the hand clasping a club
of proportionate size. The principal gate, in ancient times
probably the only entrance, is of huge dimensions, and guarded
by porters of gigantic size. This led to the first subdivision
of the whole area, in which two elevated plains, of an oblong
form, confined by walls rising above the surrounding territory,
and in all probability the floors of former places of dwelling,
are the most interesting objects that now remain.</p>

<p>One of these plains extends to the north-east extremity,
having been in contact with the external wall, as appears from
its relative situation to the gate, and to the foundations that
still exist; this is of great dimensions: the other inclines
more to the middle of this compartment, and is somewhat less
in extent. Both exhibit the appearance of having supported
a building, and are elevated at present about three feet above
the level of the surrounding forest, while the same depth is
concealed by a layer of vegetable mould, accumulated during
many successive ages. The sides of the smaller plain are
covered with elegant sculpture in relief, the detail of the design
of which would alone require a considerable time. Four
entrances are indicated by as many flights of steps, the sides of
which are elegantly decorated, and the pedestals still remaining
at regular intervals along the confines, having the form of
truncated pyramids, appear to shew that it was covered by a
roof supported by wooden pillars, somewhat in the style of
the <em>pasébans</em> of the present Javans. Similar pedestals are
likewise placed in regular order along the sides of the large
plain, which has the same number of entrances as the smaller,
of which those in the north and south are guarded by porters
of comparatively small stature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1042" id="Page_1042">[Vol II Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The second compartment is less extensive than the western:
a small <em>chúndi</em> of excellent workmanship, built of stone, here
attracts particular notice. The remains of various buildings,
pedestals, and broken ornaments, are also observed, and it is
probable that others are concealed by the forest and mould
which covers this compartment, which must be considered as
the vestibule to the third or eastern division, containing the
principal edifice: this of the various remains of the whole
area deserves the most attention. It is indeed a surprising
and a wonderful work: both the labour required in the construction,
and the art displayed in the decoration are incalculable.
The general base is a large square, but each of the
sides has a particular projection in the middle, the largest
being in the west, where the ascents are placed, by which the
outline exhibits twelve angles. It belongs to the same class
of buildings as that at <em>Séntul</em>, containing no chamber or
vacancy within, but exhibiting a solid mass, highly decorated
at the sides, and affording externally places of devotion. It
consists of three different compartments, successively of
smaller dimensions. Two pair of steps, one to the north, the
other to the south of the most projecting part of the western
side, lead to the area furnished by the lower compartment,
the form of which agrees with the general base. From the
middle of the most projecting part of the western side of this
area, a single flight of steps conducts to the second, and is
immediately continued to the third area on the summit of the
whole building. The second compartment does not agree in
form with the general base, but by means of the diverging of
the sides in a direction opposite to the most projecting parts
of the lower area, it furnishes in the west a plain before the
steps, and in the north, the south, and the east, extensive
areas or squares, which were probably destined for particular
worship. By the form of the second compartment the second
area is likewise modified; but to demonstrate this a plan
would be required; and I shall only add, that the upper area
was a regular square, but as appears from the remains of
various foundations, subdivided into partitions.</p>

<p>Here the figure of <em>Bráma</em> (the <em>récha</em> with four faces) is
placed alone, of a workmanship and finish superlatively excellent.
It is to be remarked in this place, that besides this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1043" id="Page_1043">[Vol II Pg 43]</a></span>
only one image is found on this structure, attached to the
walls of the second compartment, facing the smaller area on
the base, from which it appears to have been worshipped. I
shall not enter into a detail of the sculpture which covers all
the sides of the three compartments: its diversity far exceeds
the bounds of my examination or description. In the intelligent
visitor it excites astonishment, and displays a degree of
art and of taste, equal, as far as my opportunities for observation
have extended, to that of any of the other remains of
antiquity found on Java.</p>

<p>In clearing up part of the rubbish that surrounded the
southern sides of this edifice, I was fortunate enough to discover
a monument covered with an inscription of the usual
size and form; but the characters have suffered much from
time.</p>

<p>Of other antiquities which fell under my observation in the
province of <em>Sreng'át</em>, I shall only mention those at <em>Semánding</em>
and <em>Sangráhan</em>. These, from their semblance to the
edifice at <em>Séntul</em>, appear to have contained the remains of the
dead, and to have been employed to celebrate their memory.
They are considered as <em>chúnkups</em> by the natives. Each has
something particular in its structure and appropriation; but
I shall not extend these details. Various spots were mentioned
by the inhabitants, which are now covered with a close
forest, in which less considerable remains, <em>réchas</em>, &amp;c. are
found, and others are probably concealed or unknown. They
existed also on the south side of the large river flowing from
the east, a branch of the river of <em>Kedíri</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>, in
the tract of <em>Ludáya</em>, celebrated at present only on account of
the wildness of the territory. Among these I visited a
monument covered with inscriptions in a highly preserved
condition. In my botanical excursions through this and the
neighbouring districts, I also met with various caverns and
other remains, the retreat of <em>fakirs</em>, hermits, &amp;c. to which the
approach is difficult or painful: they are distinguished by the
denomination of <em>Ber-tápa</em>.</p>

<p>Proceeding further east, the ruins in the district of <em>Málang</em>
next attract our attention. These I visited in 1815.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1044" id="Page_1044">[Vol II Pg 44]</a></span></p>


<h3>RUINS AT SINGA SARI, &amp;c. IN THE DISTRICT OF
MALANG.</h3>

<p>We first proceeded from <em>Pasúruan</em> to <em>Láwang</em>, mounting
our horses at the ruins of a fort, which for some time withstood
the Dutch arms on their first taking possession of these
districts. Further on, between <em>Láwang</em> and <em>Málang</em>, the
scene of a famous battle fought at that time was pointed out
to us. The family of the present Regent were first appointed
to the office for services rendered on that occasion. The
road from <em>Pasúruan</em> to <em>Láwang</em> lay principally through
forests, in which we observed the <em>waríngen</em> to predominate.</p>

<p>On the next morning we visited the ruins of <em>Singa Sári</em>,
which are situated a few paces within the entrance of a teak
forest, about four miles from <em>Láwang</em>, and on the right of the
high-road leading to <em>Málang</em>.</p>

<p>The first object which attracted our attention was the
ruins of a <em>chándi</em> or temple. It is a square building, having
the entrance on the western side: its present height may be
about thirty feet. Over the entrance is an enormous gorgon
head, and a similar ornament appears originally to have been
placed on each of the other sides of the building, over the
niches, which correspond with the entrance on the western
side. In one of these niches we observed an image lying flat
on the ground, with its head off: in another, the pedestal of
an image, which we were informed had been taken away by
Mr. Engelhard; and where the traces of a third niche
appeared, the stones had been removed, and a deep hole dug,
so as to disfigure, and in a great measure demolish, this part
of the building. This was also attributed to Mr. Engelhard's
agents.</p>

<p>On entering the <em>chándi</em>, to which we ascended by stones
which had evidently been once placed as steps, we observed
a very deep excavation, and a large square stone upset and
thrown on one side. We ordered it to be filled up and the
large stone replaced. There was a round hole passing completely
through the centre of this stone, which, whether it had
been an altar, the pedestal to some image, or a <em>yóní</em>, we could
not ascertain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1045" id="Page_1045">[Vol II Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Without the building, on part of the ruins which appeared
to have been the lower terrace, we noticed two porters, with
clubs in their hands, resting on the shoulder. The features
were entirely defaced, and the images rude; but we easily
recognized their similarity to the porters at <em>Brambánan</em>.
They were, however, not above three feet high.</p>

<p>The devices, ornaments, and general style of this temple
are not very different from those of the great temple at
<em>Brambánan</em>: the cornices and mouldings are no less rich and
well executed. The external form of the building may differ,
but the recess, or chamber within, seems on the same principle.
There is no inlet for the light from above.</p>

<p>Proceeding a short distance further into the forest, we
found several images of the Hindu mythology, in excellent
preservation, and more highly executed than any we had
previously seen in the island. In the centre, without protection
from the weather, was the bull <em>Nándi</em>, quite perfect,
with the exception of the horns, one of which was lying by
the side of it. This image is above five feet and a half long,
in high preservation, and of excellent proportion and workmanship.</p>

<p>Near the bull, and placed against a tree, is a magnificent
<em>Brahma</em>. The four heads are perfect, except that there is a
mutilation about the nose. The figure is highly ornamented,
and more richly dressed than is usual.</p>

<p>Not far off we noticed <em>Mahadéwa</em>, known by his trident.
On the stone from which this is cut in relief are several
<em>Devanágari</em> characters.</p>

<p>Another stone, with a figure nearly similar, stood by it. A
Hindu Sepoy, who accompanied us, asserted that it represented
a Bramin, but it was too mutilated for us to ascertain
the point.</p>

<p>A car or chariot of <em>Súria</em>, or the sun, with seven horses, of
which the heads were wanting, was the only other object of
antiquity in this groupe. The horses are at full speed, with
extended tails, and the square of the chariot seems to have
once formed the pedestal of an image.</p>

<p>At the distance of about a hundred yards from this spot,
we were conducted to a magnificent <em>Ganésa</em> of a colossal
size, most beautifully executed, and in high preservation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1046" id="Page_1046">[Vol II Pg 46]</a></span>
The pedestal is surrounded by skulls, and skulls seem used
not only as ear-rings, but as the decoration of every part to
which they can be applied. The head and trunk are very
correct imitations of nature. The figure appears to have
stood on a platform of stone; and from the number of stones
scattered, it is not improbable it may have been inclosed in a
niche or temple.</p>

<p>Still further in the wood, at a short distance, we found
another colossal statue, of the same stamp as the porters at
<em>Brambánan</em>. This statue was lying on its face at the entrance
of an elevated stone terrace: but the people having excavated
and cleared the earth around, we were enabled distinctly to
examine the face and front. It measures in length about
twelve feet, breadth between the shoulders nine feet and a
half, and at the base nine feet by five, and is cut from one
solid stone. The figure is represented as sitting on its hams,
with the hand resting on each knee, but no club, although it
is not impossible it may have been broken off. The countenance
is well expressed and the nose prominent; but this
feature, as well as the mouth and chin, have suffered injury
from partial mutilation.</p>

<p>The statue seems evidently to have fallen from the adjacent
elevated terrace, which is about eighteen feet high in its
present dilapidated state, and is built of stones, the upper
ones being immense slabs of five feet by four, and three feet
thick. A second figure of the same dimensions was afterwards
found in the vicinity; these were no doubt porters who
guarded the entrance to these temples.</p>

<p>Having visited all that could be traced in the vicinity of
<em>Singa Sári</em>, we proceeded on to <em>Málang</em>, distant thirteen
<em>palls</em> from <em>Láwang</em>, and in the evening we visited the ruins
of <em>Súpit-úrang</em>, usually called <em>Kótah Bédah</em>, or demolished,
fort, the site of the last establishment of the refugees from
<em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>The wall of this fortification is of brick, and the foundation
is traced without difficulty. We rode round it within side,
and as far as we could calculate it could not measure less
than two miles round. It is of an irregular figure, but in a
position rendered remarkably strong by two rivers, which run
their course round three-fourths of the wall, and then unite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1047" id="Page_1047">[Vol II Pg 47]</a></span>
The depth from the wall to the rivers is from fifty to a hundred
feet, and in some places still more; in many parts the
descent is nearly perpendicular. Where the rivers do not
encircle the walls, a deep moat is cut from one river to the
other, which is easily flooded by stopping the course of either
river. It is about seventy-five feet wide and not less than
fifty deep, even in its present state, filled up no doubt considerably,
and in many parts cultivated. There appear to be
several dwellings, if not villages, within the walls, and a good
deal of cultivation, principally of tobacco.</p>

<p>The next morning we proceeded to visit the ruins at <em>Kédal</em>
and <em>Jágu</em>, the former about seven miles, the latter nearly four
from <em>Málang</em>, in a south-easterly direction.</p>

<p>At <em>Kédal</em> are the remains of a very beautiful temple of stone:
its present height about thirty-five feet. The building is supported
by a lion at each of the four cornices, and one on each
side of the steps of the entrance. In the centre of each of the
lower departments, between the lions, are figures in relief
upon the wall. The mouldings and sculpture on this temple
are in the same style as those of <em>Brambánan</em> and <em>Bóro Bódo</em>,
but of still greater beauty. The building is surrounded by a
square wall, and in the front is a raised terrace. The chamber
appears to be of the same form as most of the temples in Java.
Over the entrance is an immense gorgon head, and in the
chamber itself a deep hole.</p>

<p>There are no Hindu images or other traces of Hindu mythology,
except what may be afforded by the lions, and the
figures in relief above mentioned. These represent the same
principal figure, but with different attributes. On one side
three immense serpents entwine over the head, the tail of one
of them evidently held in the right hand; on another a water-pot,
with a serpent's head attached to it, is on the head of the
figure; and on the other there is a female figure with a serpent,
the female reclining over the head.</p>

<p>This temple is just within the skirts of a forest.</p>

<p>At <em>Jágu</em>, also, we found the ruins a few yards within a
forest, but these appeared to have been more extensive than
the preceding.</p>

<p>The base of the principal building is much larger than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1048" id="Page_1048">[Vol II Pg 48]</a></span>
of the temples we visited in the eastern part of the island, and
there appeared to have been originally two or three terraces
rising one above the other to the height of thirty feet. The
form of the entrance still appears, but the roof, sides, and
back part of the building, have entirely given way. Behind
the ruin, and apparently in the same spot on which it originally
fell, lies a dilapidated image of a Hindu deity. The
pedestal of this image is perfect, and lies near it. The head
had been carried to <em>Mélang</em> some years ago by a Dutchman.
On the back stone we observed an inscription, evidently in the
<em>Devanágari</em> character, and which the Sepoy who accompanied
us declared to be Sanscrit. The characters on each side were
extremely distinct, but those at the back of the head of the
figure were defaced.</p>

<p>This building is most richly ornamented with carved work,
and various devices in relief are cut in the first, second, and
third stories. One of these relievos represents a battle between
an army of apparently polished people and an army of
<em>Rasáksa</em>. The figures are very rudely carved and disproportioned,
but in general richness of effect may be compared to
the style of the ornaments at <em>Bóro Bódo</em>. There are a variety of
processions and achievements represented in different parts,
but no where could we observe any image or particular object
of devotion. Along the cornices, which are most splendidly
rich, we noticed birds and beasts of various descriptions interwoven.
In one part a palm tree between two lambs approaching
each other, in another a perfect boar, apparently led to
the sacrifice.</p>

<p>At a short distance from this principal building, say fifty
yards, stands the remains of what would appear to have been
an elevated terrace of about twelve feet high. The ascent is
on one side, by regular stone steps, still perfect.</p>

<p>Previously to leaving <em>Málang</em> we took sketches of two
images brought in from the fort, and also of the image of a
man, peculiar from the manner in which the hair was tied.
At <em>Málang</em>, also, I received from the <em>Tumúng'gung</em> a small
square stone-box, containing a golden <em>lingam</em>; this had been
discovered three months before, about a cubit under ground,
by a peasant, while digging for stones to build his cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1049" id="Page_1049">[Vol II Pg 49]</a></span>
place. The <em>lingam</em> had originally two very small red stones
within it, something like rubies; one of them was lost before
it was delivered to me, the other by the party examining it.</p>


<h3>TEMPLES AT SÚKU.</h3>

<p>The remains of antiquity still existing at <em>Súku</em>, though not to
be compared with those at <em>Brambánan</em> and <em>Bóro Bódo</em> in extent
and magnificence, seem to claim a peculiar interest, on account
of the indication they afford of a different form of worship.
These ruins were not known to Europeans until a short time
previous to my visit to the central districts, in May 1815. When
I visited them, the native inhabitants of <em>Súra-kérta</em> were also
ignorant of their existence, and we are indebted for the discovery
to the British Resident at that court, Major Martin Johnson.</p>

<p>They lie in an eastern direction from <em>Séra-kerta</em>, and are
distant from that capital about twenty-six English miles, being
situated on the summit of one of the smaller hills to be found
on the base of the mountain <em>Láwu</em>. From <em>Súra-kérta</em> our road
was a continued ascent, which increased as we approached
the hills: the country most highly cultivated, and in the immediate
vicinity of the hills, where the dry cultivation predominated,
beautiful beyond description.</p>

<p><em>Súku</em> is the name of the village to which the lands in the
neighbourhood of these ruins are annexed; and we were not
able to ascertain that they were designated by any other name,
or that the term <em>Súku</em> had any immediate reference or application
to the buildings.</p>

<p>The principal structure is a truncated pyramid, situated on
the most elevated of three successive terraces. The ruins of
two obelisks, having the form of the section of a pyramid, are
also observable in the vicinity of the principal building, and
on each side of the western front appear several piles of
ruinous buildings and sculpture. The length of the terraces
is about one hundred and fifty-seven feet; the depth of the
first, eighty feet; of the second, thirty; and of the highest,
one hundred and thirty feet.</p>

<p>The approach is from the west, through three porches or
gateways, of which the outermost alone is now standing; but
enough remains of the second and third to indicate a similarity
of construction. This porch is a building of about six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1050" id="Page_1050">[Vol II Pg 50]</a></span>teen
feet high, in tolerable preservation, of a pyramidal form.
The entrance is seven feet and a half high, and about three
feet wide; a gorgon head forms the key-stone of the arch.
The ascent is first by seven, and shortly after by three steps;
and in relief, on the centre of the flooring under the porch, is a
representation of the male and female pudenda.</p>

<p>On the outer face of the porch several figures are sculptured
in relief. On the right side, the principal figure is that of a
man of monstrous appearance devouring a child: to his right
a dog sitting, the head wanting, and a bird of the stork kind
near the root of a tree, on one of the branches of which a
bird not unlike a dove or pigeon is perched; over the figure
is a bird on the wing, either the hawk or eagle. Above the
figure of a man with the tail of a writhing snake in his mouth,
is another which appeared to us to be that of a sphynx; it is
however represented as floating in the air, with the legs, arms,
and tail extended. The tail is similar to that of the lizard
species, and the hands appear to be webbed claws, but the
body, limbs, and face, are human: the breasts distinguish it
as female. Over this again is a small curling reptile, like a
worm or small snake, reminding us of the asp.</p>

<p>On the north and on the south face of the gateway there is
a colossal eagle with extended wings, holding in its talons
an immense serpent, plaited in three folds, its head turned towards
the eagle and ornamented with a coronet.</p>

<p>It was impossible to reflect on the design of these sculptures,
without being forcibly struck with their reference to
the ancient worship of Egypt. The form of the gateway
itself, and of all the ruins within our view, was pyramidal.
In the monster devouring the child we were reminded of <em>Typhon</em>;
in the dog, of <em>Anoubis</em>; in the stork, of the <em>Ibis</em>: the
tree, too, seemed to be the palm, by which the Egyptians designated
the year; the pigeon, the hawk, the immense serpents,
were all symbols of Egyptian worship.</p>

<p>Lying on the first terrace we observed several scattered
stones, having various devices sculptured on them, some of
human figures, one of a tiger wanting the head, which had
been broken off, and several of elephants and oxen. On one
we noticed the representation of a man on horseback, followed
by five spearmen and a <em>páyong</em> bearer. We then ascended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1051" id="Page_1051">[Vol II Pg 51]</a></span>
by five steps to the second terrace, on which were also some
scattered ruins of buildings and sculpture. Ascending again
three steps we came to the third terrace, when the principal
building appeared in front, at the distance of about ninety
feet. The ruins of several other temples and buildings also
appeared in irregular heaps on each side of its front.</p>

<p>This building is on the centre of the terrace. Its base is a
perfect square, of forty-three feet and a half to the side, decreasing
in size at each successive layer of stones, so as to
form steps to the height of nineteen feet; above this is a sort
of cornice, four feet nine inches high. The roof is twenty-one
feet two inches from north to south, and nineteen feet nine
inches from east to west. In the centre of it we observed a
part raised, of about a foot square, pierced by a small round
hole. It had the appearance of being intended as a pedestal,
or step, to some object which had been removed.</p>

<p>The sides of the pyramid face the cardinal points. The
western side contains a flight of narrow steps. At the top, in
the front of the building, we noticed two serpents, which appear
to have been used for water-pipes; with this exception,
the whole building was plain and unornamented by sacred
emblems. The sides of the staircase are faced with flat stones.
The upper story or cornice is constructed with greater delicacy
than the building generally. We were not able to ascertain
whether there was any chamber within, and the point cannot
be decided without material injury to the edifice. The eastern
side seems to have suffered most from the effects of time.</p>

<p>Upon the ground on each side of the ascent is a large stone,
in the shape of a tortoise, measuring not less than eight feet
in length; the back flat, but the head well executed. A little
advanced in front there is a third of the same description.</p>

<p>Near these, on the south side of the entrance, stand the remains
of two temples, in one of which we discovered the
ashes of fire recently kindled. The natives who attended informed
us that the peasantry of the neighbouring villages
were still in the habit of burning incense and kindling fire in
this temple, and that when they suffered under or dreaded any
misfortune, they made an offering of this nature in the hope
of averting it. The building is about seven feet square, and
on all sides various images are sculptured on it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1052" id="Page_1052">[Vol II Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The other building, which is still further south, has a terrace
in the centre, the steps ascending to which are still perfect.
The building appears to retain nothing of its original
pyramidal form, except at the south-east corner.</p>

<p>On different sides of this pile of building we noticed two inscriptions,
each consisting of four characters. As they both
agreed with various other inscriptions in this neighbourhood,
except in the last character, which was different in all, we
concluded that they were dates. To the north of the principal
building, and almost contiguous to it, is an oblong structure,
running east and west. On this there has evidently been a
low terrace with a raised wall at the back. On the upper part
of this terrace, and near the principal building, is a raised
platform, from which rises an obelisk, somewhat similar to that
noticed in the south, but of a much larger base, and ornamented
with various devices on all sides. The spiral top is
incomplete. Resting inclined upon the west front of the
obelisk, is a statue, about four feet high and three feet broad<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>On each side of the terrace, which is narrow and long, we
observed, both above and below, various devices cut in relief;
also a stone vase for containing water, respecting which a tradition
runs, that it could never be empty. We also raised
from the ground and took sketches of several slabs and stones
in the vicinity, which had been thrown down on their faces.
Of these, one represents a horned boar<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. On another is an
elephant, tolerably well executed. In another the chief figure
is represented striking off human heads<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>. On another there is
a dog standing erect, and dressed like a man, with some buildings
remarkable for the correctness of the perspective. On
another is a representation of the monkey flag<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>, the standard
of <em>Arjúna</em>, and even used at the present day by the <em>Gládak</em><a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
established at <em>Súra-kérta</em>.</p>

<p>We discovered, nearly buried in the ground, two gigantic
statues with human bodies and limbs, but winged from the
arms like bats, and with spurs above the heel like those of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1053" id="Page_1053">[Vol II Pg 53]</a></span>cock. This figure occurs frequently in relief with some variation:
sometimes with a fan-tail, and its wings extended, so as
almost to form a circle<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>; in another the face appears devoid
of flesh, and the figure is standing with one foot on an elephant
and the other on a tortoise<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.</p>

<p>On the lappet of the waistband of one of these colossal
statues we noticed an inscription of several lines; but the most
interesting and perfect was discovered on the back of the
other, after we had with much difficulty raised it to an erect
posture. This last inscription is in excellent preservation,
and consists of lines, in each of which there are characters.
The perfect state of this part of the stone must be attributed
to its having been protected from the weather by its position
along the ground. This inscription, as well as all the others
which we discovered, are raised from the stone in relief, in the
same character as that first noticed, which differs from most
which had previously been discovered on the island<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.</p>

<p>We noticed particularly, as forming an exception to the
sculptures in general, another figure with four hands. It has
a coronet on the head, and ear-rings, and from the back of the
ear on each side appear to spring wings, which are half expanded
over the back of each shoulder. The arms and hands
were too mutilated to enable us to distinguish the attributes.</p>

<p>A little nearer to the north of the tortoises, in front of the
principal building, stands a large erect statue<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>, apparently in
its original position; at the back of which, on a scroll hanging
from the waistband, is an inscription of several lines; a figure
holding a double-headed trident in each hand and having
three spikes on each elbow, rudely executed, and elsewhere a
<em>phallus</em>, upwards of six feet long and not less than five in circumference.
It had been broken in halves, but the two parts
were easily brought together: round the upper part are four
large balls of equal dimensions: along the urethra is an inscription
in two lines, the letters being one above the other,
and on the upper part of one of these lines is the representation
of a <em>kris</em> blade, and two squares crossing each other just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1054" id="Page_1054">[Vol II Pg 54]</a></span>above the point, with a circle and other ornaments in the
centre, so as to represent the sun; to the right of this is a representation
of the moon in the first quarter; and further
again to the right a small circle, representing a star: the whole
in relief, very correctly executed, and in good preservation.</p>

<p>On one of the temples adjacent there are representations of
a similar symbol cut in relief.</p>

<p>We observed several monstrous figures with clubs of different
sizes. One in particular fronting the principal building,
grinning most horribly, and two near the steps leading to the
upper terrace from the south.</p>

<p>Below the upper terrace, on the south side, we noticed the
foundation of a building of an oblong shape, with three large
slabs, on which were sculptured several objects which appeared
much to interest the Javans. On one we observed a
manufacturer of <em>kris</em> blades in the act of striking the steel.
Above him are placed, as in his workshop, among several
blades of different forms, a trident, a water-pot, a pair of
shares, and something not very unlike Mercury's wand. On
another stone is seen a man with the proboscis of an elephant,
and in his hand a dog; on the third is a man blowing a
Javan bellows.</p>

<p>The natives informed us, that the country people were in
the habit of making offerings to these sculptures, which they
highly esteemed, from a tradition that they represented the
original Javan <em>túkang bési</em>, or workman in iron and steel.</p>

<p>The workmanship is ruder than that in the temples at
<em>Brambánan</em>, <em>Bóro Bódo</em>, or <em>Málang</em>, and the worship must
have been different.</p>

<p>Most of the images which are not in relief have been
decapitated, and the heads are not to be found; but there
still remains enough to enable a person well acquainted with
heathen mythology, to decide on the classes to which they
may generally be referred.</p>

<p>I could find no traditions regarding these temples; but
subsequent examination has enabled us to decide that the
character found in the inscriptions is an ancient form of the
Javan, and that the dates are, on one of the stones, 1361, and
on the larger phallus, 1362.</p>

<p>Besides the ruins of temples in brick noticed by Dr. Hors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1055" id="Page_1055">[Vol II Pg 55]</a></span>field
in the eastern provinces of the native princes, numerous
buildings constructed of similar materials, are found extending
from the site of <em>Majapáhit</em> eastward as far as <em>Probolíngo</em>,
near which, a few yards off the high road, are situated two
temples in brick. The larger temple may be about sixty
feet high.</p>

<p>All the temples of this class (that is to say, constructed in
brick, for they all vary in their style) were probably built
during the latter years of the Hindu religion. Those constructed
of stone must be referred to a much earlier period.</p>

<p>Near Buitenzorg, and also at <em>Récha Dómas</em>, a few miles
further inland, both places adjacent to the site of the ancient
capital of <em>Pajajáran</em>, are found several rude images in stone,
and among them a figure with three faces (<em>trimúrti</em>). Images
of the same kind, as well as casts in metal, are also found in
<em>Chéribon</em>. The latter are particularly prized by the chiefs of
<em>Telága</em>, who are descended from the princes of <em>Pajajáran</em>,
and consider these relics as representations of their forefathers.
In the possession of the present <em>Tumúng'gung</em> of
<em>Telága</em> is an ancient manuscript written on Javan paper, and
folded up in the manner of the manuscripts of Ava. The
characters appear to be ancient Javan or <em>Káwi</em>, but ill written.
This manuscript contains drawings of deities, of the signs of
the Zodiac, and numerous other astronomical, or perhaps
rather astrological devices<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>. Of the history of the manuscript
nothing is known, further than that the <em>Tumúng'gung</em> and
his family believe it to have come with the relics before-mentioned
from <em>Pajajáran</em>. A copy of it has been brought
to England.</p>

<p>Besides the extensive remains of temples and other edifices
already mentioned in the districts east of <em>Chéribon</em>, where alone
the antiquities deserve attention as works of art, there are to be
found on the mountains of <em>Ung'árang</em> the ruins of several very
beautifully executed temples in stone, with numerous dilapidated
figures, and among them several chariots of <em>Súría</em>, or
the sun. Most of them are sadly mutilated, but enough was
left to authorize a sketch of their original design<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Chándi Banyukúning</em> (yellow water), which are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1056" id="Page_1056">[Vol II Pg 56]</a></span>called from their vicinity to the village of that name, are
situated within a few yards of a small volcanic crater, which
at the time I visited them was in many parts too hot to be
trodden with safety. They appear to have been built on
extensive terraces cut out of the mountain, and rising one
above another at intervals of some hundred yards. The
natives assert, that the temples were formerly far more extensive,
and that near the summit of several of the adjoining
peaks other temples are to be found. But here, as in most
parts of Java, the mountains for a considerable way below
the summit have been covered for ages, with an almost impenetrable
forest: and where this is not the case, the mountains
have either been rent near their summit, or are covered
with lava or ashes from volcanic eruptions, so that whatever
may have formerly been the extent and grandeur of the
edifices which once crowned these towering heights, they are
at present either concealed or more frequently destroyed.
Notwithstanding the diligent search made by the British
during the short period of their stay on Java, there are doubtless
many very interesting discoveries to be made.</p>

<p>In <em>Banyuwángi</em>, the most eastern province of the island,
besides figures of Hindu deities, several others are to be
found of extraordinary and grotesque appearance, which
appear to represent the local deities of the island, and corresponding
with those which are still worshipped on <em>Báli</em>.
But whether they are to be considered as the deities of the
Javans or Bálians is doubtful, as the Bálians long had possession
of this province; and it is remarkable, that no such
figures are to be found in the provinces further westward.</p>

<p>The traditions of the country concerning the former seats
of government, enable us to trace at this day the site of
<em>Médang Kamûlan</em>, <em>Jang'gála</em>, <em>Gegélang</em> or <em>Sínga Sári</em>, <em>Dahá</em>
or <em>Kedíri</em>, <em>Pajajâran</em>, and <em>Majapáhit</em>, existing in remains of
immense tanks, heaps of building materials, and other unequivocal
vestiges of former cities.</p>

<p><em>Médang Kamúlan</em><a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> was situated in the district of <em>Wirasába</em>,
where in the centre of an extensive forest is pointed
out the site of the <em>Setíngel</em>, distinguished by heaps of stones
and bricks; and at no great distance from it are the walls
and excavations of an extensive tank, several hundred feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1057" id="Page_1057">[Vol II Pg 57]</a></span>in length and breadth. These ruins, of which little more can
be said than that they are clearly discernible, are situated
between <em>Penwadádos</em> and the most eastern of the volcanic
wells alluded to in a former part of this work. The natives
have a superstition, that the site of this ancient capital cannot
be visited without some misfortune attaching to the party
who undertake the visit. Those whom I had, with some
difficulty, induced to accompany me to the spot, did not fail
to assure me that I should lose my government within the
year. As the event justified the prediction, it is probable that
the superstition has rather gained ground than otherwise.
Many Javans maintain, that <em>Brambánan</em> was the original of
<em>Médang Kamúlan</em>; it is at least highly probable that it was
once the seat of empire.</p>

<p>The site of <em>Jang'gála</em> is still pointed out in the district of
that name in the division of <em>Surabáya</em>, and the country
around is strewed with antiquities. The same may be said
of <em>Síng'a Sári</em> and <em>Kedíri</em>. At <em>Pajajáran</em>, a heap of stones
is pointed out as the ruin of the <em>Setíngel</em>, and numerous lines
crossing the country between rivers, attest the care with
which this position was entrenched. They may be seen close
by the road side, at a few hundred yards from the governor-general's
country residence, and in many places they have
been cut through to make a passage for the high road.</p>

<p>At <em>Majapáhit</em>, in the district of <em>Wirasába</em>, the marks of
former grandeur are more manifest. Here the walls of the
tank, upwards of a thousand feet in length, and not less than
six hundred in breadth, are quite perfect. They are of burnt
brick, and about twelve feet high. The whole area of the
tank, when I visited it, was one sheet of beautiful rice cultivation,
and almost surrounded by a noble forest of teak.</p>

<p>A village adjacent is called <em>Tra Wúlan</em>, or <em>Tráng Wúlan</em>
(the light of the moon): here we found the tomb of <em>Pútri
Chámpa</em>. Proceeding through three regular squares, each
enclosed with a wall, and in each of which were erected
several <em>pendápas</em> or sheds, we came to the interior on ascending
a few steps. On the right side of this enclosure, and
elevated a few feet, was the tomb of the princess and her
nurse; the tomb being in the Mahomedan style, and having
upon it, in ancient Javan characters, the date 1320, perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1058" id="Page_1058">[Vol II Pg 58]</a></span>
distinct and in relief. On the other side are the tombs of
<em>Kiái Tumúng'gung Jáya Báya</em>, <em>Den Mas</em>, and nine other
chiefs whose names are mentioned. The tomb is religiously
guarded by several priests.</p>

<p>The ruins of the palace and several gateways of burnt
brick are to be seen; but the whole country, for many miles,
is thickly covered with a stately teak forest, which appears
to have been the growth of ages, so that it is difficult to trace
the outline of this former capital. Ruins of temples, mostly
executed in brick, are scattered about the country for many
miles, and attest the extent and grandeur of this "pride of Java."</p>

<p>I observed near the former site of <em>Majapáhit</em> two images
of <em>Ganésa</em>, and some other mutilated deities of the Hindu
mythology. Near the tank was the figure represented in one
of the plates<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>, partly human and partly of the form of a bird,
and a distorted figure, which the Javans called <em>Ménak Jing'ga</em>;
but in general the vicinity of <em>Majapáhit</em> is remarkable for
the absence of any representations of the Hindu deities. The
temples are beautifully decorated with representations of
flowers, and other peculiar ornaments, which it would be
difficult to describe.</p>

<p>The only collection which appears to have been made by
Europeans of these interesting remains of antiquity, previously
to the establishment of the British government in 1811, was
by Mr. Engelhard, formerly governor of <em>Semárang</em>. In the
garden of the residency of that station, several very beautiful
subjects in stone were arranged, brought in from different
parts of the country. Of them, and of several others, which
appear to have been brought into some of the native villages
from the vicinity of the different temples, drawings have
been taken, and the representations of <em>Ganésa</em><a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> and <em>Dúrga</em>
(called <em>Lora Jóngran</em>), both from subjects as large as life,
wrought in close-grained stone, will serve to convey some notion
of the beauty and delicacy with which they are executed.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this very general and imperfect account
of sculpture on Java, by referring the reader to the plate,
containing representations of several subjects in stone<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>, collected
and arranged in the Chinese temple of worship in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1059" id="Page_1059">[Vol II Pg 59]</a></span>neighbourhood of Batavia. The period at which they were
collected is not known, and the subjects in general are not so
well executed as those found in the eastern parts of the island;
but it is remarkable, that the Chinese, whose form of worship
is at present so different from that of the Hindus (however
similar it may have been formerly) should in a foreign land
thus prize and appreciate the idols of the people whom they
affect to hold in contempt<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<p>Another plate exhibits several subjects in stone, collected
from the vicinity of <em>Bóro Bódo</em> in <em>Kedú</em>. The originals are
as large as life, and the sculpture and ornaments are executed
with great skill. No. 2 is an image with three heads (or <em>trimúrti</em>,)
similar to one on <em>Gúnung Dieng</em>. No. 3 is a mutilated
image of <em>Bráhma</em>, having four faces; this was found in a field
within a few hundred yards of the great temple of <em>Bóro Bódo</em>.
The image No. 4 also occurs on <em>Gúnung Práhu</em>.</p>

<p>The casts in metal which have been discovered in the
central districts of Java are numerous. The subjects represented
in the plates annexed were selected from a collection
of about a hundred brought by me to this country. They
had most of them been found at different times near the ruins
of the temples, and preserved in the families of the petty
chiefs. I am indebted to Mr. Lawrence, the Resident of <em>Kédú</em>,
for many of them, which were brought in to him by the natives,
on its being generally known that subjects of the kind
were interesting to the British authorities.</p>

<p>These casts are generally of copper, sometimes of brass, and
rarely of silver. The majority and best executed were found
in the vicinity of <em>Gúnung Dieng</em>; and it is asserted that formerly
many gold casts of a similar description were discovered,
which have been melted down. The village of <em>Káli
Béber</em>, situated at the foot of the mountain, is said from time
immemorial to have paid its annual rent, amounting to upwards
of a thousand dollars, in gold, procured by melting
down the relics of antiquity discovered in the vicinity; but
for some years past, no more golden images being found, the
rents are paid in the coin of the country.</p>

<p>Among the casts which are now exhibited will be observed
two images of <em>Bráhma</em>; one with eight arms, standing upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1060" id="Page_1060">[Vol II Pg 60]</a></span>
a male and female figure; the other with four, on a pedestal
surmounted by the lotus, having a fragment of the goose in
front. The former, in particular, is most beautifully executed.</p>

<p>The casts vary from three to six inches in height, and
abound in a variety of delicate ornaments, which it has not
been attempted to represent in the plates.</p>

<p>Several copper cups, varying from three to five inches in
diameter, and having the signs of the zodiac and other designs
represented upon them in relief, have likewise been discovered
in different parts of the island. A fac simile (reduced) of them
is given in the annexed plate.</p>

<p>As the Javans of the present day attach no particular designation
to the different deities, except that of <em>Gána</em> and
other terms to <em>Ganésa</em>, and that of <em>Lóro Jóngran</em> to <em>Dúrga</em>,
I have not thought it necessary to attach to all the representations
the names which some of them may bear in the Hindu
mythology of continental India. Many of them do not occur
in Moor's Pantheon: some are decidedly Braminical, others
Budh, and some it is difficult to class under either head.</p>

<p>A variety of bells, tripods, and ornaments of various
descriptions, occur in casts of metal, and form part of the
collection brought to England. These are of a small size,
seldom exceeding a few inches in length, although bells sometimes
occur much larger; several of them are represented in
one of the plates.</p>

<p>The inscriptions engraved on stone, and in characters no
longer understood by the people of the country, are innumerable:
similar inscriptions engraved on copper have also
been found in particular districts. The whole may be classed
under the following heads:</p>

<p>1. Inscriptions in the ancient <em>Davanágari</em> character of continental
India.</p>

<p>2. Inscriptions in characters which appear to have some
connection with the modern Javan, and were probably the
characters used by the people of <em>Súnda</em>.</p>

<p>3. Inscriptions in various characters, not appearing to have
any immediate connection with either the <em>Davanágari</em> or the
Javan characters, and which it has not been practicable to
decypher.</p>

<p>4. Inscriptions in the <em>Káwi</em> or ancient Javan character.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1061" id="Page_1061">[Vol II Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these the first seem to lay claim to the highest antiquity.
The principal inscription of this kind, and indeed the
only one of any length, is that found at <em>Brambánan</em>, and
noticed by Colonel Mackenzie in his interesting account of
the ruins of <em>Brambánan</em>, as a real Hindu <em>Sassanum</em>. The
stone, which is now broken into six parts, was originally six
feet nine inches long and three feet six wide, in the shape of
a tomb-stone, and the whole of one face is covered with characters,
which appear to have been very well executed.</p>

<p>Fac-similes of this inscription having been brought to
Europe, the characters were immediately recognized by Mr.
Wilkins as an ancient form of the <em>Devanágari</em>, in use upon
the continent of India, probably about eight or nine centuries
since. It is to be regretted, that from the constant exposure
of the stone, and the fractures which it has received, the characters
are in many parts effaced, so as to render it almost
impossible to connect the sentences. No date can be discovered,
nor any name which might afford a clue to the object
or origin of the inscription. From such detached parts as
are legible, it appears to be a record of some grant of honour
or riches to the party whose praises it records. A specimen
of a sentence from this inscription, of the same size as the
original, with the corresponding characters in the modern <em>Devanágari</em><a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>,
appears in the chapter on Language and Literature.</p>

<p>Similar characters, though apparently somewhat more
modern, are found on several images at <em>Sínga Sári</em>, transcripts
of some of which will be seen in the plates to this work.</p>

<p>Of the second class are the inscriptions on the <em>Bátu túlis</em>,
or engraved stone, standing near the ruins of the ancient capital
of <em>Pajajárán</em>, and those found at <em>Kwáli</em>, in the province
of <em>Chéribon</em>, to which place it is related that some of the
princes of <em>Pajajárán</em> fled on the overthrow of that capital by
the Mahomedans. The characters on these inscriptions
appear very nearly to resemble each other. The stone at
<em>Pajajárán</em>, as far as I could decypher it, with the assistance
of the <em>Panambáhan</em> of <em>Súmenap</em>, appears to be a record in
praise of a certain <em>Maharája</em>, whose name is not mentioned.
One of these at <em>Kwáli</em>, a fac-simile of which is exhibited in
the plate, we were enabled to translate as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1062" id="Page_1062">[Vol II Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>"The <em>Pandíta</em> is able to check the evil course of men, by
washing away their evil inclinations, and he can shew them
the right way, and prevent covetousness and slander by his
good advice. 1363."</p>

<p>At <em>Kwáli</em> there are several other inscriptions in the same
character, but in common with the whole of this class very
rudely executed. Several of the characters and signs were
found, on strict examination, to be on the same principle as
the Javan.</p>

<p>Of the third class the reader will find a fac-simile on a reduced
scale<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.</p>

<p>But the inscriptions of the last of these classes are the
most numerous, the best executed, in the highest state of preservation,
and as they admit of translation, are of perhaps
higher interest than the others. Of these some have been
already noticed in Dr. Horsfield's account of the remains of
antiquity in the vicinity of <em>Kedíri</em> (formerly called <em>Dahá</em>);
many have been found in the vicinity of the supposed site of
the ancient capital of <em>Jang'gála</em>, in the division of the modern
<em>Surabáya</em>, and some at <em>Bátu</em>, near <em>Sínga Sári</em>. These are
invariably engraved on large flat stones, in the shape of tomb-stones,
resting upon a kind of throne of lotus leaves<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. Fac-similes
of the whole of these have been brought to England,
and several have been translated into English.</p>

<p>In the collection of inscriptions at <em>Surabáya</em>, the following
dates appear:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="collection of inscriptions">
  <tr>
    <td>On a stone found near <em>Jang'gála</em></td>
    <td class="tdr">863</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>On another found near the same place</td>
    <td class="tdr">845</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>On another from the <em>Kendang</em> hills</td>
    <td class="tdr">865</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>Several prior dates, as 116, 363, 647, 773, are mentioned
in the body of these inscriptions, which seem to refer to historical
events of preceding centuries; but the dates above
mentioned, with some others, appear in the usual place to
shew the actual date of the inscription itself.</p>

<p>The date of a similar inscription found in <em>Kedú</em> is 505,
and of another stone found in the central districts, 506; but
it has not yet been ascertained what particular events these
inscriptions record. The annexed translations from three of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1063" id="Page_1063">[Vol II Pg 63]</a></span>the stones collected at <em>Surabáya</em>, were made by Captain
Davey at my request, with the assistance of the <em>Panambáhan</em>
of <em>Súmenap</em><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.</p>

<p>Inscriptions in the same character have likewise been
found on copper, very beautifully executed, and in a high
state of preservation. The date on one of these has been ascertained
to be 735, and on another, 865. I found several
collected in the Museum of the Society of Arts and Sciences
at Batavia<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Panambáhan</em> of <em>Sumenap</em> was able to read the latter
without difficulty; but finding them to be filled with terms of
praise and devotion which he could not comprehend, it was
not attempted to render a literal translation. One of the
plates (No. 3), to which at my request he devoted particular
attention, contains an invocation to <em>Sang yang Bráma</em>, to
favour and prosper the country of <em>Gegélang</em> (<em>Sínga Sári</em>),
and to give assistance, by means of <em>Jáya Kátsang</em>, in repelling
all evils and attacks, so that the country may become celebrated
and flourishing.</p>

<p>The country of <em>Gegélang</em> (<em>Sínga Sári</em>) flourished in the time
of <em>Pánji</em>.</p>

<p>Another of these plates (No. 9) contains an invocation of
a similar nature, in favour of the country of <em>Dahá</em> (<em>Kediri</em>),
which flourished at the same time.</p>

<p>In some of the eastern districts of the Native Provinces
and at <em>Súku</em>, near the mountain <em>Láwu</em>, inscriptions on stone
occur in relief. Some of them occupy stones several feet
high, and are written in well executed letters, above an inch
square. The date of one of these is 1363. A fac-simile of
another of the same kind reduced, is given in the plate<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a translation of this inscription, as far as
it could be rendered into modern Javan by the <em>Panambáhan</em>
of <em>Súmenap</em>.</p>

<p>"This is an advice to mankind, whose ignorance arises out
of a covetous desire to obtain more than they possess. If
mankind were not by their disposition inclined to be covetous
of what others possess, and to scandalize each other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1064" id="Page_1064">[Vol II Pg 64]</a></span>where would be the use of advice; when they are receiving
advice, they have a confidence in doing what is right, but
afterwards they follow their natural inclinations. Therefore,
oh ye men of the city, be advised by this, not to follow
such dispositions, but to do what is required of you by the
times and the customs of the country, and be not singular."</p>

<p>In the present burial place at <em>Grésik</em> are the tombs of
several of the early Mahomedan missionaries, most of them of
stone, bearing inscriptions with dates. That of <em>Sheik Mulána
Ibrahim</em> is in marble, and in good preservation, having the
date 1334 (409 years since). Here is also the tomb of <em>Mulána
Mach'ríbi</em>, who was antecedent to <em>Ibrahim</em>. This has, however,
fallen to decay, and has no legible inscription.</p>

<p>The entrance to the cemetery is through several squares enclosed
by walls and gateways, some of them very ancient,
and in the same style of architecture as distinguishes those of
<em>Majapáhit</em>. On the side of the gateway leading to the division
in which are the most ancient tombs, is a small stone
pillar, with the date 1340 upon it in relief. Passing on to
the division in which the family of the regents is interred,
are also to be noticed many relics in stone, brought from
some of the Hindu ruins. Among these is a gigantic toad or
frog, and an oblong vessel of three feet long, having in relief
the date 1246. On the side of the tomb of the great grandfather
of the present regent, is a <em>Yóni</em>, said to have been
brought from <em>Majapáhit</em>, and in this Mahomedan sanctuary
serving as a kneeling or resting place to the tomb. Similar
relics are to be found in other burial places in the eastern part
of the island, most of the chiefs priding themselves upon
having some remnant of <em>Majapáhit</em>. At the residence of the
regent of <em>Surabáya</em> are also collected several curious remains;
and in particular a large bath, excavated from a solid stone
about six feet long.</p>

<p>In the central and eastern districts of Java, in the vicinity
of the dilapidated temples, are found numerous ancient coins
in brass and copper, exhibiting various subjects in relief, and
invariably with a hole in the middle for the convenience of
stringing them. Those which are represented in the plate<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
are taken indiscriminately from a collection of upwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1065" id="Page_1065">[Vol II Pg 65]</a></span>of a hundred brought to England, the dates annexed to each
being determined by the <em>Chándra Sangkála</em>, as explained for
each particular coin by the <em>Kiái Adipáti</em> of <em>Demák</em>. Thus
the last, which has the date 1568, is explained as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table class="tdc" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="1568">
  <tr>
    <td><em>Naga</em></td>
    <td><em>hoba</em></td>
    <td><em>wisaya</em></td>
    <td><em>jalma</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Snakes</td>
    <td>move</td>
    <td>work</td>
    <td>men</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>That is to say, "snakes are moving while men are working:"
alluding to the two snakes which appear entwining
together between and above the two men who are mastering
an animal. The coin with the date 1489, bears a Javan inscription
of <em>Pangéran Rátu</em>, the title by which a prince of
Bantam, who reigned in that year, is recognized by the
Javans.</p>

<p>The mode of determining these dates by the <em>Chándra
Sangkála</em>, appears however so uncertain and ill understood,
that perhaps but little reliance is to be placed on it. I have,
nevertheless, given them, in order to show the notion of the
Javans on the subject, and as it is not improbable they may
be found useful in illustrating the early history of the country.
Many of the coins not European or Indian, found in the Archipelago,
as well as in China and Japan, have a hole in the
centre. These coins seem to have been of home manufacture:
the execution is rude; but the figures, such as they are,
in general well defined and clearly expressed. In the vicinity
of the principal temples have been found small silver
coins, about the size of a Madras pagoda, bearing the impression
of a small cross, and of some rude and unintelligible characters.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most striking and interesting vestige of
antiquity which is to be found in the Eastern Seas, is the
actual state of society in the island of <em>Báli</em>, whither the persecuted
Hindus took refuge on the destruction of <em>Majapáhit</em>,
and where the Hindu religion is still the established worship
of the country. This interesting island has hitherto been but
little explored by Europeans, and what we know of it is only
sufficient to make us anxious to know more. I visited the
island in 1815, and such particulars concerning it as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1066" id="Page_1066">[Vol II Pg 66]</a></span>
limits of the present work admit of will be found in Appendix
K.</p>

<p>In the course of the present work it has been my object to
convey to the public, in as compressed a form as my time
permitted, and without bias from previously conceived opinions
or new theories, the information which I possessed.
The antiquities of Java, however, afford such an ample and
interesting subject for speculation, that I shall presume on
the reader's desire for some opinion concerning their origin
and purpose.</p>

<p>With respect to the remains of architectural grandeur and
sculptural beauty which have been noticed, I shall simply
observe, that it seems to be the general opinion of those most
versed in Indian antiquities, that the large temple of <em>Bóro
Bódo</em> (a corruption perhaps of the <em>Bára Búdha</em>, or the Great
Budh,) and several others, were sacred to the worship of
<em>Budh</em>. The style and ornament of this temple are found
much to resemble those of the great <em>Budh</em> temple at <em>Gai-ya</em>,
on the continent of India, and it is probable that it may have
been constructed by the same people, perhaps even by the
same artists. The <em>Devanágari</em> characters on the inscription
found at <em>Brambánan</em> are recognized by Mr. Wilkins to be
such as were in use on continental India eight or nine hundred
years ago. The date of several inscriptions in the ancient
Javan characters, found in the central part of Java, is in the
sixth century, supposed to be of the present Javan era, and the
traditions of the Javans concerning the arrival of enlightened
strangers, and an intimate connexion between Java and continental
India, for the most part refer this intercourse to the
sixth and three following centuries, that is to say, to the
period of the empires of <em>Medang Kamúlan</em> and <em>Jáng'gala</em>.</p>

<p>Mahomedanism having become the established religion in
the year 1400 (A.D. 1475,) all the great works of a Pagan
character must, of course, be referred to an earlier period.</p>

<p>The ruins at <em>Majapáhit</em> and its vicinity are distinguished
by being principally, if not entirely, of burnt bricks, a circumstance
which justifies us in assigning an anterior date to most
of the edifices constructed of a different material. The date
found on the ruins at <em>Súku</em>, and some few other places, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1067" id="Page_1067">[Vol II Pg 67]</a></span>
be an exception to this rule; but the sculpture of these is
coarse and rude compared to the magnificent remains in stone
found elsewhere. On this account it is reasonable to conclude,
that the arts at that period had considerably declined.
The edifices and sculptures at <em>Sínga Sári</em> were probably executed
in the eighth or ninth century, that being the period of
the greatest splendour of this state; and as the style and decorations
of the buildings, as well as the execution of the
sculpture, appear very nearly to resemble those of <em>Brambánan</em>,
<em>Bóro Bódo</em>, &amp;c. it is probable that the whole were constructed
about the same period, or within the same century, or at any
rate between the sixth and ninth century of the Christian era.</p>

<p>From the extensive variety of temples and sculpture, as well
as from that of the characters found in the ancient inscriptions,
it is probable that Java has been colonized from different
parts of the continent of Asia.</p>

<p>The Budhist religion is by many deemed of higher antiquity
than what is now called the Braminical; and it seems
generally admitted, that the followers of <em>Budh</em> were driven
by the Bramins to the extremes of Asia and the islands adjacent.
The Jains and Budhists had probably the same
worship originally, from which the Bramins or priests may
have separated, after the manner in which it has been said
the Jesuits of Europe once aimed at universal empire; and
when we consider that the religion of <em>Budh</em>, or some modification
of it, is still the prevailing worship of Ceylon, Ava,
Siam, China, and Japan, we are not surprized to find indications
of its former establishment on Java.</p>

<p>To trace the coincidences of the arts, sciences, and letters
of ancient Java, and those of Egypt, Greece, and Persia,
would require more time and more learning than I can command.
Such investigations I must leave to the reader, deeming
myself fortunate, if in recording their vestiges in the traces
of a high state of civilization, to be found in the ruins, languages,
poetry, history, and institutions of Java, I have succeeded
in obtaining any share of his interest and respect for
a people whom I shall myself ever consider with peculiar

<p>In the archives of the princes of Java are deposited histories
of their country, extending from a remote antiquity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1068" id="Page_1068">[Vol II Pg 68]</a></span>
the latest date. It is principally from abstracts of these, made
at my request, in three different parts of the country, by the
<em>Panambáhan</em> of <em>Súmenap</em>, the late <em>Kiái Adipáti</em> of <em>Demak</em>,
and the secretary of the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em> of <em>Súra-kérta</em>, all
distinguished among their countrymen for literary attainments,
that the two following chapters have been compiled.
The abstract presented by the <em>Kiái Adipáti</em> of <em>Demák</em> being
the most continuous, forms the main stream of the narrative.</p>

<p>Copies, versions, and detached fragments of history, are
found in the possession of every family of distinction. Of
these I have occasionally availed myself.</p>

<p>So much of the native accounts as relates to the period
anterior to the establishment of the empire of <em>Jang'gala</em>, in
the ninth century, is confused, obscure, contradictory, and interpolated
with the fabulous and heroical histories of continental
India; but from that epoch they correspond essentially,
and from the subversion of Paganism (A.D. 1475) they are
circumstantial, and claim attention, not only as illustrative of
the character of the people, but as historical records of the
transactions of the times. Much abridgment has been requisite:
the passages between inverted commas are however
literal translations from the native writings; and those so distinguished,
subsequent to the arrival of the Dutch, are from
the original histories. In the course of the narrative, a Dutch
abstract of the native history, by Mr. Middlecoop, has occasionally
been consulted.</p>

<p>Besides these historical relations, called <em>Bábat</em>, as <em>Bábat
Jang'gála</em>, <em>Bábat Matárem</em>, &amp;c. the native princes and chiefs
have been in the habit of keeping a register of the principal
events, in the form of a chronological table. These are not
very consistent in what regards events anterior to the Mahomedan
conversion. From these tables is formed that which
is annexed to the following history. All that is subsequent
to the establishment of <em>Matárem</em> is translated from the records
of the court of <em>Suru-kérta</em>.</p>

nature, and although they do not easily forget or forgive an injury,
they would be a quiet well disposed people under good laws and a mild
government. The murders, and other crimes, which are now committed
in some places, are to be attributed more to the present faulty administration

remarked of the indolence and indifference which now characterize

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>The History of Java from the earliest Traditions till the Establishment of
Mahomedanism.</em></p></div>


<p>Amongst the various traditions regarding the manner in
which Java and the Eastern Islands were originally peopled,
and the source whence its population proceeded, it has been
related, that the first inhabitants came in vessels from the
Red Sea (<em>Láut Míra</em>), and that, in their passage, they coasted
along the shores of Hindustan; that peninsula then forming
an unbroken continent with the land in the Indian Archipelago,
from which it is now so widely separated, and which,
according to the tradition, has since been divided into so
many distinct islands, by some convulsions of nature or revolution
of the elements<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>.</p>

<p>These people are supposed to have been banished from
Egypt, and to have consisted of individuals professing different
religious persuasions, who carried along with them to the
land of their exile, their different modes of worship and
articles of belief. Some are said to have adored the sun,
others the moon; some the elements of fire or water, and
others the trees of the forest. Like all other uncivilized men,
they were addicted to the arts of divination, and particularly
to the practice of astrology. In other respects, they are described
as savages, living in hordes, without fixed habitations,
without the protection of regular government, or the restraint
of established law. Respect for age was the only substitute
for civil obedience. The oldest man of the horde was considered
its chief, and regulated its simple movements, or prescribed
its political duties. When the crop was gathered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1070" id="Page_1070">[Vol II Pg 70]</a></span>
the accustomed devotions performed, it was he who appointed
the mode and time of its departure from one place to another.
On these occasions, the horde, after offering their sacrifices
and feasting in an open plain, left the remains of their repast
to attract the bird called <em>úlunggága</em><a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>; and the young men
shook the <em>ángklung</em><a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>, and set up a shout in imitation of its cry.
If the bird did not eat of the meal offered to it, or if it afterwards
remained hovering in the air, perched quietly on a tree,
or in its flight took a course opposite to that which the horde
wished to pursue, their departure was deferred, and their
prayers and sacrifices renewed<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>. But when the bird, having
eaten of its meal, flew in the direction of their intended journey,
the ceremony was concluded by slaying and burning a
lamb, a kid, or the young of some other animal, as an offering
of gratitude to the deity; and for the favourable omen a second
feast was enjoyed, which ended with the most violent demonstrations
of joy, the whole party dancing and springing to the
music of the <em>ángklung</em>. Every thing being arranged for the
journey, the eldest of the horde, with his wife and children,
were either placed upon an elephant, or carried in a litter
shaded by mats; the rest moved on foot, preceded by young
men and boys, shaking the <em>ángklung</em> and shouting aloud, for
the double purpose of doing homage to the chief and of
frightening away the wild beasts, which at that time abounded
in the island<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1071" id="Page_1071">[Vol II Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is only from the supposed arrival of <em>Adi</em> or <em>Aji Sáka</em>,
that the Javans, even in their traditions, enter with any confidence
into details. This event is generally referred to the
first year of the Javan era, which corresponds with the
seventy-fifth of the Christian era, and in some accounts is thus
related.</p>

<p>"<em>Prábu Jáya Báya</em> was a great and powerful prince of
<em>Astína</em>, and the fifth in descent from <em>Arjúna</em>, the son of
<em>Pándu Déwa Náta</em>; after whom had reigned successively,
<em>Bimányu</em>, <em>Parakísit</em>, <em>Udayána</em>, and <em>Gandra Yána</em>. His
<em>Peng'gáwa</em>, or chief minister, being a man of great enterprize
and ability, was sent to visit and civilize foreign countries.
In the course of his travels, he landed on Java, then
the abode of a race of <em>Rasáksa</em>, and known by the name of
<em>Núsa Kéndang</em>. This happened in the first year of the
Javan era, and is distinguished in the <em>Chándra Sangkála</em>
by the words, <em>nir</em>, <em>ábu</em>, <em>tánpo</em>, <em>jálar</em>, meaning literally,
'nothing dust, not any thing (but) man,' and metaphorically
the figures 0001.</p>

<p>"He here discovered the grain called <em>jáwa-wut</em>, at that
time the principal subsistence of the inhabitants; and, in
consequence of this discovery, he changed the name of the
country from <em>Núsa Kéndang</em> to <em>Núsa Jáwa</em>. In his progress
through the island he met with the dead bodies of two
<em>Rasáksa</em>, each holding a leaf with an inscription on it, one
in <em>púrwa</em>, (ancient), the other in Siamese characters: these
he united, and thus formed the Javan alphabet of twenty
letters.</p>

<p>"He had several combats with the <em>Rasáksa</em>, particularly
with one <em>Dewáta Chéngkar</em>; and after fixing the date of
his different discoveries, and leaving mementos of his visit
wherever he went, he finally returned to <em>Astína</em>, and delivered
to his sovereign a written account of all he had seen
and done."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1072" id="Page_1072">[Vol II Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>The accounts of the real character of <em>Aji Sáka</em> are various.
Some represent him as a great and powerful prince, who established
an extensive colony on Java, which a pestilence afterwards
obliged him to withdraw; whilst others consider him
as a saint and deity, and believe that on his voyage to Java
he sailed over mountains, islands, and continents. Most, however,
agree in attributing to him the first introduction of letters,
government, and religion; the only trace of anterior civilization
being a tradition, that before his time there existed a judicial
code, under the title of sun and moon, the punishments
of which appear not to have been severe: a thief was bound
to make restitution of the property stolen, and to pay in addition
a fine in cattle or produce; and if the theft was considerable,
he became the slave of the injured party or his relations,
without, however, being transferable to another master: murder
was not punished by death, but by a heavy fine, and perpetual
servitude in the family of the deceased. This code
<em>Aji Sáka</em> is represented to have reformed; and an abstract
collection of ordinances, said to have been made from his instructions,
is believed to have been in use as late as the time
of <em>Janggála</em> (A.D. 900), and even of <em>Majapáhit</em> (A.D. 1300).</p>

<p>In the Sanscrit language <em>Sáka</em> means an era, and is applied
to the founder of an era; and in the chronology of the Hindu
princes of India, <em>Sáka</em> is a name or title, which has so often
been assumed, that it is sufficient to say to whom it is most
appropriately due. According to Sir William Jones, <em>Sáka</em> is
a name of <em>Budha</em>. In the chronology of the kings of <em>Magádha</em><a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>,
by Major Wilford, the Hindus are stated to have
divided the <em>Kaliyúga</em> into six unequal portions, or subordinate
periods, called <em>Sákas</em>, because they derived their origin from
six <em>Sákas</em>, or mighty and glorious monarchs, of whom three
have already made their appearance and three are still expected.
The third <em>Sáka</em> was <em>Salavahana</em>, who is believed to
have lived at the same time with our Saviour, and is represented
to have corresponded with him in some of the principal
features of his life. The era which bears his name commenced
from his death (namely, seventy-eight years after the Christian
era), and is doubtless that adopted by the Javans, which corresponds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1073" id="Page_1073">[Vol II Pg 73]</a></span>with it within about three years: and the slight
difference between them may be accounted for, by the introduction
of the Mahomedan mode of reckoning during the last
three centuries.</p>

<p>The same writer informs us, that the first <em>Bála Rája</em>, a title
peculiarly given to the ancient sovereigns of <em>Guj'rat</em>, and
who is supposed to have lived in the seventh century of the
Christian era, was called <em>Di Sáka</em>, or <em>Déva Sáka</em>; which
being also one of the titles of <em>Salivahana</em>, might induce an
opinion that they were the same person, if, as Major Wilford
acknowledges, the confusion and uncertainty of the Hindu
records did not almost deter us from forming any fixed opinion
whatever. According to the Japanese historians, <em>Sáka</em> lived
a thousand years before our Saviour; and the worship of that
country is still denominated by them the religion of <em>Sáka</em> or
<em>Siáka</em><a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>According, however, to a prophetic chronology of the Javans,
which is now in the possession of the <em>Susuhúnan</em>, and is
ascribed to the pen of the <em>Aji Jáya Báya</em>, but is doubtless
of a more modern composition, the supposed arrival of <em>Aji
Sáka</em> did not take place till after the year 1000. In this chronology,
the author himself is described as sovereign of <em>Kedíri</em>
in the year 800 of the Javan era.</p>

<p>"What was first known of Java," says this account, "was
a range of hills, called <em>Gúnung Kéndang</em>, which extends
along the north and south coasts; it was then that the
island first came into notice, and at that period commenced
the Javan era.</p>

<p>"After this the Prince of <em>Rom</em> sent twenty thousand
families to people Java; but all of them perished, except
twenty families, who returned to <em>Rom</em>.</p>

<p>"In this year, twenty thousand families were sent to Java
by the Prince of <em>Klíng</em> (India). These people prospered
and multiplied. They continued, however, in an uncivilized
state till the year 289, when the Almighty blessed
them with a prince, named <em>Káno</em>, who reigned for one hundred
years, at the end of which period he was succeeded by
<em>Básu Kéti</em>. The name of the sovereignty was called <em>Wiráta</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1074" id="Page_1074">[Vol II Pg 74]</a></span><em>Básu Kéti</em> dying, he was succeeded by his son, <em>Mángsa
Páti</em>. The father and son together reigned three hundred
years.</p>

<p>"Another principality, named <em>Astína</em>, sprung up at this
time, and was ruled by a prince, called <em>Púla Sára</em> who was
succeeded by his son <em>Abiása</em>, who was again succeeded by
his son <em>Pándu Déwa Náta</em>; the reigns of the last three
princes together amounting to one hundred years.</p>

<p>"Then succeeded <em>Jáya Báya</em> himself, who removed the
seat of government from <em>Astína</em> to <em>Kedíri</em>.</p>

<p>"The kingdom of <em>Kedíri</em> being dismembered on the death
of its sovereign, there arose out of its ruins two other kingdoms,
the one called <em>Brambánan</em>, of which the prince was
called <em>Báka</em>; the other <em>Péng'ging</em>, of which the prince's
name was <em>Angling Dría</em>.</p>

<p>"These two princes having gone to war with each other,
<em>Báka</em> was killed in battle by <em>Dámar Máya</em>, the son-in-law
of <em>Angling Dría</em>. On the death of <em>Báka</em>, the kingdom of
<em>Brambánan</em> was without a prince, and continued so, till
<em>Angling Dría</em> dying a natural death, <em>Dámar Máya</em> succeeded
him and ruled the country.</p>

<p>"<em>Dámar Máya</em> dying, and the sovereignty becoming extinct,
there arrived from a foreign country a person named
<em>Aji Sáka</em>, who established himself as Prince of <em>Méndang

<p>In some accounts it is stated, that the religion and arts of
India were first introduced into Java by a Bramin named
<em>Tritrésta</em>, who with numerous followers landed on Java about
this period, and established the era, in consequence of which
he is considered the same with <em>Aji Sáka</em>. The descendants
of <em>Tritrésta</em> are accordingly said to have succeeded to the
government of the country; and a list of eighteen princes
is adduced, to bring down the history to the ninth century, in
which the empire of <em>Jang'gála</em> was established. From these
accounts, with some minute details regarding the different
adventurers, who are supposed to have arrived during the
three first centuries, it has been inferred, that these were probably
followers of the religion of <em>Búdha</em>, and that those who
crowded to Java, about the close of the fifth century, are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1076" id="Page_1076">[Vol II Pg 76]</a></span>
be considered as the first settlers professing the Braminical
faith; but whatever authority this inference may derive from
the knowledge we possess of the religious revolutions which
have taken place elsewhere, and however probable it may be,
that the followers of <em>Búdha</em> were at an early period established
on Java, we apprehend that the conclusion will
derive but little support from a chronology which, on the
slightest investigation, will be found borrowed from continental
India. Even the names of the principal characters,
who are thus represented as having ruled Java for a period of
so many centuries, will be readily traced in the accredited
lists of Indian sovereigns<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>; and when it is considered, that
the princes of Java pretend to derive their descent from
<em>Parakísit</em>, the descendant of <em>Arjúna</em>, that the scene of the
celebrated war of the <em>Pandáwa</em>, which forms the subject of
the most popular poem in the country, as well as that of the
great Indian poem, called the <em>Mahabárat</em>, is believed to have
been laid on Java, and that not only the countries mentioned
in that war, but the dwelling places and temples of the different
heroes who distinguished themselves in it, are at the
present day pointed out on Java, it is easy to account for the
indistinctness and inaccuracy of the line drawn between
the princes of India and those who may have actually ruled
on Java.</p>

<p>Without entering into the mythology of the ancient Javans,
which has been more particularly treated of in another place,
it may be sufficient to observe generally, that in some of the
copies of the <em>Níti Sástra Káwí</em>, a work of the highest antiquity
and celebrity, the following is the duration prescribed
for the several ages of the world.</p>

<p>"The <em>kérta yóga</em> was of one hundred thousand years
duration; the <em>tréta yóga</em> was of ten thousand years; the
<em>duapára</em> was of one thousand years; the <em>sandiníka</em> (which
began A.D. 78) is now in its course."</p>

<p>The <em>kérta yóga</em> is considered to have terminated with the
expulsion of <em>Víshnu</em> from <em>Suraláya</em>. The <em>tréta yóga</em> commences
with his becoming incarnate in the person of <em>Arjúna
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1077" id="Page_1077">[Vol II Pg 77]</a></span>Wijáya</em>, sovereign of <em>Mauspáti</em>, and ends with the death of
<em>Ráma</em>, an event supposed to have taken place about the time
of <em>Sákri</em>, in the following line of princes.</p>


<ul><li><em>Mánu Manása,</em></li>
<li><em>Tritrésta,</em></li>
<li><em>Parikéna,</em></li>
<li><em>Sutápa,</em></li>
<li><em>Sapútram,</em></li>
<li><em>Sákri,</em></li>
<li><em>Pulasára,</em></li>
<li><em>Abiása,</em></li>
<li><em>Pándu Déwa Náta.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these princes, with their descendants, are in the
traditionary accounts of the country, believed to have established
themselves on Java; and while we find <em>Tritrésta</em>
founding a colony in the first year of the Javan era, or about
seventeen hundred and forty years ago, it is the less surprising
that the war of the <em>Pándus</em> should have been transferred
from the <em>duapára yóga</em> to the present age, and believed to
have taken place in Java about twelve hundred years ago.</p>

<p>In the Javan, or modern version of the <em>Níti Sástra</em>, the
following periods are assigned to the principal events of
fabulous history. "In the beginning every thing was at rest
and quiet. During the first years, kings began to start up,
and wars arose about a woman named <em>Déwi Darúki</em>; at
this period writing was introduced. One thousand five
hundred years after this, another war began, about a woman
named <em>Déwi Sínta</em>. Two thousand years after this, a third
war broke out about a woman named <em>Déwi Drupádi</em>; and
two thousand five hundred years afterwards another war
took place, about the daughter of a spiritual man, not
named in history."</p>

<p>The following account of princes, commencing with <em>Tritrésta</em>,
who is believed to have established his government at
<em>Gíling Wési</em>, at the foot of the mountain <em>Se Míru</em>, with the
dynasties which they severally established, and the dates at
which they respectively succeeded to the government, while
it shews the manner in which these islanders have interwoven
their fabulous history with that of the continent, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1078" id="Page_1078">[Vol II Pg 78]</a></span>
prove how little credit is due to those accounts, which furnish
local details during a period so remote and obscure.</p>

<p>This account is extracted from a collection of the legends
of the country, compiled by <em>Náta Kasúma</em>, the present
<em>Panambáhan</em> of <em>Súmenap</em>; a man who is not only distinguished
among the Javans for his eminent erudition and
information, but who, from the superior endowments of his
mind, would command a high degree of respect among the
more civilized people of Europe.</p>

<p>"Before there were any inhabitants on Java, <em>Wísnu</em>
(Vishnu) presided therein; but having offended <em>Sang yáng
Gúru</em>, <em>Tritrésta</em>, the son of <em>Jála Prási</em>, and grandson of
<em>Bráma</em>, was sent to Java as sovereign of the country. This
prince was married, at ten years of age, to <em>Bramáni Káli</em>,
of <em>Kámbója</em>, and with eight hundred families from the
country of <em>Kling</em>, established the seat of his government at
the foot or <em>Gúnung Semíru</em>, the capital of which he called
<em>Gíling Wési</em>. He had two sons, <em>Mánu Manása</em>, and <em>Mánu
Madéwa</em>, and his people increased to 20,000.</p>

<p>"In the country of <em>Kling</em> there was a man named <em>Watu
Gúnung</em>, son of <em>Gána</em>, of <em>Désa Sangála</em>, who heard of the
fame of <em>Sínta</em> and <em>Lándap</em>, two beautiful women residing
at <em>Gíling Wési</em>. <em>Wátu Gúnung</em> went in search of them,
and finding them under the protection of <em>Tritrésta</em>, attacked
and defeated him. <em>Tritrésta</em> was slain, and <em>Wátu Gúnung</em>
reigned as sovereign of <em>Gíling Wési</em> for one hundred and
forty years. Under his government the country became
very flourishing. He adopted forty sons and as many
daughters of the princes of the country, and gave them the
names of the deities of <em>Súrga</em> (Swerga), for which, and for
other acts, he was in the end punished with death by <em>Wísnu</em>,
in the year 240<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.</p>

<p>"After this <em>Batára Gúru</em> sent <em>Gutáka</em> from the mountain
<em>Sawéla Chála</em> in <em>Kling</em>, to be sovereign of <em>Gíling Wési</em>,
where, after a reign of fifty years, he died, and was succeeded
by his son, <em>Ráden Sawéla</em>, in the year 290. This
last prince reigned twenty years, and was succeeded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1079" id="Page_1079">[Vol II Pg 79]</a></span><em>Gutáma</em>, who removed from <em>Gíling Wési</em> while yet unmarried,
and went to a country (<em>Astína</em>), which was possessed
by an elephant that desired the princess <em>Endrádi</em> in marriage.
He fought and killed the elephant, and married the
princess, and afterwards proceeded to <em>Lagrestína</em>.</p>

<p>"There was a <em>Pandíta</em> of <em>Gúnung Jáli</em>, in the country of
<em>Kling</em>, who had a son called <em>Ráden Dása Wirià</em>, who, when
twelve years of age, having obtained leave of his father to go
to Java, took up his abode at the foot of the mountain <em>Láwu</em>.
His son, <em>Dása Báhu</em>, when ten years of age, determined to
make himself independent, and travelled with one hundred
followers, until they smelt the dead elephant which had
been killed by <em>Gutáma</em>. There he established himself,
calling his capital <em>Gája-huia</em>, or <em>Astíná Púra</em>. This was
in the year 310.</p>

<p>"<em>Dása Báhu</em> was succeeded by his son <em>Suantána</em>, who
had wars with the giant <em>Púru Sáda</em>. This prince had a
son, named <em>Déwa Bráta</em>, whose mother died immediately
after the birth of the child; and the prince finding no one
from whom the child would take milk, was obliged to carry
it about in search of some one to whom it might take a
liking.</p>

<p>"Of the descendants of <em>Tritrésta</em> were first, <em>Mánu Manása</em>;
second, <em>Sutápa</em>; third, <em>Sapútram</em>; fourth, <em>Sákri</em>. The
last begot <em>Púla Sara</em>, who had a son named <em>Abiása</em>. It
happened that <em>Abiása</em>, when an infant, was borne in the
arms of his mother <em>Ambu Sári</em>, at the time when <em>Suantána</em>
was in search of a wet nurse for his son. Upon seeing her
the infant <em>Déwa</em> immediately cried out and wanted milk
from her, which, however, she would not consent to give,
until after much altercation <em>Suantána</em> agreed to give his
country in exchange; so that <em>Ambu Sári</em> received the
country of <em>Astína</em> for her son <em>Abiása</em>, who, when arrived
at a proper age, succeeded as sovereign in the year 415.
<em>Déwa Bráta</em> was made Prince of <em>Kumbína</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Abiása</em> was married to a woman advanced in years, by
whom he had three sons: <em>Drésta Ráta</em>, who was blind;
<em>Pándu Déwa Náta</em>, who was very handsome; and <em>Ráma
Widára</em>, who was lame. After twelve years he retired, and
transferred the government to his second son.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1080" id="Page_1080">[Vol II Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>Pándu Déwa Náta</em>, at the age of fourteen, then succeeded
as sovereign of <em>Astína</em>, and married <em>Déwi Kúnti</em>,
daughter of <em>Básu Keti</em>, Prince of <em>Madúra</em>, by whom he
had three sons, <em>Kúnta Déwa</em>, <em>Séna</em>, and <em>Jináka</em>. <em>Déwa
Náta</em> also married <em>Madrín</em>, daughter of the Prince of <em>Mandarága</em>,
and died, leaving her pregnant. She was delivered
of two sons, and died also; but <em>Déwi Kúnti</em> gave the children
milk, and called the one <em>Sadéwa</em> and the other <em>Nakúla</em>.
At that time the children of <em>Pándu Déwa Náta</em>
were very young; <em>Drésta Ráta</em> was therefore nominated
protector during their minority; but instead of resigning
the kingdom to them, he gave it to his own son, <em>Suyudána</em>;
who, becoming sovereign of <em>Astína</em>, the five children were
sent by <em>Abiása</em>, with a thousand families, to establish a new
country, to which they gave the name of <em>Amérta</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Suyudána</em> married the daughter of the Prince of <em>Mandarága</em>,
by whom he had a son, and the country became great,
flourishing, and happy. There was none more powerful;
and the dependant chiefs were the Princes <em>Kérna</em> of
<em>Awáng'ga</em>, <em>Bísma</em> or <em>Déwa Kráta</em>, of <em>Kúmbina</em>, <em>Jáya
Páta</em> of <em>Dála Sejána</em>, <em>Jákar Sána</em> of <em>Madúra</em>, and <em>Sália</em>,
of <em>Mandarága</em>. But <em>Púnta Déwa</em> and his brothers in the
country of <em>Amerta</em> were not satisfied: they wished for their
father's inheritance, and sent their cousin, <em>Krésna</em> of <em>Diarawáti</em>,
to confer with <em>Suyudána</em>, and to demand their rightful
possessions. For the sake of peace with their cousin,
they offered to accept of half: but <em>Suyudána</em> rejected their
demand and replied, 'that without the decision of the
sword they should have none.' Then began the war
called <em>Bráta Yúdha</em>, because it was a contest for their just
rights. The war lasted long, and during its continuance
the sons and followers of both parties were nearly all killed:
at last <em>Suyudána</em> himself fell, after a reign of fifty years<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>.</p>

<p>"<em>Púnta Déwa</em> then became sovereign of <em>Astína</em> in the
year 491; but after two years he transferred the government
to <em>Parikísit</em>, son of <em>Abimányu</em>, and grandson of his
brother <em>Jenáka</em>. After defending the country successfully
against the giant <em>Usi Aji</em>, of <em>Surabáya</em>, whom he slew, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1081" id="Page_1081">[Vol II Pg 81]</a></span>
was succeeded by his son <em>Udayána</em>, who died after a reign
of twenty-three years. His son <em>Jáya Dérma</em> succeeded.
This prince had two sons, named <em>Jáya Misána</em> and <em>Ang'ling
Dérma</em>. The former succeeded his father after a reign
of twenty-seven years, and died at the expiration of five
years. During the reign of <em>Jáya Misána</em> there was a dreadful
pestilence and a violent earthquake, which destroyed
the country, and his son removed to <em>Miláwa</em>, where he became
a <em>tápa</em>.</p>

<p>"To this country <em>Ang'ling Dérmá</em>  had already removed
with three thousand families, during the lifetime of his
brother, and was acknowledged as sovereign of <em>Miláwa
Páti</em>, where he reigned in prosperity for ten years. At the
expiration of this period, it is related that his princess
burnt herself, in consequence of being refused the knowledge
of a certain prayer, by which she might understand
the language of all animals. The prince afterwards became
insane, wandered about, and was transformed into a
white bird.</p>

<p>"The son of <em>Jáya Misána</em>, <em>Jáya Purúsa</em>, begat <em>Púspa
Jáya</em>, who begat <em>Púspa Wijáya</em>, who begat <em>Kasúma
Wíchítra</em>, who again begat <em>Ráden Aji Nirmála</em>, who reigned
for twenty years at <em>Miláwa Pati</em>, but in whose days the
country was greatly afflicted with pestilence. In consequence
of this, his son, <em>Bisúra Champáka</em>, departed with
his followers, and proceeded to <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>, where
he abode as a <em>Pandíta</em>. He had, however, a son, named
<em>Ang'ling Dérma</em>, from whom descended <em>Aji Jáya Báya</em>,
who became sovereign of the country, and gave it the name
of <em>Púrwa Chiríta</em>; under his government the country greatly
increased, he acquired large possessions, and all under his
administration was flourishing and happy. It is related of
him, that he dictated the poem of the <em>Bráta Yúdha</em>, by
order of <em>Déwa Batára Gúru</em>, in the year 701. He was
succeeded by his son, <em>Salápar Wáta</em>, in 756, whose son,
named <em>Kandiáwan</em>, afterwards came to the government,
under the title of <em>Jáyu Langkára</em>. This last named prince
had a sister, called <em>Chándra Suára</em>, four sons, <em>Subráta</em>,
<em>Pára Yáta</em>, <em>Játa Wída</em>, and <em>Su Wída</em>, and a daughter,
named <em>Pambáyun</em>. His <em>Páteh</em> was named <em>Jáya Singára</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1082" id="Page_1082">[Vol II Pg 82]</a></span>
and among his dependents were <em>Gaja Iráwan</em> of <em>Ludáya</em>,
<em>Lémbu Súren Gúna</em> of <em>Jang'gála</em>, <em>Wíra Tíkta</em> of <em>Kedíri</em>,
and the <em>Arias</em> of <em>Síng'a Sári</em> and <em>Ng'ráwan</em>.</p>

<p>"In course of time this prince became very wicked, and
married his sister, <em>Chándra Suára</em>. When his <em>Páteh</em>,
chiefs, and followers, heard of it, they rose in arms, but
feared to attack the prince, as it had been predicted that he
could only be killed at the full of the moon. The prince,
in the mean time, being informed of the conspiracy, immediately
attacked the party, and killing the <em>Páteh</em>, committed
great slaughter among his followers.</p>

<p>"When the battle was over, he assembled his sons, and
after telling them they were not ignorant of his deeds, and
that it was his intention to burn himself at the full of the
moon, he desired that they would thereupon remove from
the place, and leave the country of <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em> to
become a wilderness. He then divided his possessions into
four parts: to the eldest son, <em>Subráta</em>, he gave the country
of <em>Jang'gála</em>; to his second son, <em>Pára Yára</em>, he gave
<em>Kedíri</em>; to his third, <em>Játa Wída</em> he gave <em>Síng'a Sári</em>; and
to his fourth son, <em>Su Wída</em>, he gave <em>Ng'aráwan</em>: and these
princes severally became independent chiefs of those kingdoms.</p>

<p>"When the full of the moon arrived, <em>Sri Jáya Langkára</em>,
with his wife and sister, <em>Chándra Suára</em>, went to the
<em>Sáng'gar</em> of <em>Déwa Pabayústan</em>, where they burnt themselves.
The families of the <em>Páteh</em> and the chiefs slain in
the late battle also accompanied him, and committed themselves
to the flames. <em>Pembáyun</em>, his daughter, was not
however permitted to sacrifice herself, in consequence of
which she bore great ill will to her father; and it is related
that she is the same person who afterwards went to
<em>Jáng'gála</em>, and abode at <em>Wána Kapucháng'an</em>, where she
assumed the name of <em>Kíli Súchi</em>, and went about from
place to place, being much beloved; for she was very
learned, and made inscriptions upon stones, one of which
is called <em>Kála Kérma</em><a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1083" id="Page_1083">[Vol II Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>But other accounts, which attempt to draw a line between
the Indian and Javan princes, date the commencement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1084" id="Page_1084">[Vol II Pg 84]</a></span>latter, five centuries subsequently to the first landing of the
<em>Aji Sáka</em>, and consider the kingdom of <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>
as the first regular establishment on Java. As these, if not
the most consistent with the historical data which have been
admitted on continental India, have the advantage of being
the least confused, a more particular account of the first establishments
may be interesting. With regard to the statements
that commence with a more remote antiquity, it may be sufficient
to shew, at one view, the line of princes who are represented
to have ruled on Java, according to the two different
authorities which have been referred to.

<p>"When <em>Prábu Jáya Báya</em> of <em>Astína</em> died, he was succeeded
by his son and descendants, named <em>Ami Jáya</em>,
<em>Jaya Ami Sána</em>, <em>Páncha Dría</em>, and <em>Kasúma Chitra</em>.
During the reign of the last of these princes, either the
seat of government had been removed, or the country had
changed its name, for it was then called <em>Kúj'rat</em> or <em>Gúj'rat</em>;
and it having been foretold that it would decay and go to
ruin altogether, the prince resolved to send his son<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1088" id="Page_1088">[Vol II Pg 88]</a></span><em>Jáwa</em>, and possessing the written account of <em>Aji Sáka</em>,
which had been preserved in his family, he gave it to his
son, and embarked him with about five thousand followers
for that island. Among these followers were <em>Jálma-táni</em>,
<em>Jálma-undági</em>, <em>Jálma-újam-dudúkan</em>, <em>Jálma-pangniárik</em>,
<em>Jálma-prajúrit</em>; that is to say, people skilled in agriculture,
artificers, men learned in medicine, able writers, and
military men.</p>

<p>"They sailed in six large ships and upwards of a hundred
small vessels, and after a voyage of four months reached
what they conceived to be the island of <em>Jáwa</em>, and many
landed; but as it did not accord with the account given by
<em>Aji Sáka</em>, they re-embarked. In a few months, however,
they came in sight of an island with a long range of mountains,
and some of them, with the prince at their head,
effected a landing at the western extremity, while a part
were driven to the southward. They soon met with the
grain <em>jáwa-wut</em>, as described by <em>Aji Sáka</em>, and ascertained
that they had at last reached their destination: then
opening the book of <em>Aji Sáka</em>, the days of the week and
the <em>panchawára</em><a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> were named. The prince, however, did
not long remain in this part of the island; for on clearing
the forest, a lingering sickness appeared among his followers,
and many died from drinking the water: so he
moved to the south and east, in quest of a more salubrious
position, and with the hope of falling in with their companions.
These they found at that part of the island now
known by the name of <em>Matárem</em>, when the high priest
opening the book of <em>Aji Sáka</em>, and referring to the prophecy,
that <em>Jáwa</em> should become an inheritance to the
descendants of <em>Prábu Jáya Báya</em>, he summoned the whole
party together, and formally proclaimed the prince sovereign
of the country, under the title of <em>Browijáya Sawéla Chála</em>.
The name of <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em> was then given to the
seat of government.</p>

<p>"The prince now found that men alone were wanting to
render it a great and flourishing state, and he accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1089" id="Page_1089">[Vol II Pg 89]</a></span>
applied to <em>Gúj'-rat</em> for assistance. The ambassadors whom
he sent proceeded down the river and embarked at <em>Grésik</em>, so
called from <em>Gíri-sik</em>, in consequence of the hills (<em>Gíri</em>) running
in this part of the island close to the sea shore (<em>sik</em>);
and when they reached <em>Gúj-rat</em>, the father of <em>Sawéla Chala</em>,
delighted to hear of his success, immediately sent him a
reinforcement of two thousand people. The kindred and
friends of the new colonists were permitted to proceed in
great numbers to <em>Jáwa</em>, where they established themselves
principally in the southern and eastern provinces. The
prince lost no time in improving his capital, which became
an extensive city in the year 525. From this period <em>Jáwa</em>
was known and celebrated as a kingdom: an extensive
commerce was carried on with <em>Gúj'rat</em> and other countries,
and the bay of <em>Matárem</em>, then a safe place for shipping,
was filled with adventurers from all parts."</p>

<p>In some of the accounts, the father of <em>Sawéla Chála</em> is
named <em>Bália Achar</em>; and previously to the establishment of
<em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>, <em>Sawela  Chéla</em> himself is usually known
by the name of <em>Awap</em>.</p>

<p>"Nothing, however, is represented to have tended more
to the prosperity of this establishment, than a supposed
union which is said to have taken place between the family
of <em>Sawéla Chála</em> and that of <em>Aru Bándan</em>, a prince who had
recently arrived from the Moluccas, and established himself
on <em>Balambángan</em>. Hearing of the arrival of <em>Sawéla Chála</em>,
this prince, with his followers, proceeded to <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>
and submitted to his authority, on condition that the
eastern provinces, including <em>Balambángan</em>, should be confirmed
to him and his descendants. According to the tradition
of the country, this prince was principally induced
to submit, in consequence of the other party being able to
explain the inscription and signs of <em>Aji Sáka</em>, which he
himself could not, and in consequence of the production of
the writings, in which it was prophesied that the country
should become the inheritance of the family of this prince.</p>

<p>"<em>Sawéla Chála</em>, after a long and prosperous reign, was
succeeded by his son, <em>Ardi Kasúma</em>; and he again, on his
death, by his son, named <em>Ardi Wijáya</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1090" id="Page_1090">[Vol II Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"During the sovereignty of these princes, the country advanced
in fame and prosperity, and the city of <em>Méndang
Kamúlan</em>, since called <em>Brambánan</em> or <em>Prambánan</em>, increased
in size and splendour. Artists, particularly in
stone and metals, arrived from distant countries; the temples,
of which the ruins are still extant, both at this place
and at <em>Bóro Bódo</em> in <em>Kédu</em>, are stated to have been constructed
during this period, by artists invited from India;
and the remains of the palace, situated on a range of low
hills near the site of the thousand temples, still attest the
existence of this first capital of Java.</p>

<p>"<em>Ardi Wijáya</em> had five sons, besides a numerous illegitimate
offspring. The eldest was appointed chief of the class
of cultivators, the second of the traders, the third to the
charge of the woods and forests, the fourth chief of the manufacturers
of oil, sugar, and spirits, and the fifth, named
<em>Rési Déndang Géndis</em>, remained as assistant to his father.</p>

<p>"When this prince died, his youngest son, <em>Rési Déndang
Géndis</em>, found himself in charge of the capital, and invested
with the general administration of the country; but his brothers
having formed independent governments in other parts
of the island, refused to acknowledge his supremacy. One
of them was established at <em>Bágalen</em>, another at <em>Japára</em>,
and a third at <em>Kóripan</em>. He is said to have died of a
broken heart, in consequence of these secessions, leaving a
numerous progeny, who established themselves in different
parts of the country.</p>

<p>"The next prince who," according to these accounts, "appears
to have succeeded to the government of <em>Méndang
Kamúlan</em>, was <em>Déwa Kasúma</em>, who being of an ambitious
character, is said to have proceeded eastward, and established
the kingdom of <em>Jang'gála</em>, the capital of which, so
called from his attachment to the chace (<em>jang'gála</em> signifying
"a dog" in the Javan language) was built in the forest
of <em>Jeng'áwan</em>, a few miles to the eastward of the modern
<em>Surabáya</em>, where its site, with many interesting remains of
antiquity, is still pointed out. This event is supposed to
have taken place about the year 846."</p>

<p>Of the earlier history of Java it is probable, that each of
these three accounts contains some true particulars; but with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1091" id="Page_1091">[Vol II Pg 91]</a></span>out
unnecessarily discrediting the claims which that country
asserts to a higher antiquity, we must confess ourselves
unable, in the present state of our information, to separate
truth from fable, till we arrive at a period when its records
are more consistent. Unconnected with the line of princes
whose names have been brought forward, many small states,
petty dynasties, and separate interests, no doubt existed on
Java in earlier times: of which little mention is made by tradition,
which seldom busies itself, except with extensive and
sanguinary wars, or great political changes. Among these
may have flourished the celebrated <em>Jáya Báya</em>, in whose reign
the <em>Bráta Yúdha</em> is said to have been composed by the <em>Pandíta
Puséda</em>. In the account obtained from <em>Súra-kérta</em>, this
prince, as we have seen, is related to have reigned in the
eighth century in the country of <em>Kedíri</em>.</p>

<p>The temples at <em>Brambánan</em> (the extensive remains of
which, with the numerous casts in metal found in their vicinity,
prove the high state which the arts had attained in a remote
age, and afford incontestible evidence of the establishment
of the Hindu worship in the earliest periods of Javan
history), are stated in some accounts to have been constructed
in the year 525, and in others in the year 1018; but as far as
the general tradition may be relied on, it seems most probable
that they were the work of the sixth or seventh centuries.
This opinion derives confirmation from the fact, that during
this period idol worship increased in Japan. Abundance of
idols and idol carvers, and priests, arrived in that quarter
from several countries beyond sea; and local traditions assert,
that at that time similar emigrations first took place to Java
and the eastern islands<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1092" id="Page_1092">[Vol II Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Déwa Kasúma</em> is represented by the Javan writers to have
been a prince of great talent and enlarged views, and by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1093" id="Page_1093">[Vol II Pg 93]</a></span>mild and beneficent government to have induced many of his
relations to submit to his authority, which in a short time extended
over all the provinces eastward of <em>Jawána</em>. But the
most interesting fact related of him is, that he sent his children,
consisting of four sons and a daughter, to India <em>(Kling)</em>,
in order that they might there be educated and instructed in
the religion of <em>Bráma</em>; from whence the eldest son having
married the daughter of one of the greatest princes of the
country, returned to Java with three large ships, laden with
long cloth and other valuable manufactures, and bringing with
him able artists of different professions, and a thousand chosen
troops presented to him by his father-in-law as a body guard.
How far this relation is correct it may be difficult to determine;
and a suspicion may even be entertained, that it was a
fiction invented by national vanity, for the purpose of concealing
from posterity the successful invasion of foreign adventurers.
What we know for certain is, that during the reign of
the reputed sons of this prince, the Hindu religion, institutions,
and literature, with the ornaments of continental India,
were very generally introduced and diffused; and it is from
this date that we may speak with some degree of confidence
as to history.</p>

<p><em>Déwa Kasúma</em>, on the return of his children from India,
divided his kingdom among them. To the eldest, <em>Ami Luhúr</em>,
he gave the succession to Jang'gála, with a jurisdiction of
limited extent; to <em>Ami Jáya</em> he gave the country of <em>Gegélang</em>
or <em>Sínga Sari</em>; to <em>Lémbu Meng'árang</em> he gave the country
<em>N'garáwan</em> or <em>Browérno</em>, and to <em>Lémbu Ami Luhúr</em> he gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1094" id="Page_1094">[Vol II Pg 94]</a></span>the country of <em>Dahá</em> or <em>Kedíri</em>; so that, when he died, the
island of Java became divided into four kingdoms. His
daughter, who was the eldest of his children, and named
<em>Déwi Kilí Súchi</em>, remained unmarried, and performed a
conspicuous part in the transactions of those days. The
temples at <em>Síng'a Sari</em>, the ruins of which still remain, are
stated to have been constructed by that princess.</p>

<p>The reign of <em>Ami Luhúr</em> is celebrated for the extensive intercourse
which at this period took place with foreign nations,
and still more on account of the exploits and adventures of his
son, <em>Pánji Ino Kérta Páti</em>, the issue of his marriage with the
Indian princess, and who, under the name of <em>Pánji</em>, became
the most renowned hero of Javan story. The adventures of
<em>Pánji</em> are described in numerous romances, which form the
subject of still more numerous dramatic exhibitions, and constitute
a principal portion of the polite literature, as well as of
the popular amusement of Java. In these romances the hero
is represented as devoted to love and war. At an early age he
marries <em>Angréné</em> or <em>Sékar'táji</em>, the daughter of his father's <em>Pepati</em>,
to whom he is passionately attached. His father, desirous
of uniting him with his cousin, the daughter of the chief
of <em>Kedíri</em>, causes the first object of his affections to be put to
death. <em>Pánji</em> on this embarks with the dead body, and a
storm arising, most of the vessels which accompanied him
being lost, he is supposed to have perished. He, however,
reaches the island <em>Tanábang</em> in safety, and after
burning the body of his lamented <em>Angréne</em>, proceeds with
all the followers he can muster to <em>Báli</em>, where he assumes
the name of <em>Klána Jáyang Sári</em>. Having obtained
assistance from the prince of the island, <em>Andáya Prána</em>,
and received in marriage the princess his daughter, usually
known under the name of the <em>Pútri</em> or princess of <em>Báli</em>,
he crosses to <em>Balambángan</em>, the most eastern province
of Java, and also uniting in marriage with the princess of that
country, he obtains numerous auxiliaries, and moves westward
to <em>Kedíri</em>, in quest of the princess <em>Chándra Kirána</em>, the fame
of whose beauty and accomplishments had been widely celebrated.
Here, in consequence of his change of name, and the
general belief that he had perished in the storm, he is considered
as a powerful Raja from <em>Sábrang</em>, or the opposite shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1095" id="Page_1095">[Vol II Pg 95]</a></span>
and joining the chief of <em>Kedíri</em>, he secretly makes himself
known to his daughter, and marries her.</p>

<p>According to some of the romances, a prince from <em>Núsa
Kanchána</em>, or the Golden Isle, with numerous followers, and
accompanied by two princesses from <em>Núsa Rétna</em> arrives at
<em>Jang'gála</em> about this period, and giving himself out for the
long-lost <em>Pánji</em>, imposes on the credulity of the father, who
receives him as his son. This prince is represented as the
son of a <em>Bramána</em> possessing supernatural gifts, which enable
him to succeed in the deception, and is said to have been lord
of many rajas, among whom were <em>Báka</em>, <em>Mordáda</em>, and many
others who are named. He is reported to have had a sister,
named <em>Angréna Suára</em>, excelling in beauty, and in every respect
resembling the princess <em>Angréné</em>, who with her nurse
accompanied his four wives and numerous concubines to
Java.</p>

<p><em>Klána Jáyang Sári</em> now resuming his name as the real
<em>Pánji</em>, his father, the prince of <em>Jang'gála</em>, proceeded to <em>Kedíri</em>
with the auxiliaries brought over by the impostor, when a
combat takes place between the two princes, and the true
<em>Pánji</em> becomes manifest.</p>

<p>According to other accounts, the storm in which <em>Pánji</em> was
supposed to have perished, occurred when the princess <em>Angréné</em>
was living. She is cast on the <em>Báli</em> shore, where assuming a
male habit, and becoming a favourite of the prince, she in
time obtained the sovereignty of that island under the title of
<em>Jáya Ang'ling Dára</em>. <em>Pánji</em> is thrown on the south shore
of Java, and afterwards sent by his father to reduce the refractory
chief of <em>Báli</em>, in whom he recognizes <em>Angréné</em>. In another
romance his second wife, <em>Chándra Kirána</em>, is represented
as becoming chief of <em>Báli</em>, under the title of <em>Kuda Narawáng'a</em>.</p>

<p>It is also related, that, about this period the Prince of
<em>Sínga-sári</em> being attacked by the <em>Bálians</em> under <em>Klána
Ráng'ga Páspíta</em>, and defeated in an engagement near
<em>Arára Bidáli</em>, applied for assistance to <em>Jang'gála</em> and
<em>Browérno</em>. The forces sent as auxiliaries from <em>Jang'gála</em>,
were defeated, and it was not until the arrival of a celebrated
warrior from <em>Browérno</em>, that the <em>Bálians</em> were obliged to retreat.
The river which flowed by the scene of action still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1096" id="Page_1096">[Vol II Pg 96]</a></span>
bears the name <em>Káli Géti</em>, from its stream having been converted
into blood on this occasion.</p>

<p>With regard to the Raja of <em>Núsa Kanchána</em>, it is related
that he possessed very extensive influence over all the islands
of <em>Sábrang</em>. He is sometimes called <em>Klána Tánjung Púra</em>,
and said to have obtained his authority by means of a
<em>Bramána</em>, named <em>Kánda</em> or <em>Sakéndo</em>, and sometimes <em>Satírti</em>,
who performed a severe penance on the island <em>Tambína</em>.
His first establishment was at <em>Goa</em> on Celebes; afterwards
he attained supreme power: every island which he visited
submitted to his sway. He established himself on Sumatra,
in the country which has since been called <em>Palémbang</em>,
whence he waged war against Java, in order to obtain the
celebrated princess of <em>Dáha</em> in marriage. In other accounts,
again, this prince is supposed to have been the son of the
chief of <em>Browérno</em> on Java, carried off when an infant by a
<em>Bramána</em>, who left his own son in his place.</p>

<p>In the dramatic performances of the <em>Bálians</em>, <em>Klána Tánjung
Púra</em> is the same with <em>Si Maláyu</em>, which means a wanderer,
and from which it has been supposed probable that the
<em>Maláyus</em> have derived their name.</p>

<p>The poetical latitude given to the compositions which
describe the life and adventures of <em>Panji</em>, leaves it doubtful
whether he was in fact the real son of a Javan prince, or
some aspiring adventurer from India, whose attachment the
chief of <em>Jang'gála</em> might have found it his interest to secure.
In the dramatic exhibitions of the same subject, it is difficult
to decide whether the heroes of the piece are intended to
represent the real personages whose names appear in history,
or whether they are merely invested with historical titles, for
the purpose of giving dignity to fictitious characters.</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the reverence in which <em>Pánji</em>
is held by the Javans, from their representing him as an
incarnation of <em>Vishnu</em>, and his second wife, <em>Chándra Kirana</em>,
under the name of <em>Déwi Gélu</em>, as an incarnation of <em>Sri</em>.</p>

<p>This belief, together with the miraculous transformations
and supernatural events attributed to the interference of the
Hindu deities, while heightening the colours of these compositions
may have rendered them more popular subjects for
dramatic exhibition, but it has deprived them of nearly all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1097" id="Page_1097">[Vol II Pg 97]</a></span>
authenticity and value as historical records. Perhaps the
only inferences, with respect to the hero of them, which we
can be justified in drawing, is that the prowess, enterprises,
and accomplishments of this chieftain, who has been termed
the Charlemagne of the East, far excelled those of his cotemporaries,
and that he visited <em>Báli</em>. It appears also, that
during this period some government was established in the
other islands of the Archipelago, in which a similarity of
religion, character, and usages prevailed. As descriptive of
the manners and customs of the country, and as affording
incontestible evidence, not only of the existence of the Hindu
religion on Java, but of its universal diffusion as the prevailing
worship of these islands at this period of their history,
these traditionary remains possess a high value; and with the
traces of foreign influence still to be found in their languages,
and in the numerous monuments of the arts, will materially
contribute to the developement of their earlier history, while
they throw light on the character of the people, and the progress
that had been made in civilization.</p>

<p>The <em>kris</em> is believed to have been first introduced into the
Eastern Islands by <em>Pánji</em>; and some go so far as to assert,
that all the countries in which it is now worn acknowledged
his supremacy. The <em>gámelan</em>, or musical instruments of the
Javans, together with the various dramatic exhibitions which
still form so essential a part of the popular amusement, and
compose so distinguishing a characteristic of national literature,
are all supposed to have been introduced by him.</p>

<p>The adventures of <em>Pánji</em> are related in the Malayan
romances, where that hero is represented under the appellation
of <em>Chékel Wáning Páti</em> (literally, "when young brave
to death"), and in the Malayan annals a particular account is
given of a chief of <em>Sábrang</em>, who, according to their story,
obtained the princess <em>Chándra Kirána</em> in marriage<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1098" id="Page_1098">[Vol II Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>About this period the first intercourse with China is believed
to have taken place: a large Chinese <em>wángkang</em> was
wrecked on the north coast of Java, and the crew landed,
some near <em>Japára</em>, others at <em>Semárang</em> and <em>Tégal</em>. The
rider of the vessel is represented as bringing with him a
magical stone, by which he performed many wonderful effects,
and by means of which he ingratiated himself with the chief
of <em>Tégal</em>, who allowed him to collect the remainder of his
crew into a regular establishment, and conferred upon them
many privileges.</p>

<p>The accounts regarding the succession of <em>Pánji</em> to the
throne of his father are very discordant. In some he is
represented as having succeeded on his death, and having
continued to administer the government for several years; in
others, he is represented as dying prematurely, during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1099" id="Page_1099">[Vol II Pg 99]</a></span>lifetime of his father: <em>Prába Jáya Sangára</em>, chief of <em>Madúra</em>
(then called <em>Núsa Antára</em>, or the island lying between),
jealous of the power of <em>Jang'gála</em>, is said to have landed, and
in a desperate action killed <em>Pánji</em> with an arrow from his
own bow, in fulfilment of a prophecy which foretold that he
would be invulnerable, except to the iron staff of <em>Jáya
Langkára</em>, of which, it is added, this prince had manufactured
his arrow. The account of this affair, as related
in the <em>Madúra</em> traditions, is as follows:</p>

<p>"Then the prince of <em>Núsa Antára</em>, called <em>Klána Prábu
Jaya</em>, consulted with <em>Gúra Bramána Kánda</em>, and others of
his council, on the probability of his being acknowledged as
chief prince over the adjacent countries. <em>Gúru</em> observed,
that while <em>Déwa Kasúma</em> lived he could not permit the
attempt; but the prince informing him that intelligence had
been received of the death of that prince, then said, '<em>Gúru</em>,
it is well; you are permitted to effect your object by
force, if necessary, but in the first instance try negotiation.'
A letter written on the leaf of a tree was then
dispatched, and when the messenger arrived at <em>Jang'gála</em>,
he found the prince <em>Angráma Wijáya</em> seated on his
<em>setingel</em>, attended by his <em>patéhs</em>, <em>Kúda Nawársa</em> and <em>Brája
Náta</em>. At that time they were discussing the prince's
intention of transferring his title to his son, <em>Ino Kérta Pati</em><a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.
The question was not decided when the messenger appeared.
The prince declined reading the letter himself, but
desired his minister to do so. As soon as <em>Brája Náta</em> read
the demand of the prince of <em>Núsa Antára</em> to be acknowledged
the superior, and the threat that he would lay waste
the lands of Java in case of refusal, he became enraged to
the highest degree, and without communicating the contents
tore the letter, and seizing the messenger by the neck,
threw the pieces in his face, and desired him to return
to his master. After his departure <em>Ino Kérta Páti</em> arrived,
and being apprized of the circumstances, entreated his
father to permit him to go over in disguise to <em>Núsa Antára</em>.</p>

<p>"On the return of the messenger to <em>Núsa Antára</em>, he
reported the result of his mission, when preparations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1100" id="Page_1100">[Vol II Pg 100]</a></span>
immediately made for the attack upon <em>Jang'gála</em>, and the
chief, on this occasion, received the title of <em>Jáya Sankára</em>.
But before the troops had departed, <em>Ino Kérta Páti</em> contrived
to carry off from the palace the wife of the prince, named
<em>Dewi Sinawáti</em>, which raised the enmity of the parties to
the highest pitch.</p>

<p>"The prince of <em>Jang'gála</em>, when he was informed of these
preparations, summoned his brothers from <em>Ng'aráwan</em> and
<em>Sínga Sári</em>, who resolved to unite with him against the
expected attack. The three princes were in conversation,
when information was brought them that the hostile troops
had landed in great numbers. Then they drew out their
people, and a battle ensued with the prince of <em>Núsa
Antára</em>, who lost many chiefs and followers. This prince
finding the battle going against him, recollected the advice
of <em>Gúru Bramána Kánda</em>, the loss of his wife, and the
many insults he had received from <em>Ino Kérta Páti</em>: then
throwing off his princely attire, he disguised himself as a
common man, and arming himself with an arrow mixed
with the people of <em>Jang'gála</em>, and went in search of <em>Ino
Kérta Páti</em>. He had no sooner found him, than he discharged
his arrow, and <em>Ino Kérta Páti</em> fell dead, it having
been foretold that this chief could not be killed except by
the iron staff of <em>Jáya Langkára</em>, of which the prince of
<em>Núsa Antára</em> had made his arrow, <em>kris</em>, and knife.</p>

<p>"<em>Brája Náta</em> immediately acquainted his prince with the
fall of <em>Ino Kérta Páti</em>, who thereupon rose and rushed into
the thickest of the fight. The prince of <em>Jang'gála</em> attacked
the prince of <em>Núsa Antára</em> with his <em>kris</em>, and slew him.
<em>Gúru Bramána Kánda</em> seeing his prince slain, wished to
escape, but his supernatural power was no more; and being
seized by the prince of <em>Jang'gála</em>, he was put to death, with
all the people of <em>Núsa Antára</em>, who did not save themselves
by flight. Thereupon <em>Agráma Wijáya</em> assembled his
council as before the war, and seated upon his setingel declared,
that as <em>Ino Kérta Pati</em> was no more, it was his intention
to nominate his grandson, <em>Máisa Laléan</em>, to succeed
him. <em>Máisa Laléan</em> accordingly became chief of
<em>Jang'gála</em> in the year 927, and after a time made his uncle,
<em>Brája Náta, Tumúnggung</em> of <em>Jang'gála</em>, and retired him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1101" id="Page_1101">[Vol II Pg 101]</a></span>self
to the district of <em>Kédu</em>. He had a son, named <em>Banjáran
Sari</em>, who succeeded him, after whom were <em>Múdaníngkung</em>,
and <em>Múda Sári</em>, who had a son called <em>Ráden
Pánkas</em>, who succeeded to the government of Java in the
year 1084. This prince established his capital at <em>Pajajáran</em>."</p>

<p>The fame of <em>Pánji</em> naturally throws the other events of
the day into the back-ground, and whatever credit may be
due to the earlier administration of his successor, it is eclipsed
by the brilliancy of his exploits. But it seems agreed that
<em>Kúda</em>, or <em>Máisa Laléan</em>, who is the next prince in the line of
succession of whom tradition makes mention, at an early
period of his reign induced the separate authorities which
had been established at <em>Browérno</em>, <em>Sínga Sári</em>, and <em>Kedíri</em>,
to acknowledge the supremacy of <em>Jang'gála</em>. Having, however,
come to the throne at a tender age, and being under the
influence of a crafty and designing minister, named <em>Báka</em>,
who, with one of the brothers of the prince, entered into a
league to deprive him of his inheritance, he quitted his capital,
and on the dismemberment of his eastern kingdom, became
the founder of a new one in the west. The causes
which induced him to leave his capital are related to have
been a dreadful sickness, which at that period prevailed in
the eastern districts of Java, and the designs of his minister,
who hoped to possess the means of aggrandizing himself in
the attempt to form a new establishment. The first eruption
of the mountain <em>Klut</em>, of which tradition makes mention, is
recorded to have taken place at this time, when the discharges
from it are represented "to have been like thunder,
and the ashes to have involved the country in impenetrable
darkness." The sickness having continued to prevail after
the departure of the prince, the inhabitants who had remained
at an early period, are said to have embarked in vessels and
proceeded to sea, no one knowing whither they went or hearing
more of them.</p>

<p><em>Kúda Laléan</em>, accompanied by his mother <em>Chándra
Kirána</em>, proceeded west as far as <em>Blóra</em>, where he laid the
foundation of a new capital, under the designation of <em>Méndang
Kamúlan</em>, the name of the ancient capital of the island.
From thence, however, owing to the treachery of his minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1102" id="Page_1102">[Vol II Pg 102]</a></span>
<em>Báka</em>, who aspired to the sovereignty, he was soon obliged
to fly, and to take refuge with a devotee, until the chief of
<em>Gíling Wési</em>, named <em>Prau Chátor</em>, going to war with <em>Báka</em>,
an opportunity was afforded him of regaining his authority.
Uniting with the forces of that chief, he succeeded in overpowering
<em>Báka</em>, and laying waste his capital, which he afterwards
burnt.</p>

<p>This <em>Báka</em> is said to have had a criminal passion for his
own daughter, and in consequence of her refusing to gratify
his desires, to have secreted her in an adjoining forest. In
his service was a man named <em>Bándung Prakúsa</em>, descended
from <em>Aru Bándung</em>, of <em>Balambángan</em>, and also from <em>Káran
Kálang</em>, the last chief of <em>Brambánan</em>. This man aspired to
obtain the daughter in marriage. The father consented to
the match, on condition that he would remove the temples
from the old site to the new <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>. Having
made the usual offerings at the <em>Sáng'gar</em>, and done penance
for forty days without sleeping, in the middle of the last night,
when his <em>tápa</em> was all but accomplished, it happened that a
maiden rose in her sleep, and without awaking, began to beat
the rice block. On this, considering it daylight, he quitted
his penance, and finding the stars still bright, he called down
a curse on the women of <em>Brambánan</em>, that they should never
be married till their hair was grey. This man is then said to
have been transformed into a dog, or in other words, to have
become a wanderer as a dog in the forests, where he met with
the daughter of <em>Báka</em>. From their intercourse is born a son,
who in time destroys his father and marries his mother. From
this union the people known at this day by the term <em>Kálang</em>,
trace their descent, although it is more generally believed
that they are the real descendants of the first inhabitants of
the island.</p>

<p>The brother of <em>Kúda Laléan</em>, <em>Chítra Arung Báya</em>, also
called <em>Chamára Gáding</em>, being deceived by <em>Báka</em>, formed a
party at <em>Jung'gála</em>, and embarked from thence for the island
of Celebes, where he established himself, and is supposed to
be the same with <em>Sawíra Gáding</em>, the first prince of whom
the <em>Búgis</em> accounts make mention.</p>

<p><em>Kúda Laléan</em> having been requested by the chiefs of
<em>Bányu Mas</em>, <em>Lúrung Téng'a</em>, and <em>Tégal</em>, to render them assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1103" id="Page_1103">[Vol II Pg 103]</a></span>ance
against the Chinese, who, by their extortions and oppressions,
had thus early become troublesome to the people
of the country, attacked them, and killing their chief, relieved
the inhabitants of these districts from their oppressions.
From this period the Chinese have been dispersed over the
whole island.</p>

<p><em>Kúda Laléan</em> with his followers then proceeded westward,
as far as <em>Gíling Wési</em>, which was situated in the southern
provinces among the mountains of <em>Chidámar</em>, a district of
the modern province of <em>Sukápura</em>, and in the fabulous and
mythological accounts supposed to have been the ancient
capital of <em>Wátu Gúnung</em>. Finding two brass cannon in the
neighbourhood, he considered them as the signal for the foundation
of his new capital, and built a city and <em>kráton</em> on the
spot, to which he gave the name of <em>Pajajáran</em>, where, assuming
the sovereignty of the country, he was acknowledged
under the title of <em>Browijáya Máisa Tandráman</em>.</p>

<p>This prince was a great promoter of agriculture, and encouraged
the common people in the labours of cultivation by
his personal example. He was the first who introduced the
rice husbandry into the western provinces, and trained the
buffalo to the yoke, from which circumstance he is called
<em>Maisa</em>, and his descendants <em>Múnding</em>, both signifying a
buffalo, the former in the Javan and the latter in the <em>Súnda</em>
language. According to the tradition of the <em>Súndas</em>, the wild
buffaloes came from the woods of their own accord during the
reign of this chief.</p>

<p>This prince had two sons, the elder of whom, not contented
to remain at home, engaged in foreign commerce and went
beyond sea; and the younger succeeded his father in the
year 1112, under the title of <em>Prábu Múnding Sári</em>.</p>

<p>It was seven years before he was enabled permanently to
establish his authority; and soon after he had done so, his
elder brother returned, who having resided in India and having
become a convert to the Mahomedan faith, is known by
the title of <em>Háji Púrwa</em>. He was accompanied by an Arab
from the country of <em>Koúje</em>, who was descended from <em>Sáyed
Abás</em>, and attempted in vain to convert his brother and family
to the same faith. The troubles which were occasioned by
their intrigues, and the endeavours which they used to effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1104" id="Page_1104">[Vol II Pg 104]</a></span>
their purpose, and which are allegorically described by the
rapid growth and destructive effects of the <em>lagóndi</em> plant, were
such as led to the removal of the capital further westward.
In this new site it still retained the name of <em>Pajajáran</em>, being
situated in the district of <em>Bógor</em> and in the vicinity of the
modern <em>Buitenzorg</em>, the country residence of the European
governor of the colony.</p>

<p><em>Háji Púrwa</em> being unsuccessful in his attempts, and fearing
the rage of the common people, quitted this part of the
country, and is believed to have found an asylum in <em>Chéribon</em>,
then an uninhabited wilderness.</p>

<p>This is the first mention of the Mahomedan religion on Java.</p>

<p>The next chief of <em>Pajajáran</em> was <em>Múnding Wáng'i</em>, who
succeeded to the government about the year 1179. He had
four legitimate children; the eldest a daughter, who refusing
to be married was banished to the southern coast, where her
spirit is still invoked, under the title of <em>Ratu Kidul</em>; the second,
also a daughter, was born white and diseased, and was
in consequence sent to an island off <em>Jakatra</em> (named from this
circumstance <em>Púlu Pútri</em>), from whence she is said to have
been carried away by the white men, who according to the
Javan writers traded to the country about this period; the
third a son, named <em>Aria Babáng'a</em>, who was appointed <em>Rája</em>
of <em>Gálu</em>; and the fourth <em>Raden Tandúran</em>, who was destined
to be his successor in the government. He had also a son by
a concubine; but in consequence of the declaration of a devotee,
who had been unjustly executed by <em>Múnding Wáng'i</em>,
that his death would be avenged whenever the prince should
have a child so born, he was desirous of destroying him in his
infancy, but not being able, on account of the extreme beauty
of the child, to bring himself to kill it with his own hands, he
enclosed it in a box, and caused it to be thrown by one of his
<em>Mántris</em> into the river <em>Kráwang</em>. The box being carried down
the stream was discovered by a fisherman, who brought up the
child as his own, until he arrived at twelve years of age.
Finding him then to possess extraordinary abilities, he carried
him to <em>Pajajáran</em> for further instruction, and placed him
under the charge of his brother, who was skilled in the working
of iron and steel. To the boy he gave the name of <em>Baniák
Wédi</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1105" id="Page_1105">[Vol II Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The youth soon excelled in the manufacture of all kinds of
iron-work, and in the wild tradition of the country, he is said
to have fashioned the red hot iron with his fingers. In a short
time he was made chief of the <em>Pándi</em>, or ironsmiths, and admitted
to the familiar intercourse of his father, <em>Múnding
Wang'i</em>. Having constructed an iron chamber or cage, which
particularly attracted the attention of the prince, he succeeded
in persuading him to sleep in it, when closing the door, he,
according to some accounts, burned him alive; or, according
to others, caused him to be thrown into the South Sea at <em>Kándang
Wési</em>, thus fulfilling the prophecy of the devotee.</p>

<p><em>Baniák Wédi</em> now assumed the government, declaring who
he was; but being opposed by his brother, <em>Tandúran</em>, who
had been destined to succeed his father, it was some time before
his authority was acknowledged. At length defeating
his brother in a general engagement, the latter escaped with
only three followers, and <em>Baniák Wédi</em> was declared sovereign,
under the title of <em>Browijáya Chióng Wanára</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ráden Tandúran</em> arriving at the river <em>Gúntung</em>, took refuge
at the house of a widow, and afterwards meeting with his
sister, who was performing a penance on the mountain <em>Chérmai</em>
(the mountain of <em>Chéribon</em>), he was encouraged by her to
proceed further east, following the course of a bird which she
desired that he would let loose for the purpose, till he reached
the district of <em>Wirasába</em>. Here he observed a plant, called
the <em>mája</em>, entwined round a tree. He wished to eat of the
fruit, but finding it extremely bitter threw it away, and asked
one of his followers, <em>Kiái Wíra</em>, the reason of its bitterness.
"I have heard," replied <em>Kiái Wíra</em>, "that it was here your
forefathers fought in the war <em>Bráta Yúdha</em>." On which the
prince said, "Then let us stop here and establish our kingdom,
and let us call it <em>Majapáhit</em>" This was in the Javan
year 1221.</p>

<p>In the Javan language <em>mája</em> and <em>páhit</em> both signify "bitter;"
but the name of this kingdom, also called <em>Mauspáhit</em>, is more
probably derived from <em>Maus Páti</em>, the ancient capital of
<em>Arjúna Wijáya</em>, in whom the Javans believe <em>Vishnu</em> to have
been incarnate.</p>

<p><em>Ráden Tandúran</em> was first assisted by the people of <em>Túban</em>,
who hearing of the arrival of a prince of royal descent, imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1106" id="Page_1106">[Vol II Pg 106]</a></span>diately
flocked to his standard. Afterwards <em>Aria Babáng'a</em>,
who had been driven from <em>Gálu</em> by the forces of <em>Chióng Wanára</em>,
joined his younger brother, <em>Ráden Tandúran</em>, and was
appointed to the charge of the eastern districts along the Solo
river, under the title of <em>Aria Panúlar</em>. In a short time considerable
emigrations took place from <em>Pajajáran</em>, in consequence
of the heavy demands made upon the people. Among
others, <em>Bráma Dedáli</em> at the head of eighty <em>Pándi</em>, or ironsmiths,
with their families, are said to have deserted their
country. They were pursued as far as the river <em>Pamáli</em> in
<em>Brébes</em>, but effected their escape, and were received with open
arms at <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p><em>Chiong  Wanára</em>, on demanding that the <em>Pándi</em> should be
delivered up, received a positive refusal, and in consequence
declared war against his half-brother, whose authority by this
time extended as far as <em>Bátang</em>. Both princes, with their
respective armies, moved towards the centre of the island:
the forces of <em>Majapáhit</em> encamped at <em>Ung'árang</em>, and those
of <em>Pajajáran</em> at <em>Kaliwúngu</em>. A general engagement now
took place; which proving indecisive, a personal combat between
the two chiefs was about to occur, when it was mutually
agreed, that from thenceforth the countries to the west
should be subject to <em>Pajajáran</em>, and those to the east to <em>Majapáhit</em>,
a line being drawn due south from a stone column
placed near the spot in commemoration of the agreement.
This column is still to be seen at <em>Túgu</em>, a few miles west of
<em>Semaráng</em>. This treaty, supposed to have been made in the
Javan year 1247, does not appear to have lasted longer than
the life time of <em>Chiong  Wanára</em>; for several of the finest provinces,
and particularly those to the east of <em>Chi Pamáli</em>, had
been laid waste, and the succeeding chiefs not being able to
reduce the country to order and submission, appear to have
placed themselves under the immediate protection of <em>Majapáhit</em>.
They accordingly delivered up the gun <em>ng'ai stómi</em>,
and several of smaller calibre, which were considered as the
<em>pusáka</em> (inheritance or regalia) of <em>Pajajáran</em>, and are still
held sacred by the princes of Java. The gun <em>stómi</em> is now in
the possession of the <em>Susuhúnan</em>.</p>

<p>An ineffectual attempt was made by <em>Rátu Déwa</em>, a native
of <em>Kuníng'an</em> in <em>Chéribon</em>, who, on the departure of <em>Aria Ba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1107" id="Page_1107">[Vol II Pg 107]</a></span>-bang'a</em>,
had been entrusted with the administration of <em>Gálu</em>,
to maintain an authority independent of <em>Majapáhit</em>; but he
lost his life in the struggle, and his widow, <em>Torbíta</em>, who persevered,
and was for a time successful, was at length overcome,
and went over to <em>Majapáhit</em><a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1108" id="Page_1108">[Vol II Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>A different account of the first establishment of the <em>Majapáhit</em>
empire is given in a manuscript recently obtained from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1109" id="Page_1109">[Vol II Pg 109]</a></span><em>Báli</em>, which may deserve attention, in as far as it differs from
the usually received opinion in Java. This account is as

<p>(literally 1465.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1112" id="Page_1112">[Vol II Pg 112]</a></span></p>
<p>"In the kingdom of <em>Tumápel</em> there reigned a king, named
and styled <em>Rátu Sri Jáya Purúsa</em>, who in his demise was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1113" id="Page_1113">[Vol II Pg 113]</a></span>succeeded by his son, known by the name and title of <em>Sri
Láksi Kirána</em>, who on dying left two sons, the elder named
and styled <em>Sang Sri Síwabúda</em>, who succeeded to the
throne; the younger <em>Ráden Wijáya</em>, who was remarkable
for the beauty of his person.</p>

<p>"During the reign of <em>Sáng Srí Síwabúda</em> the state had
very much declined. Every district was going to ruin, in
consequence of which the <em>páteh</em>, named <em>Mángku Rája
Náta</em>, addressed himself to the prince, reminding him of
the manner in which his forefathers used to treat the
people, and which the welfare of his kingdom required of
him to follow. To this, however, the prince would not
listen, and as a punishment to the <em>páteh</em> for his presumption,
he immediately ordered him to quit <em>Tumápel</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Sang Sri Síwabúda</em> had a man in his service named
<em>Wíra Rája</em>, whom, in consideration of his useful services,
he had made ruler over the eastern part of <em>Madúra</em> called
<em>Súmenap</em>. On being informed that the king intended to
accuse him of a crime of which he was innocent, and considering
himself in danger, sent a messenger to <em>Sri Jáya
Kátong</em>, sovereign of <em>Kedíri</em>, to say, 'that as the kingdom
of <em>Tumápel</em> was almost in a state of confusion, he might
attack and conquer it without difficulty.'</p>

<p>"<em>Sri Jáya Kátong</em>, on hearing the intelligence, was very
much delighted, and accordingly he ordered his <em>patéh</em>,
<em>Kébo Mundárang</em>, to make preparations for the purpose of
invading <em>Tumápel</em>.</p>

<p>"When every thing was ready the king gave orders to his
<em>patéh</em> that he should march with a considerable force to
<em>Tumápel</em>, and attack the southern part of the kingdom,
while himself and his followers began the attack on the
west.</p>

<p>"<em>Sri Síwabúda</em> being informed that his kingdom was invaded
by the sovereign of <em>Kedíri</em>, appointed his younger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1114" id="Page_1114">[Vol II Pg 114]</a></span>brother, <em>Ráden Wijáya</em>, to command the forces, and meet
the enemy coming from the west. Instead of marching out
himself to meet the attack from the south he remained in
his <em>kadáton</em>, and amused himself with his concubines.
This enjoyment, however, was soon interrupted; for <em>Mundárang</em>
having reached the <em>kadáton</em> obliged him to come
out and meet him, and on his making his appearance, <em>Mundárang</em>
and his followers lost no time in deciding his fate.
<em>Sri Síwabúda</em> was accordingly killed before the palace gate.
<em>Ráden Wijáya</em> and <em>Jáya Kátong</em> had by this time fought
several battles, as well as skirmishes, in which a great
number of men were killed on both sides.</p>

<p>"They continued to oppose each other when <em>Mundárang</em>
came up and attacked <em>Wijáya</em> in the rear. This soon determined
the victory in favour of <em>Kedíri</em>, and obliged <em>Wijáya</em>
to fly to <em>Súmenap</em> for the safety of his person, where
he remained in the house of <em>Wíra Rája</em>, to whom he gave
a full account of all the circumstances.</p>

<p>"Among the spoils which <em>Mundárang</em> had taken from the
palace was the beautiful wife of <em>Wijáya</em>, who was afterwards
delivered to the sovereign of <em>Kedíri</em>. He was very
much struck with her beauty, and proposed to make her
his lawful wife.</p>

<p>"This proposal was however refused, and the king, instead
of being offended by the refusal, adopted her as his
daughter.</p>

<p>"<em>Ráden Wijáya</em> had by this time remained a good while
with <em>Wíra Rája</em> at <em>Súmenap</em>, and was then advised by him
to repair to <em>Kedíri</em>, that <em>Jáya Kátong</em> might forgive him,
and employ him in some way or other. He accordingly
went over to <em>Jáya Kátong</em>, who received him very kindly;
and he had not remained long at <em>Kedíri</em> when <em>Jáya Kátong</em>
granted him an extensive forest, with which he might do
as he liked.</p>

<p>"<em>Wijáya</em>, with a view of making a large town in the
forest, sent a messenger to <em>Wíra Rája</em> to get some assistance.
<em>Wíra Rája</em> accordingly sent over a good many
people to <em>Wijáya</em>, who, after procuring every thing necessary
for such an undertaking, began to cut down the forest.
While they were at work they found a large <em>mája</em> tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1115" id="Page_1115">[Vol II Pg 115]</a></span>
loaded with fruit, but when they tasted the fruit they found
it quite bitter; whence the place was called <em>mája páit</em>,
(literally the bitter mája.)</p>

<p>"<em>Ráden Wijáya</em>, after making <em>Majapáhit</em> a very large
town, assumed the title of <em>Bopáti Sang Browíjáyá</em>, having
for his <em>Páteh</em> a son of <em>Wíra Rája</em>, whose name and title
was <em>Kiaái Pateh Ráng'ga Láwé</em>.</p>

<p>"The population of <em>Majapáhit</em> increasing very rapidly,
<em>Browijáya</em> thought, that with the aid of <em>Wíra Rája</em> he
should be able to invade <em>Kedíri</em>. He accordingly sent a
messenger to <em>Wíra Rája</em> to request some assistance. <em>Wíra
Rája</em> willingly sent a considerable force to <em>Browíjáya</em>, and
after the two armies had joined together Browíjáya began
his march to <em>Kedíri</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Jáya Kátong</em>, on being informed that a considerable
force from <em>Majápáhit</em> was coming to invade his kingdom,
immediately sent out a band of fighting men to meet the
enemy. Several battles were fought in which many fell on
either side.</p>

<p>"<em>Jáya Kátong</em>, previous to the invasion of <em>Browijáya</em>, had
promised his guest, the King of <em>Tátar</em><a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, whose name and
title was <em>Srí Laksemána</em>, to give him his adopted daughter
(wife to <em>Browijáya</em>) in marriage. This was however delayed.
Several times did <em>Laksemána</em> press <em>Jáya Kátong</em>
to fulfil his promise, but he never received a positive
answer.</p>

<p>"<em>Laksemána</em> therefore being informed that <em>Browijáya</em> of
<em>Majápahit</em> had attacked <em>Kedíri</em>, forthwith sent a letter to
him, saying that he would co-operate with the people of
<em>Majapáhit</em>, provided <em>Browijáya</em> would be on good terms
with him.</p>

<p>"<em>Browijáya</em> on receiving this intelligence was very much
delighted, and accordingly returned a letter of approbation
to <em>Laksemána</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Láksemána</em> and his followers then joined <em>Browijáya</em>,
and fought several battles with <em>Jáya Kátong</em>, in which a
great number of men, as well as chiefs, were killed on both
sides.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1116" id="Page_1116">[Vol II Pg 116]</a></span></p>
<p>"In the heat of the action <em>Jáya Kátong</em> and <em>Laksemána</em>
met, and a fierce encounter took place between these chiefs.
<em>Jáya Kátong</em> threw his javelin at <em>Laksemána</em>, but missed
him; and <em>Laksemána</em>, in return, struck him on the breast
with his poisoned spear, and killed him on the spot.</p>

<p>"<em>Páteh Mundárang</em>, and the whole force of <em>Kedíri</em>, perceiving
that their king was fallen, immediately surrendered.</p>

<p>"<em>Browijáya</em> then eagerly went into the <em>kadáton</em>, and was
received by his faithful wife. They embraced with tears
of joy; and <em>Browijáya</em> was so enraptured at recovering
her, that without taking further notice of the <em>kadáton</em>, he
returned with his wife to <em>Majapáhit</em>. He invited the King
of <em>Tátar</em> to visit him. On his arrival <em>Browijáya</em> received
him with every attention, and made him a present of a
beautiful virgin.</p>

<p>"<em>Laksemána</em> remained for some time at <em>Majapáhit</em>,
during which <em>Browijáya</em> gave him two or three grand entertainments.
He afterwards embarked on board of his
own vessel and returned to his kingdom of <em>Tátar</em>."</p>

<p>The story concludes with stating that <em>Browijáya</em>, with his
<em>Páteh, Rang'ga Lawé</em>, reigned at <em>Majapáhit</em>, and governed
the whole of the island of Java, and his people were very
happy.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1117" id="Page_1117">[Vol II Pg 117]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1118" id="Page_1118">[Vol II Pg 118]</a></span>Under the second prince of <em>Majapáhit</em>, called <em>Brokamára</em>
or <em>Brow'yáya</em> the second, the manufacture of arms of various
descriptions was brought to the highest perfection; and the
first damasked <em>krises</em> were now made by the <em>pándi</em> (smiths)
from <em>Pajajáran</em>, who became so distinguished that they were
appointed to the charge of districts with a thousand <em>chácha</em>
each. The <em>kris</em>, which was afterwards placed on the tomb
of <em>Susúnan Gíri</em>, is said to have been manufactured at this
time from a piece of old iron found by the prince.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1119" id="Page_1119">[Vol II Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The reign of the third prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> was of very
short duration, and he was succeeded by <em>Ardi Wijaya</em>, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1120" id="Page_1120">[Vol II Pg 120]</a></span>putting to death the prime minister, eventually fell a sacrifice
to the just revenge of the minister's son.</p>

<p>This prince, however, is distinguished by the extent of his
conquests, and for the victory he obtained over <em>Sri Sin Dérga</em>,
King of <em>Sing'apura</em> on the <em>Malayan</em> peninsula, whose subjects
lived by piracy, but by this event became tributary to
<em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>To him succeeded the fifth prince of <em>Majapáhit</em>, named
<em>Mérta Wijáya</em>, whose minister, <em>Gúja Mada</em>, became celebrated
for his virtues and abilities, and for the code of regulations
which at this day exists under his name. In his reign
the conquest of <em>Indragíri</em>, or Sumatra, which had begun by
his predecessor, was successfully completed.</p>

<p>Accounts differ regarding the successor of his prince, some
considering <em>Ráden Alit</em>, his brother, to have succeeded at an
early age, and others that <em>Ráden Alit</em> is the same with <em>Angka
Wijáya</em>, the last sovereign of <em>Majapáhit</em>. According to the
latter accounts, many of the principal events reported to have
taken place in the reign of <em>Alít</em> are brought under that of
<em>Mérta Wijáya</em>.</p>

<p>One of the sovereigns of <em>Majapáhit</em>, according to the Malayan
annals, had two sons by the daughter of the Raja of
the mountain <em>Sa Guntang</em>; the eldest named <em>Ráden Ino
Mérta Wángsa</em>, and the younger <em>Ráden Mas Pamári</em>. The
eldest succeeded to the government of <em>Majapáhit</em>, the authority
of which then extended over the whole of Java, and all the
Rajas of <em>Núsa Tamára</em> (probably <em>Báli</em>) likewise paid allegiance
for half their lands. The sovereign of <em>Majapáhit</em>
heard of the extensive country of <em>Malacca</em> which did not owe
him allegiance, and sent a large fleet against it, under the
command of <em>Demáng Wirája</em>. The Javans, however, did
not succeed: they were forced to retreat to their <em>práhus</em> and
to return to <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>Through the wisdom of the minister, <em>Gája Máda</em>, who was
continued in office, and the prudent direction of <em>Alit Wijáya</em>,
the kingdom of <em>Majapáhit</em> rose to the highest pitch of wealth
and glory. Several nations on Sumatra, and among them the
people of <em>Palémbang</em>, as well as the inhabitants of the southern
states of Borneo, who had no regular government at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1121" id="Page_1121">[Vol II Pg 121]</a></span>
period, obtained from him protection against the people of
<em>Lámpung</em>, and in return acknowledged the supremacy of <em>Majapáhit</em>.
The authority of this empire now extended eastward
over <em>Balambángan</em> and <em>Báli</em>, and westward over what
was then termed the kingdom of <em>Súnda</em>, which included the
western districts of Java, part of Sumatra, and all the islands
situated in the straits. The inhabitants of the islands situated
in the straits of Sunda consisted for the most part of the dregs
of all nations, who having fled from the wars, or having been
otherwise obliged to desert their own country, had elected a
chief, under whom they committed extensive depredations by
sea and land.</p>

<p>During the reign of <em>Alit Wijáya</em>, the <em>pusáka kris</em>, named
<em>jala sémlang jándring</em>, was carried off by stealth, by emissaries
employed by <em>Ménak Dáli Púti</em>, prince of <em>Balambángan</em>;
but was recovered by the dexterity of a <em>pándi</em> (or smith) named
<em>Súpa</em>, who in reward for his services was made chief of <em>Madirángin</em>
(now called <em>Sidáyu</em>), and was the first distinguished
by the title of <em>Adipáti</em>. This chief afterwards proceeded with
a force to <em>Balambángan</em>, and an engagement took place near
the river <em>Káli Tíkus</em>: <em>Ménak Dáli Púti</em> was defeated and
put to death, and his family obliged to seek refuge with the
chief of <em>Bálí Klóngkong</em>. The enemy was pursued as far as
his capital; <em>Máchang púti</em>, and the whole coast was divided
into districts, under the sovereignty of <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>The chief of <em>Báli Klóngkong</em> sent an embassy to <em>Majapáhit</em>,
and concluded a treaty acknowledging its authority.</p>

<p>During this reign, a violent volcanic eruption took place
from one of the mountains in the western districts of <em>Balambángan</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mérta</em>, or according to others, <em>Alit Wijáya</em>, left two children,
a daughter named <em>Kanchána Wúnga</em>, and a son named
<em>Angka Wijáya</em>, who according to some accounts administered
the government jointly. The princess, however, is
better known as an independent sovereign, under the title of
<em>Prábu Kánya Kanchána Wúng'u</em>. It is related, that during
this reign the chief of <em>Balembángan</em>, named <em>Ménak Jéng'ga</em>,
made a successful attack on <em>Probolíng'go</em>, and reduced under
his authority all the countries which had been dependent on
<em>Majapáhit</em>, as far west as <em>Túban</em>, so that the capital was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1122" id="Page_1122">[Vol II Pg 122]</a></span>
nearly surrounded by enemies. In this state of affairs, <em>Ménak
Jéng'ga</em> offered terms, on condition of obtaining the hand of
the princess in marriage; but she, disgusted by the deformity
of his person, and a stench that exhaled from his body, not
only rejected his suit, but declared she would give her hand
to the man who would destroy him. <em>Dámar Wúlan</em>, the son
of a <em>tápa</em> or devotee, named <em>Udára</em>, and a descendant of <em>Aria
Babáng'a</em>, obtained a single victory over the rebels at <em>Probolíng'go</em>,
and cut off the head of <em>Ménak Jéng'ga</em>: he was rewarded
by the hand of the princess; and all the provinces
again fell under the authority of <em>Majapáhit</em>. According to
some accounts, <em>Dámar Wúlan</em> had also been successful in
repelling an invasion from <em>Kambója</em>.</p>

<p><em>Angka Wijáya</em> having by this time attained a sufficient
age, assumed the chief authority; the princess retiring with
<em>Dámar Wúlan</em>, to whom was entrusted the charge of <em>Probolíng'go</em>
with the more eastern districts, and of <em>Súmenap</em> and
<em>Sámpang</em> on <em>Madúra</em>.</p>

<p>The first attempts to introduce the Mahomedan religion in
the eastern provinces of Java, appear to have been made at
<em>Grésik</em>, about the close of the thirteenth century of the Javan
era. In the origin and rise of <em>Grésik</em>, they are thus related
by the native writers:</p>

<p>"<em>Mulána Ibrahim</em>, a celebrated <em>Pandíta</em> from Arabia,
descended from <em>Jenal Abidin</em>, and cousin to the Raja of
<em>Chérmen</em> (a country of <em>Sábrang</em>), had established himself
with other Mahomedans at <em>Désa Léran</em> in <em>Jang'gála</em>, when
the Raja of <em>Chérmen</em> arrived at Java. This prince, who
was a Mahomedan, perceiving with regret that the inhabitants
of the large and populous island of Java were still
heathens, resolved to attempt the conversion of the King of
<em>Majapáhit, Prábu Angka Wijáya</em>, and with this view to
present to him his maiden daughter in marriage. Embarking
with his daughter, and all his relatives and followers of
every description, he reached <em>Jang'gála</em> in safety, and landing
at the <em>Désa Léran</em> he immediately built a mosque there,
and in a short time succeeded in obtaining many converts.</p>

<p>"The Raja of <em>Chérmen</em> having consulted with his relations
whom he found at <em>Léran</em>, deputed his son, <em>Sídek Mahómed</em>,
to proceed to <em>Majapáhit</em>, and apprise the king of his in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1123" id="Page_1123">[Vol II Pg 123]</a></span>tended
visit. He afterwards set out himself, with all his
party, among whom were forty holy men, his relations, who
had come with him from <em>Sábrang</em>.</p>

<p>"The King of <em>Majapáhit</em> came forth, and met Raja <em>Chérmen</em>
at the confines, where they both remained under a
<em>pasang'grahan</em>, erected for their accommodation. <em>Angka
Wijáya</em> evinced the greatest respect for Raja <em>Chérmen</em>,
and treated him with every mark of hospitality.</p>

<p>"The Raja of <em>Chérmen</em> now presented to the King of <em>Majapáhit</em>
a pomegranate in a basket, in order that, by his
acceptance or rejection of it, he might ascertain whether or
not he would become a convert. The king accepted of the
present, but not without wondering how a Raja from <em>Tána
Sábrang</em> could think of presenting him with such a fruit, as
if it had been unknown on Java. His thoughts, however,
he kept to himself; but <em>Raja Chérmen</em> knew what was
working in his mind, and soon after took his leave, and returned
with his people to <em>Léran</em>. His nephew, <em>Mulána
Máhfar</em> (son of <em>Mulána Ibrahim</em>) alone remained with
<em>Angka Wijáya</em>. Some time after this, the king having contracted
a kind of giddiness in the head, opened the pomegranate;
when, instead of the usual seeds, he found it filled
with precious stones (rubies). Surprised at this, he observed
to his minister, that <em>Raja Chérmen</em> must indeed be a very
superior kind of person, and sent <em>Mulána Máhfar</em> to request
the Raja to return; but the Raja refused to do so,
and proceeded on.</p>

<p>"When <em>Raja Chérmen</em> had been four nights at <em>Léran</em>, his
people fell sick and many died. Among them there were
three out of five cousins, who had accompanied him from
<em>Sábrang</em>, named <em>Sáyed Jáfar</em>, <em>Sáyed Kásem</em>, and <em>Sáyed
Ghárt</em>, whose tombs are known by the name of <em>Kúbur
Pánjang</em><a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>. The princess also fell sick, when her father
attended upon her himself, and besought the Almighty to
spare her and restore her to health, that his intention of
giving her to the Raja of <em>Majapáhit</em> might be fulfilled: he
prayed, however, at the same time, that if it was ordained
that <em>Angka Wijáya</em> was not to be converted, her days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1124" id="Page_1124">[Vol II Pg 124]</a></span>might be shortened. The princess shortly afterwards died,
and was interred near the graves of her relations<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.</p>

<p>"The usual tribute having been paid to the memory of
the deceased, on the different days appointed for the performance
of the ceremony, and <em>Mulána Ibrahim</em> having
been appointed to look after and take care of the graves,
the <em>Raja</em> of <em>Chérmen</em>, with all his people, set out to return
home. On his way <em>Sáyed Jáfar</em> died. He was sent on
shore at <em>Madúra</em>, and his remains were interred to the west
of the village <em>Plakára</em>. <em>Sayed Rafidin</em>, the only remaining
cousin of the <em>Raja</em>, died near <em>Bovian</em>, and was buried on
that island.</p>

<p>"<em>Angka Wijáya</em>, desirous of meeting again with <em>Raja
Chérmen</em>, arrived at <em>Léran</em> three days after his departure,
and hearing of the death of the princess, observed, that he
thought the religion of <em>Rajá Chérmen</em> would have prevented
such a calamity as the premature death of the <em>pútrí</em>
(princess), that it would have enabled her to hold out against
the sickness of Java, and that he must now think meanly
of it: to which <em>Muléna</em> replied, that such ignorance was
only the consequence of worshipping <em>Déwas</em> instead of the
true God. <em>Angka Wijáya</em> became highly enraged at this
retort; but being pacified by his followers, returned to
<em>Majapáhit</em>, without taking any further notice of it. This
happened in the year 1313.</p>

<p>"<em>Múlana Ibrahim</em>, who remained in charge of the tombs
of the deceased, afterwards removed from <em>Léran</em> to <em>Grésik</em>,
which, however, had not become a separate state. Here he
died, twenty-one years after the departure of the Raja of
<em>Chérmen</em>; and here his tomb, which is known by the name
of <em>Gapúrá Wétan</em>, is still to be seen. He died on Monday,
the twelfth of <em>Rabíulawal</em>, in the Javan year 1334.</p>

<p>"It is related, that about this period there was a woman of
<em>Kamboja</em>, named <em>Niái Gédi Pináteh</em>, the wife of the <em>patéh</em>,
or minister of that country, who on account of her being a
great sorceress was banished to Java, where, on her arrival,
she went to the king of <em>Majapáhit</em> and implored protection.
The king taking pity on her, the more so as she was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1125" id="Page_1125">[Vol II Pg 125]</a></span>
woman of advanced age without any children, and had been
removed from a situation where she had once been comfortable
and happy, provided for her by making her a kind
of <em>shabándar</em> (chief of the port) at <em>Grésik</em>, where there was
already a mosque and a considerable population. <em>Niái
Gédi</em> afterwards became very religious and charitable, and
was revered for becoming the foster-mother of <em>Susúnan
Gíri</em>. Her death took place forty-five years after that of
<em>Múlana Ibrahim</em>; being a short time previous to the destruction
of <em>Majapáhit</em>, and her tomb is still to be seen at
<em>Gresík</em>."</p>

<p>To return, however, to the proceedings of the King of
<em>Majapáhit</em>, it appears that early in his reign, <em>Angka Wijáya</em>,
hearing from the merchants who resorted to Java of the
beauty and accomplishments of a princess of <em>Chámpa</em>, sent
an embassy to that country to demand her in marriage; and
on her arrival at <em>Grésik</em>, received her there in person, with
great attention and state. The princess, nevertheless, for a
long time refused to cohabit with him, on account of the great
number of his concubines, and particularly on account of the
powerful hold obtained over his affections by a Chinese of
great beauty, who had been sent to him as a present from
one of the chiefs of China, at the request of the merchants
and with the consent of the emperor, with a view to obtain
greater privileges for their trade with Java.</p>

<p>The princess is represented as the second daughter of the
Raja of <em>Chámpa</em>. Her name was <em>Dára Wáti</em>, and her eldest
sister had been married to an Arab, by whom she had a son,
named <em>Ráchmat</em>.</p>

<p>Previous, however, to this marriage, <em>Angka Wijáya</em> is
said to have had an intrigue with a woman, of whom there
are various accounts, some describing her as a witch, residing
on the mountain <em>Láwu</em>, and others as a <em>rasáksa</em>.
The fruit of this illicit connection was a son, called <em>Aria
Dámar</em>. Unknown to his father, this youth distinguished
himself at an early age, by bringing together all the wild
animals of the forest, as an amusement for the prince and
his family. In consequence of an exploit so hazardous,
he was first appointed chief of a province, and afterwards
promoted to the command of an army proceeding against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1126" id="Page_1126">[Vol II Pg 126]</a></span>
<em>Báli</em>, during a war in which the forces of <em>Majapáhit</em> suffered
great loss, but were ultimately successful<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>. The capital,
called <em>Klónkong</em>, was surprised and carried, and the chief
himself, with the whole of his family, except one sister, put
to the sword. She being very beautiful, was sent to <em>Majapáhit</em>.
The island of <em>Báli</em> became tributary to <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p><em>Aria Dámar</em>, on his return, presented the various arms
which had been taken as tokens of his success; and his conduct
being highly approved of, he was appointed <em>Adipáti</em>, or
chief, of <em>Palémbang</em> on Sumatra.</p>

<p>The discontent of the Princess of <em>Chámpa</em> still continuing,
the Prince came to the resolution of parting with his Chinese
consort, and gave her to <em>Aria Dámar</em>, on condition that he
would not cohabit with her until she was delivered of the
child, of which she was then pregnant, and that he would
afterwards rear up the child as his own. <em>Aria Dámar</em> then
accompanied by the princess, and about three hundred chosen
troops, given to him by the prince of <em>Majapáhit</em>, embarked
for <em>Palémbang</em>, where he was well received, and immediately
acknowledged as chief. He soon, however, became involved
in a war with the <em>Lámpung</em> states and the neighbouring isles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1127" id="Page_1127">[Vol II Pg 127]</a></span>
of <em>Súnda</em>, the inhabitants of which were continually committing
depredations in the territories of <em>Palémbang</em>. He
proceeded into the <em>Lámpung</em> country, but before he could
reduce it to subjection, internal commotions obliged him
to return to <em>Palémbany</em>, where the Chinese princess was
now delivered of a son, to whom he gave the name of <em>Ráden
Pátah</em>. He had afterwards a son by this princess, whom he
named <em>Ráden Húsen</em>; but observing that the people of <em>Palémbang</em>
disliked the princess, on account of her Chinese extraction,
he took from one of the first families of the place
another wife, whose son might become his successor, and
resolved to send <em>Ráden Pátah</em> and <em>Ráden Húsen</em> to <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>After <em>Aria Dámar</em> had resided about three years at <em>Palémbang,
Ráden Ráchmat</em>, son of the Arab priest, who had married
one of the daughters of the Raja of <em>Chámpa</em>, arrived
there, being the bearer of letters and presents for <em>Majapáhit</em>.
<em>Ráchmat</em> was then about twenty years of age, carefully educated,
and well instructed in the Mahomedan religion. In a
short time <em>Aria Dámar</em> felt inclined to embrace the faith, but
on account of the attachment of the people of <em>Palémbang</em> to
their ancient worship, he dared not openly profess it.
<em>Ráchmat</em> remained two months at <em>Palémbang</em>, and then proceeded
on his voyage to <em>Majapáhit</em>, touching at <em>Grésik</em> on
the way, where he visited <em>Sheik Mulána Jomadil Kóbra</em>, a
devotee who had established himself on <em>Gúnung Jáli</em>, and
who declared to him that his arrival at that particular period
had been predicted by the prophet; that the fall of paganism
was at hand, and that he was elected to preach the doctrine
of Mahomed in the eastern parts of Java, where a rich harvest
of conversion awaited his apostolic labours.</p>

<p>Arriving at <em>Grésik</em> he proceeded to <em>Majapáhit</em>, where he
was kindly received by the prince, and by his relative the
princess of <em>Chámpa</em>. <em>Angka Wijáya</em>, notwithstanding he
disapproved of his religious principles, and himself refused
to become a convert to them, conceived such an attachment
for his person and such a respect for his character, that he
assigned to him three thousand families, and formed an establishment
for him at <em>Ampel</em>, situated in the vicinity of <em>Surabáya</em>,
where he allowed him the free exercise of his religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1128" id="Page_1128">[Vol II Pg 128]</a></span>
with permission to make converts of those who were inclined.
In a short time <em>Ráchmat</em> gained the affection of all those
placed under him, and most of them were by degrees converted
to the faith, whence he acquired the title of <em>Sunan</em>,
meaning, according to some, "<em>messenger from God</em>," or he
of whom requests are made, and which title, indifferently
termed <em>Sunan</em> or <em>Susuhunan</em>, the sovereigns of Java have
since continued to assume<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>. As a further testimony of his
regard for <em>Ráchmet</em>, the prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> gave to him in
marriage the daughter of his first <em>Klíwon</em>, whose brother,
<em>Wíla Tíkta</em>, he had appointed chief of <em>Túban</em>. By this wife
<em>Ráchmat</em> had three children, a daughter and two sons, who
were afterwards appointed <em>Adipátis</em> of <em>Bónang</em> and <em>Drájat</em>,
now called <em>Lasem</em> and <em>Sedáyu</em>.</p>

<p>The next Arab missionary who arrived at <em>Grésik</em> was <em>Mulána
Ishak</em>, the father of the celebrated <em>Súnan Gíri</em>. The
circumstances attending his arrival, and the establishment of
his son, are thus related.</p>

<p>"<em>Mulána Ishak</em>, otherwise called <em>Mulána Alul Islam</em> of
<em>Pási Málaca</em>, a celebrated <em>Pandíta</em>, who had given himself
up to penance and mortification, having heard that there
was at <em>Ampel</em>, on Java, a prince who was busily employed
in propagating the Mahomedan religion, and that many
persons, through his means, had embraced the faith, went
over and assisted <em>Súnan Mákdum</em> in the work of conversion:
and having received his sanction to go to <em>Balambángan</em>,
for the purpose of teaching the Mahomedan religion,
there embarked in a <em>práhu</em>, and set out on the sacred
mission.</p>

<p>"It happened that at this time the chief of <em>Balambángan</em>
was greatly distressed on account of his daughter, who was
very sick, and whose malady would not yield to the power
of medicine. One night a voice from heaven told him, that
if he would have his daughter speedily recover he must send
her to <em>Gúnung Patukáng'an</em>, where there would be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1129" id="Page_1129">[Vol II Pg 129]</a></span>
a <em>Pandíta</em> from <em>Sábrang</em>, who would cure her, and afterwards
become her husband.</p>

<p>"A storm arising, the <em>práhu</em> in which <em>Malána Ishak</em> had
embarked was driven close to the foot of <em>Gúnung Patukáng'an</em>,
and he landed there, when the chief, having sent
his daughter to the mountain, directed that the <em>Pandíta</em>
might be conveyed thither, in order that the prophecy
might be fulfilled. <em>Malána Ishak</em> first objected to undertake
the cure, on the plea that he was not skilled in medicine,
but at last agreed to comply, on condition that the
chief would embrace the Mahomedan religion if he were
successful. To this the latter consented, on which <em>Ishak</em>,
addressing the priest, said, 'I am not a person skilled in
medicine, neither do I know how to administer it, but if
your daughter would be well she has now only to wish
herself so.' The princess immediately recovered.</p>

<p>"The prince afterwards bestowed upon the <em>Pandíta</em> his
daughter in marriage, and she soon acquired a thorough
knowledge of the tenets of Mahomedanism.</p>

<p>"On one occasion, when the prince was sitting in the hall
of audience before all his people, the <em>Pandíta</em> went up to
him and reminded him of his promise to become a Mahomedan,
adding, that he was ready to instruct him in the
doctrine of that system. On this the prince became angry,
and told him in haughty terms that he never would change
his religion. No sooner had he spoken than his mouth was
distorted. At this, however, he only became the more exasperated,
and approaching the <em>Pandíta</em>, was going to
strike him, when his legs gave way under him and he fell
to the ground.</p>

<p>"The <em>Pandíta</em>, returning to his wife, took leave of her,
exhorting her to adhere to the religion he had taught her,
and telling her that he must now proceed upon the mission
on which he had originally embarked. Though desirous of
accompanying him he would not permit her. After he was
gone the land was afflicted with a pestilence, which carried
off great numbers of the people.</p>

<p>"The prince, greatly vexed, and enraged at the havock
thus made among his subjects, told his minister that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1130" id="Page_1130">[Vol II Pg 130]</a></span>
must be in consequence of his daughter being pregnant by
the <em>Pandíta</em>; and that, as soon as the child should be born
he was determined to make away with it.</p>

<p>"The Almighty, however, took the child under his especial
protection, and it was safely conveyed to <em>Grésik</em> in a trading
vessel, where it was brought up by <em>Niái Géde Pináteh</em>,
until it was twelve years of age; when, turning out a promising
boy, she resigned him to <em>Ráden Ráchmat</em>, then
called <em>Súnan Ampel</em>, for the purpose of his receiving religious
instruction. The <em>Súnan</em> soon discovered the boy was of
Arab descent, and gave him the name of <em>Ráden Páku</em>, observing,
that he would one day become the <em>pepaku</em> (that is,
the <em>support-nail</em>, or axle) of Java; he subsequently gave
him his daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>"<em>Ráden Páku</em> afterwards, accompanied by <em>Mákdum Ibrahim</em>,
son of the <em>Súnan</em>, proceeded on a pilgrimage to
<em>Mecca</em>; but touching at <em>Pási Malácca</em>, they were there presented
to the great and holy teacher, <em>Mulána Alúl Islam</em>,
who persuaded them, instead of prosecuting their voyage, to
return to their own country, in order to make converts and
become great and glorious; and giving to each of them
an Arab turban and a long gown, at the same time conferred
upon them the names of <em>Prábu Suswáta</em> and <em>Prábu Anyak
Kraswáti</em>. He moreover told them, on their return to
<em>Grésik</em>, to erect a mosque at <em>Gíri</em>.</p>

<p>"On reaching <em>Ampel</em>, after their return to Java, the <em>Súnan</em>
informed <em>Ráden Páku</em> that the holy man to whom he had
been presented at <em>Pási Malácca</em> was his own father, and
that by obeying his instructions in building a mosque at
<em>Gíri</em> he would fulfil a prophecy, and he and his companion
become great princes in Java.</p>

<p>"<em>Ráden Páku</em> then went to <em>Gíri</em>, and having cleared a
spot, a mosque and dwelling were soon erected. Numerous
proselytes being attracted thither, he was called <em>Prábu
Satmáta</em>, and sometimes <em>Susúnan Rátu Ainul Yákin</em>, but
more commonly <em>Súnan Gíri</em>. He was afterwards appointed
by the king of <em>Majapáhit</em> to be chief of the province of
<em>Grésik</em>, in the same manner as <em>Susúnan Ampel</em> had been
previously appointed. He was born A. J. 1355. <em>Prábu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1131" id="Page_1131">[Vol II Pg 131]</a></span>
Anyák Kraswáti</em>, his companion, afterwards assumed the
title <em>Susúnan Bónang</em>, under which name he was a distinguished
character in subsequent transactions."</p>

<p>In the western provinces the work of conversion was also
advancing, under the influence of <em>Sheik Ibn' Mulána</em>, who in
A. J. 1334 had established himself in <em>Chéribon</em>, where he is
better known as <em>Susúnan Gúnung Játi</em>, a name given him on
account of his fixing his abode on the hills so named. A
woman afflicted with the leprosy (a complaint which has been
declared incurable) was recovered by him, and thus procured
for him the character of being able to perform miracles. The
number of people who in consequence of the cure resorted to
<em>Gúnung Játi</em> was so great, that the chiefs, in the first instance,
thought themselves bound to interfere, and did so with the
hopes of success; but finding afterwards that they could not
resist the tide, many of them, among whom were the chiefs of
<em>Gálu</em>, <em>Sukapúra</em>, and <em>Limbangan</em>, became themselves converts
to the faith.</p>

<p>When <em>Lémbu Pétang</em>, son of <em>Angka Wijáya</em>, by the
Princess of <em>Chámpa</em>, was appointed to the charge of the
island of <em>Madúra</em>, under the title of <em>Panambáhan</em>, the <em>Súnan
Gíri</em> deputed <em>Sheik Sárif</em>, commonly called <em>Kalipha Kúsen</em>,
to accompany him, in order to make converts on that island.
This missionary was buried at <em>Aros Báya</em>, where he had
built a mosque, and is generally known on <em>Madúra</em> by the
name of <em>Pangéran Sárif</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime the name of <em>Majapáhit</em> stood high among
surrounding nations; and at no time was the authority of that
state more extensively acknowledged. Some disturbances,
however, had taken place on <em>Báli</em>, promoted by chiefs of districts,
who oppressed their subjects, and interfered with the
authority of each other. These commotions were so exasperated
by the difficulties which arose in collecting the tribute,
that the prince was obliged to send an army thither, under
the command of <em>Adáya Níngrat</em>, the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Pájang
Peng'ging</em>, who soon restored order and tranquillity. In
return for this and other eminent services he obtained in marriage
<em>Rátu Tímpo</em>, the legitimate daughter of <em>Angka Wijáya</em>.
<em>Déwa Agung Kátut</em>, a natural son of the prince by the
princess of <em>Báli</em>, being then appointed chief of that island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1132" id="Page_1132">[Vol II Pg 132]</a></span>
proceeded thither with a select force, and continued tributary
to <em>Majapáhit</em> until its downfall.</p>

<p>[The following account is given of the further success of
the <em>Majapáhit</em> arms in the Eastern Seas, under <em>Andáya Níngrat</em>,
commonly known by the title of <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em>, and
of the motives which induced the Prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> first
to give him his daughter in marriage, and afterwards to admit
him to a share in the government.]</p>

<p>"Every time that the Prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> received accounts
of the success of <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em> his alarm and uneasiness
increased; for in these accounts it was stated that
he wanted no further assistance, as he met with but little
opposition, all the rajas of <em>Sábrang</em> submitting to him,
among whom were those of <em>Makásar</em>, <em>Góa</em>, <em>Bánda</em>, <em>Sembáwa</em>,
<em>Endé</em>, <em>Tímor</em>, <em>Ternáté</em>, <em>Súlu</em>, <em>Síram</em>, <em>Maníla</em>, and
<em>Búrni</em>, in short, he and his followers conquered wherever
he went, being themselves invulnerable.</p>

<p>"At length the Prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> recollected that <em>Palémbang</em>
had not yet submitted, and in consequence sent a
handsome present to <em>Ratu Péng'ging</em>, accompanied by a
request to subdue <em>Palémbang</em> without delay.</p>

<p>"The Prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> then calling his minister, <em>Gaja
Máda</em>, inquired of him how it was that <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em>
met with such success, and was becoming so great, that no
country could withstand him, and told him, that his alarm
was excited even for his own safety, least on his return to
<em>Péng'ging</em> the island of Java should become subject to two
chiefs. To which <em>Gaja Máda</em> replied, 'he knew not how
to account for it, or to remove the uneasiness of the prince,
but that he was always ready to obey the orders of his
prince: in the present case <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em> had been
thrown into the greatest danger possible, and yet his life
was preserved; what more could be done?' The prince
then said, 'let us both perform penance, and inquire of the
Deity how to remove this uneasiness.' <em>Gaja Máda</em> assenting
to this proposal, they both kept themselves apart from
the people of the court, and fasted for forty days and forty
nights, at the expiration of which <em>Batára Naráda</em> appeared
to <em>Gaja Máda</em>, saying, 'it is impossible for you to destroy
or kill <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em>, for he is a good man, and favoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1133" id="Page_1133">[Vol II Pg 133]</a></span>
by the gods; but if the Prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> wishes to
get rid of his uneasiness, he had better make him his son-in-law,
by giving him his eldest daughter, <em>Rátu Pambáyun</em>,
in marriage.'</p>

<p>"The prince on hearing this became much astonished,
adding, that he had received a similar communication from
<em>Sang'yang Túng'gal</em> (the great and only one,) and it was
agreed to send for <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em> without delay.</p>

<p>"In a short time <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em> reached <em>Majapáhit</em>, with
numerous princes in his suite, in proof of what he had
written, that all the rajas of <em>Sábrang</em> had submitted, and
were willing to obey the will of <em>Majapáhit</em>. <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em>
then informed the prince, that in the conquest of <em>Palémbang</em>
the raja of that country had been killed, and that
he had himself appointed a person to administer the government
provisionally, until the Prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> should
nominate a new raja.</p>

<p>"The prince received him with great distinction, saying,
he knew not how to reward such eminent service, and offering
to him his daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>"After the marriage had taken place the prince assembled
all his chiefs, and placing <em>Rátu Péng'ging</em>, now his son-in-law,
on the <em>setíngel</em>, appointed him in their presence, under
the title of <em>Prábu Anom</em>, to a joint administration of the
country with himself.</p>

<p>"The prince, however, some time after, became jealous of
the authority of this chief, and removed him to <em>Péng'ging</em>,
afterwards called <em>Pájang</em>.</p>

<p>"During the administration of <em>Lémbu Pétang</em> on <em>Madúra</em>,
<em>Súmanap</em> with the subordinate islands became a separate
province under <em>Járan Panúlan</em>, a native of <em>Pamakásan</em>,
who, by his skill and courage, had raised himself to the
rank of commander of the <em>Majapáhit</em> cavalry, and was
married to an illegitimate daughter of the prince.</p>

<p>"About the year 1360 ambassadors arrived from <em>Pánjar
Másin</em>, when the prince sent one of his sons, <em>Kúda Banjáran
Sâri</em>, also called <em>Chákra Nagára</em>, to be the chief of
that country. He proceeded with many vessels, and numerous
followers and troops.</p>

<p>"The prince afterwards gave one of his daughters, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1134" id="Page_1134">[Vol II Pg 134]</a></span>
sister of <em>Chákra Nagára</em>, in marriage to a celebrated commander,
named <em>Járan Línau</em>, who was appointed <em>Adipáti</em>
of <em>Lokáno</em>, and appointed <em>Pánji Diwírio</em> chief of <em>Pranarága</em>,
with the title of <em>Batára Kátong</em>.</p>

<p>"The prince falling ill of a complaint, declared by the
physicians to be incurable, was advised, as the only means
of recovery, to cohabit with one of his female slaves, a
woolly-haired girl. The fruit of this intercourse was a son,
who, on account of his birth, was called <em>Búndan Kajáwan</em>.
This child, shortly after its birth, was delivered over to
<em>Kiái Géde Tárup Siséla</em>, chief of the prince's <em>sáwa</em>, or rice
lands, with directions to bring it up as a foundling."</p>

<p>Returning, however, to the progress of Mahomedan conversion,
which is now more rapidly advancing, the history goes
on to state that the sons of <em>Aria Dámar</em>, of <em>Palémbang</em>, who
were destined to take a most conspicuous part in succeeding
events, came to <em>Grésik</em>, the former at the age of twenty, and the
latter of eighteen. <em>Ráden Pátah</em>, aware of his extraction, and
of the treatment which his mother had received, would not proceed
to <em>Majapáhit</em>, but remained with the <em>Susúnan</em> at <em>Ampel</em>
for some time. <em>Húsen</em>, however, went to <em>Majapáhit</em>, with
injunctions not to say any thing of <em>Ráden Pátah</em>. He was
well received there, and soon after was appointed to the command
of the troops, and to administer the district of <em>Trong</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ráden Pátah</em> afterwards marrying the grand-daughter of
<em>Súnan Ampel</em>, and leaving her during her pregnancy, proceeded
to the westward, in order to form an establishment,
which he was directed to fix at a place where he should find
the sweet-scented grass, called <em>bíntara</em>. This he discovered
in a place where there were but few dry spots to be found, in
an extensive swamp, termed in Javan <em>Demalákan</em>, whence the
contraction <em>Demák</em>, first called <em>Bintára</em>.</p>

<p>As soon as the prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> heard of this new establishment
at <em>Bintára</em>, he directed <em>Húsen</em> to proceed thither
and destroy it, unless the chief was willing to acknowledge
the authority of <em>Majapáhit</em>. <em>Húsen</em> in consequence prevailed
on <em>Ráden Pátah</em> to accompany him to <em>Majapáhit</em>, where he
was recognised by his likeness to the prince, and permitted to
return to <em>Bintára</em> with the title of <em>Adipáti</em>.</p>

<p>When <em>Ráden Pátah</em> quitted <em>Majapáhit</em>, instead of return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1135" id="Page_1135">[Vol II Pg 135]</a></span>ing
to <em>Bintára</em> he went to <em>Ampel</em>, and communicated to him
the shame and rage which he felt on the discovery of his birth
and a determination which he had made to destroy <em>Majapáhit</em>.
The <em>Súnan</em>, however, moderated his anger, by telling
him that while the prince was just and beloved, and he himself
received such benefits from him, his religion did not admit
of his making war against him, or in any way injuring him.</p>

<p><em>Ráden Pátah</em> then returned to <em>Bintára</em>, taking with him
his wife, but leaving with the <em>Súnan</em> his son, <em>Ráden Abdala</em>.
<em>Bintára</em> now rose in consequence and prosperity, proselytes
became numerous, and the population daily increased.</p>

<p>Shortly after the mosque had been commenced, intelligence
was received of the severe illness of the <em>Súnan Ampel</em>, in
consequence of which <em>Ráden Pátah</em>, together with all the
chiefs and people who had embraced Mahomedanism, proceeded
to <em>Ampel</em>, where, after they had attended him for a
few days, he died, previously delivering into the hands of the
<em>Súnan Gíri</em> a <em>pusáka kris</em>, which had been given to him by
the prince of <em>Majapáhit</em>, and which he required of him never
to transfer into unhallowed hands.</p>

<p>The prince of <em>Majapáhit</em> is represented as paying every
honour to the deceased, and as having provided the usual
feast on the occasion. After this event, <em>Ráden Pátah</em> returned
to <em>Bintára</em>, whither eight missionaries, who had assumed the
title of <em>Súnan</em>, viz. <em>Súnan Bónang</em> of <em>Túban</em> (son of <em>Súnan
Ampel</em>), <em>Súnan Undang</em> of <em>Kúdus</em>, <em>Súnan Gíri</em> of <em>Grésik</em>,
<em>Súnan Agum</em> (<em>Mulána Jomadil Kobra</em> of <em>Chéribon</em>), <em>Sunan
Káli Jenar</em>, <em>Sunan Káli Jága</em>, <em>Súnan Tanggung</em> (of <em>Tegal</em>),
and <em>Súnan Drája</em> of <em>Sidayu</em>, now proceeded to assist in the
completion of the mosque. This mosque is still standing,
and is of a shape different from those constructed at a later
period, having, as it is asserted, eight pillars, to commemorate
the circumstance of the eight religious men engaged in
its construction. This event occurred in the year 1390.</p>

<p>It was now that <em>Ráden Pátah</em>, finding advisers who were
perhaps less scrupulous than the revered <em>Súnan Ampel</em>, gave
vent to his deep-rooted animosity against his father, and
formed a league with the assembled missionaries to make war
upon the pagan empire of <em>Majapáhit</em>. In consequence of
this confederacy, which was joined by all those who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1136" id="Page_1136">[Vol II Pg 136]</a></span>
embraced the Mahomedan faith, with the exception of <em>Húsen</em>
and his followers, who remained true to the prince, a numerous
army was soon collected at <em>Demák</em>, where <em>Ráden Pátah</em>
openly declared war.</p>

<p><em>Súnan Undang</em> of <em>Kúdus</em> was appointed to the chief command,
and under him the Mahomedan army marched towards
<em>Majapáhit</em>; but owing to the dexterity of <em>Húsen</em>, who commanded
the <em>Majapáhit</em> forces, a general engagement was
avoided, and for four years the hostile army was kept at bay.
The troops of <em>Majapáhit</em> at last dissatisfied with this uncertain
state of affairs and constant harassing, called loudly for
action, and in compliance with their wishes a decisive battle
was fought near the <em>Sidayu</em> river, in which the Mahomedans
were completely routed, and their chief, <em>Súnan Undang</em>,
killed. <em>Húsen</em> is accused of not having followed up this
victory to the utmost of his power, on account of his fraternal
affection for <em>Ráden Pátah</em>. The remains of <em>Súnan Undang</em>
were interred in the north side of the temple at <em>Demák</em>.</p>

<p>The prince of <em>Majapáhit</em>, after this success, again endeavoured
to reduce <em>Ráden Pátah</em> to obedience by amicable
means, and for that purpose invited him to <em>Majapáhit</em>. <em>Pátah</em>
promised to comply as soon as he should recover from a
distemper which then confined him. By this, and other excuses,
which were only urged to gain time, he contrived to
deceive the prince; and <em>Bintára</em>, with the other provinces,
continuing to pay the usual tribute, his vengeance was disarmed.</p>

<p>Considerable depredations were now made by the <em>Súnda</em>
people, who landing on the north coast proceeded by the
river <em>Losári</em> into the interior of the country, as far as <em>Bányumas</em>
and <em>Dáyu Lúhur</em>, which probably attracted the attention
of <em>Angka Wijáya</em>, more than the immediate danger which
threatened his empire from the members of his own family.</p>

<p><em>Ráden Pátah</em>, in the meantime, was very active in making
preparations for a fresh attack, and sent to <em>Palémbang</em>, for
the double purpose of asking assistance from that state and of
reconciling <em>Aria Dámar</em> to the part which he was now taking
against <em>Húsen</em>.</p>

<p>To the latter part of the message <em>Aria Dámar</em> replied, "that
it was the will of God to extirpate paganism, and to esta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1137" id="Page_1137">[Vol II Pg 137]</a></span>blish
the doctrine of Mahomed; that therefore, if <em>Húsen</em>,
who was a Mahomedan, still continued to assist the infidels,
he must abide by the consequences, and that he, as
his father, would in such case take no vengeance for the
death of his son, should it ensue."</p>

<p>The confederates gaining courage from this support, the
several chiefs sent numerous troops to <em>Demák</em>, and a second
army was soon assembled. The overthrow of the ancient
kingdom, if we are to believe the Javans, was not to be effected
by human means alone, and supernatural expedients were resorted
to. <em>Aria Dámar</em> is said to have sent to <em>Ráden Pátah</em>
the box which had been given him by his mother before he
quitted Java, directing him to carry it to the wars. <em>Súnan
Gúnung Játi</em> sent him a <em>báju ránté</em>, or chain jacket, with an
injunction not to open it until the engagement was at its
height, when thousands of rats would issue from it, and assist
in putting an end to the struggle. <em>Súnan Gíri</em> contributed
with the same instructions the sacred <em>kris</em>, from which a
swarm of hornets was to issue; and <em>Súnan Bónang</em> sent a
magical wand or cane, which in cases of extremity possessed
the power of producing allies and warriors on all sides.</p>

<p>Thus provided, the Mahomedan army took the field under
<em>Pangéran Kúdus</em>, son of the deceased <em>Súnan</em>. The progress
of the confederates is thus described.</p>

<p>"The army of the faithful, highly elated and determined
upon the downfall of paganism, were met by the united
forces of <em>Majapáhit</em>, under <em>Húsen</em>, and a severe and desperate
battle took place, which lasted for seven successive
days. In this protracted engagement the former were at
first worsted; but the commander, <em>Pangéran Kúdus</em>, availing
himself of the enchanted box and miraculous weapons,
at last succeeded in driving the enemy before him, and the
city of <em>Majapáhit</em>, surrounded on all sides, submitted to
the hostile forces, the prince and his immediate followers
having previously quitted it in disorder and fled to the eastward."</p>

<p>Thus in the year 1400 fell the great capital of Java, the
boast and pride of the Eastern Islands: thus did the sacred
city of <em>Majapáhit</em>, so long celebrated for the splendour of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1138" id="Page_1138">[Vol II Pg 138]</a></span>
court and the glory of its arms, become a wilderness. "Lost
and gone is the pride of the land."</p>

<p>The main force of the allies remained at <em>Majapáhit</em>; but
<em>Pangéran Kúdus</em> proceeded to <em>Trong</em>, whither <em>Húsen</em> had
retreated, raising combatants, by means of the magical wand
of <em>Súnan Bónang</em>, as he advanced. Here he attacked <em>Húsen</em>,
who had entrenched himself in a strong position, and soon
carried his lines. That chief immediately acknowledging his
defeat, entered into terms, and accompanied the <em>Pangéran</em> to
<em>Demák</em>, taking with him his principal followers and daughter,
whom <em>Ráden Pátah</em> was allowed to dispose of. He was well
received, and his daughter given in marriage to <em>Pangéran Aria</em>
of <em>Túban</em>.</p>

<p>On their way <em>Pangéran Kúdus</em> and <em>Húsen</em> went to <em>Majapáhit</em>,
whence the regalia had already been removed to <em>Demák</em>,
and assisted in the further removal of all property,
public and private, of every description: so that in the course
of two years the country was entirely laid waste, 1402.</p>

<p>Nothing certain is known of the fate of the prince of <em>Majapáhit</em>.
According to some accounts, he, his family, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1140" id="Page_1140">[Vol II Pg 140]</a></span>immediate adherents were put to death on the assault of the
city; according to others, he fled to <em>Málang</em>, and ultimately
to <em>Báli</em>. But the temporary establishment formed at <em>Málang</em>,
after the fall of <em>Majapáhit</em>, is ascribed by the tradition
of that district, not to the sovereign, but only to the <em>Adipáti</em>
of <em>Majapáhit</em>, probably one of the sons of <em>Angka Wijáya</em>,
who had remained with his father, and was indifferently
termed <em>Depáti Gúgur</em> or <em>Depáti Majapáhit</em>. The date at
which <em>Angka Wijáya</em> ascended the throne scarcely allows us
to believe that he was living at the period of its final overthrow.
This date may be determined from the inscriptions
on several tombs still in a state of preservation. The year
marked on the tomb of the princess of <em>Chámpa</em> (which is
within the ruins of <em>Majapáhit</em>) is 1320; that on the tomb of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1141" id="Page_1141">[Vol II Pg 141]</a></span><em>Mulána Ibrahim</em>, who died twenty-one years after the arrival
of the <em>Raja Chérmen</em> in 1313, is 1334; and as the princess
of <em>Chámpa</em> must have been living at the period of <em>Aria Dámar's</em>
being sent to <em>Palémbang</em>, when that prince had at least
attained the age of puberty, the accession of <em>Angka Wijáya</em>
to the throne of <em>Majapáhit</em> must have been anterior to the
year 1320, and a reign of eighty years more than exceeds the
limits of probability. All the accounts which are given of
the fate of this prince and his family agree in stating that the
princess of <em>Chámpa</em>, who must, if living, have been nearly a
hundred years of age, fell into the hands of the conquerors,
and found an asylum with the <em>Súnan Bónang</em> of <em>Túban</em>: but
this statement is disproved by the recent discovery at <em>Majapáhit</em>
of the tomb of this princess, who appears to have been
buried according to the Mahomedan custom, and on whose
tomb-stone the date 1320 is found, in the old Javan characters,
in the highest state of preservation.</p>

<p>In those accounts which represent the prince as having retreated
from <em>Majapáhit</em> the following particulars are related.</p>

<p>"About twelve months after the establishment of the supreme
authority at <em>Bintára</em>, or <em>Demák</em>, the people of the
more eastern provinces again reverted to the standard of
<em>Browijáya</em>, who had received assistance from his son established
on <em>Báli</em>; upon which <em>Pangéran Aria</em> of <em>Kúdus</em> and
<em>Húsen</em> were directed to proceed against them with a powerful
army. A desperate engagement took place near <em>Málang</em>,
in which the <em>Pepáti Sindu Rája</em> was killed. The
Mahomedan forces were however victorious, and following
up their success, they pursued the <em>Majapáhit</em> people to
<em>Grojógan</em> (<em>Balambángan</em>) whence <em>Browijáya</em> and those
of his followers who still adhered to his fortune took refuge
in boats, and fled to <em>Báli</em>. This event happened in the
Javan year 1403."</p>

<p>The following, however, is the traditionary account given
by the people of <em>Málang</em>, of the party who retreated thither
from <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>"When the people of <em>Majapáhit</em> were defeated, and
obliged to fly their capital, the <em>Páteh</em> of <em>Majapáhit</em> took
refuge at a place now called <em>Sing'gára</em>, to the south-west
of <em>Málang</em>, where he met with protection from a devotee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1142" id="Page_1142">[Vol II Pg 142]</a></span>
named <em>Kiái Gédé Seng'gára</em>, who becoming attached to
him gave him his daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>"After the death of the <em>Pátah</em> of <em>Majapáhit</em>, and of <em>Kiái
Gédé Seng'gára</em>, the son of the former disagreeing with his
wife, quitted <em>Seng'gára</em>, and built a small village at <em>Gedádang</em>,
where afterwards he constructed a fort, and assumed
the name of <em>Ráng'ga Permána</em>.</p>

<p>"In a short time this new country was known by the name
of <em>Súpit úrang</em>: its inhabitants commenced the manufacture
of bricks, of which the walls of the town and ramparts were
completed; they then dug a moat or ditch round the whole,
and rendered it a place of great strength.</p>

<p>"The fame of this new establishment had no sooner reached
the ears of the Mahomedan chief of <em>Demák</em>, who had now
assumed all the authority formerly possessed by <em>Majapáhit</em>,
than he sent his forces against it. The people of
<em>Súpit úrang</em> remaining however within their fortification,
the besiegers continued a long time before the place without
being able to make any impression upon it, and were about
to retire, when it occurred to them that a stratagem might
be successful. This was to catch ten doves or pigeons,
which in the course of the day might come from without
the fortification in search of food, and, after fastening to
their tails lighted brands, to let them loose into the city.
The project succeeded, for the birds, flying towards their
homes, set fire to the buildings within <em>Súpit úrang</em>, (which
were constructed of light materials,) and all was confusion.
The conflagration becoming general alarmed the people,
who fled in every direction; the prince proceeded eastward
as far as <em>Gúnung Buréng</em> (a rising ground within sight of
the town,) where he is supposed to have perished, as nothing
was afterwards heard of him. The besiegers then
took possession of the place, which since that period has
been called <em>Kóta Bedak</em> (the deserted fort.)"</p>

<p>All the chiefs and priests went to <em>Gíri</em> on their return from
<em>Seng'gára</em>, to offer up thanks for their victory. The <em>Súnan</em>
was much indisposed when they arrived, and soon after died,
at the age of sixty-three years. The tomb of the <em>Súnan Gíri</em>
is still kept in a state of preservation, and highly revered. It
is remarkable for still containing the <em>pusáka kris</em>, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1143" id="Page_1143">[Vol II Pg 143]</a></span>
desired should be placed near his grave, and to which superstition
has attached many virtues<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.</p>

<p>To return, however, to <em>Ráden Pátah</em>. No sooner had this
chief caused the removal of the regalia from <em>Majapáhit</em> to
<em>Demák</em>, than the <em>Súnans</em>, <em>Gírí</em>, <em>Bónang</em>, and <em>Káli Jága</em> formally
invested him with the government, under the title of
<em>Panambáhan Jímbun</em>, and declared him the deliverer from
paganism and the head of the faithful. The manner in which
<em>Ráden Pátah</em> obtained the sovereignty is otherwise related
in other accounts.</p>

<p>While these events were passing in the eastern and more
populous districts of Java, the missionaries were not idle in
the western districts. <em>Sheik Mulána</em>, of <em>Chéribon</em>, after effecting
the conversion of the chiefs and people in his neighbourhood,
sent his son, <em>Mulána Hásen-u-din</em>, to Bantam,
where, in the vicinity of the mountain <em>Pulasári</em>, a body of
eight hundred recluses at once embraced the faith, and his
disciples soon became numerous.</p>

<p><em>Hásen-u-din</em> went afterwards with his father to Mecca.
On their return they visited the court of <em>Menangkábau</em> on
Sumatra, where they were received with great distinction by
the Raja, who at their departure presented the father with a
celebrated <em>kris</em>. From <em>Menangkábau</em> they proceeded to the
mountain <em>Pulusári</em> in Bantam, whence the father returned to
<em>Chéribon</em>, leaving the <em>Menangkábau kris</em> with his son.
<em>Hásen-u-din</em> shortly after went to <em>Chéribon</em>, to be married to
a daughter of the <em>Súnan Demák (Ráden Pátah)</em>, and from
thence to <em>Demák</em>, where he found <em>Ráden Pátah</em> engaged in
war with the prince of <em>Majapáhit</em>. He there obtained his
daughter in marriage, and assisted in bringing the war to a
favourable conclusion, after which he returned with his wife
to Bantam. Bantam at this period was a province dependent
on <em>Pajajáran</em>.</p>

<p>About twelve months after his return to Bantam, where he
assumed the chief authority, <em>Hásen-u-din</em> went over to the
<em>Lampung</em> country in Sumatra, accompanied by <em>Pangéran
Bálu</em>, a chief of <em>Tulangbáwang</em>, and proceeded as far as <em>Indrapúra</em>,
where he married the daughter of the Raja as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1144" id="Page_1144">[Vol II Pg 144]</a></span>
second wife. On this occasion it is said that the Bencoolen
river was fixed upon as the boundary of his possessions in
that direction; but it does not appear whether, by this new
boundary, his possessions became more extended or more
circumscribed than before.</p>

<p>During the whole of his progress from <em>Tulangbáwang</em> to
<em>Indrapúra</em>, it is said that the sword was never out of the
scabbard. It is therefore probable, that his title to these
more distant regions was founded upon some previous claim,
and either that the <em>Lampung</em> country was transferred to his
father, <em>Sheik Mulána</em>, along with the <em>Menangkábau kris</em><a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>,
or that Palembang and the southern part of Sumatra might
have devolved to Bantam, in consequence of <em>Hásen-u-din's</em>
marriage with the daughter of <em>Ráden Pátah</em>, who had then
assumed the sovereignty of Java and its dependencies.</p>

<p>On <em>Hásen-u-din's</em> return from <em>Indrapúra</em>, he assembled a
large body of men, principally from the southern districts of
Sumatra, and marched against <em>Pákuan Pajajáran</em>, the chief
of which, with his followers, still adhered to the ancient faith,
and attacking that capital at midnight completely annihilated
its authority. On this occasion <em>Kráwang</em> is said to have
been fixed as the boundary between the possessions of <em>Sheik
Mulána</em> of <em>Chéribon</em> and those of Bantam, there being at that
time no intermediate power.</p>

<p>The manner in which this ancient capital was annihilated,
is described with great minuteness in the different traditions
of the <em>Súnda</em> people, and the descendants of those who escaped
and continued to adhere to their ancient faith, are to be traced
in the districts of Bantam, where they still continue distinguished
from the rest of the population under the designation
of <em>Bedui</em><a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1145" id="Page_1145">[Vol II Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the articles removed from <em>Majapáhit</em>, and still preserved
with superstitious veneration, was the <em>paséban</em>, or hall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1146" id="Page_1146">[Vol II Pg 146]</a></span>of audience, a large building, supported by a double row of
lofty pillars. This was placed in front of the mosque at <em>Demák</em>,
where it is still to be seen. At <em>Kúdus</em> there is a carved
door belonging to the place of worship which <em>Browijáya</em> used
to attend; and in the burial places at <em>Túban</em>, and several of the
eastern districts, are still to be found relics of a similar kind,
which are reverenced as sacred.</p>

<p>On the destruction of <em>Majapáhit</em>, the numerous <em>pándi</em>, or
workers in iron and steel, who were considered the strength
of the empire, and who in consequence enjoyed many privileges,
were dispersed over the eastern districts of Java, Madúra,
and Báli, forming separate establishments under their
respective chiefs. At this period the custom of wearing the
<em>kris</em> is said to have been introduced among the common
people.</p>

and draw omens from their flight, and the sounds which they utter.
One of the principal of these is a species of white-headed kite, which preys
on fish, snakes, and vermin. Before the <em>Dáyas</em> enter on a journey or
engage in any war, head-hunting, or indeed any matter of importance,
they endeavour to procure omens from these kites, and, for this purpose,
invite their approach by screaming songs, and scattering rice before them.
If these birds take their flight in the direction they wish to go, it is regarded
as a favourable omen; but if they take another direction, they
consider it as unfavourable, and delay the business until the omens are
more suitable to their wishes.​&mdash;<em>Transactions of the Batavian Society</em>,

and prophecy, commences by a declaration on the part of <em>Jáya Báya</em>, that
it is clearly ascertained, the island of Java will be annihilated in two
thousand one hundred years from the date of its first existence; and
after detailing every event, down to the Javan year 1743 (the present
year, A.D. 1816), has the following extraordinary conclusion.
</p>
<p>
"The whole of the above chronological relation of events, from the
first year to the present date, was written by the inspired <em>Aji Jáya
Báya</em>, who himself lived about the year 800. What follows is a continuation
of events which were foretold by him, and which are still to
happen, viz.
</p>
<p>
"In the year 1801, <em>Sura-kerta</em> being no more, the seat of government
will be removed to <em>Katáng'ga</em>, which being afterwards demolished, the
seat of government will be removed in 1870 to <em>Kárang Báya</em>.
</p>
<p>
"In 1950, the seat of government will be removed to <em>Kedíri</em>, where it
was of old. The <em>Pringi</em> people (Europeans) will then come, and
having conquered Java, will establish a government in the year 1955.
The Prince of <em>Kling</em>, however, hearing of the conquest and ruin of
Java by the <em>Príngis</em>, will send a force which will defeat and drive them
out of Java; and having given up the island once more to its Javan
government, will, in the year 1960, return to his own country.
</p>
<p>
"On regaining possession of the country, the new Javan government
will desert the former capital of <em>Kárang Báya</em>, as being an unlucky
site, and remove it to <em>Waríngin Kúbu</em>, which is near the mountain
<em>N'gmárta Láya</em>. This will take place in 2020.

may be interesting to add the equally popular and generally received
ancient history of <em>Madúra</em>, formerly called <em>Mandúra</em>, and in the <em>basa</em>, or
court language, <em>Mandurétna</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Batara Rama Yana</em> having completed the wars, and conquered <em>Dasa
Muka</em>, of the country of <em>Alinka</em>, thought of making a new settlement
from the wilderness. To this he gave the name of <em>Durjayapura</em>; and
after a long reign, resigned the government of it to his son, <em>Butlawa</em>,
ending his days in solitude. <em>Butlawa</em> reigned for some years over the
country of <em>Durjayapura</em>, and was succeeded by his son, <em>Kunti Buja</em>,
who married the daughter of his <em>Páteh</em>, named <em>Kasa</em>. This prince removed
the seat of government, or rather changed the name of it, to
<em>Mandura Rája</em>, and was succeeded by his son, <em>Basu Keti</em>, who ascended
the throne at nine years of age. During his reign there arrived a beautiful
woman, named <em>Dewi Sani Gatra</em>, daughter of <em>Bengawan Adi Rusa</em>,
who had fled from the Prince of <em>Nusa Kambangán</em>, called <em>Jura Mataraja</em>.
The prince married her, and was in consequence attacked by <em>Jura
Mataraja</em>; but by the assistance of <em>Pula Sara</em>, the father of <em>Abiasa</em>, who
afterwards became sovereign of <em>Astina</em>, he defeated him, and remained
in quiet possession of his country. By the princess he had four children;
three sons, named <em>Basu Dewa</em>, <em>Aria Prabu</em>, and <em>Angrasana</em>, and a
daughter named <em>Dewi Kunti</em>. When <em>Basu Dewa</em> was fifteen years of age,
his father wished him to marry a princess of the country, but the youth
having fixed his affections upon the daughter of <em>Raja Sirwonga</em>, named
<em>Dewi Angsa Wati</em>, refused compliance, and was in consequence dismissed from
the royal presence.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Basu Dewa</em>, learning that the daughter of <em>Sirwonga</em> had been carried
off by a giant into the woods, succeeded in overpowering the giant, and
married <em>Dewi Angsa Wati</em>; but intelligence being given thereof to the
chief, the prince of <em>Ambulutiga</em>, a chief called <em>Tiga Warna</em> (tri-coloured)
was sent in pursuit of <em>Basu Dewa</em>, whom he overtook on his return to
<em>Mandura Raja</em>. <em>Basu Dewa</em> was vanquished and fell into a cave: the
princess fell into the hands of <em>Tiga Warna</em>.
</p>
<p>
"It was about this time that <em>Pula Sara</em> obtained the kingdom of <em>Astina</em>
for his son <em>Abiasa</em>, and was desirous of betrothing him to <em>Dewa Ambalika</em>
of <em>Astina</em>; but the young prince would not consent; and one day,
when he was wandering in the forests, he heard a voice issue from a
cave, and discovered <em>Basu Dewa</em>, who related his case and intreated his
aid in the recovery of his wife. The young princes then proceeded in
search of <em>Tiga Warna</em>, and having discovered him, <em>Basu Dewa</em> discharged
an arrow at him and killed him. <em>Dewi Ansga Wati</em> was in consequence
restored to her husband. <em>Basu Dewa</em> and <em>Abiasa</em> then exchanged vows
of perpetual friendship between themselves and their descendants, invoking
a curse upon whomsoever of them should be guilty of breaking
it. After this, <em>Basu Dewa</em> returned to <em>Mandura Raja</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Basu Dewa</em> at length succeeded his father in the government of <em>Mandura
Raja</em>, and had several children; of whom one was white, named
<em>Kakra Sana</em>, the other black, named <em>Kresna</em>. He was succeeded by a son
whom he had exposed in the woods, but to whom he afterwards became
reconciled, named <em>Raden Kangsa</em>, to whom he gave the country. At
this time <em>Pandu Dewa Nata</em> reigned over the kingdom of <em>Astina</em>. One
night a voice said to him in a dream, 'When you meet with children of
<em>Madura</em>, white or black, put them to death.' His father, who was still
living, apprehensive for the fate of his favourite sons, <em>Kakra Sana</em> and
Kresna, sent them to <em>Widara Kandang</em> for concealment, with <em>Angga Gopa</em>.
These two princes afterwards hearing of an exhibition of fighting men,
proceeded with their sister <em>Sambádra</em> to the <em>Alun alun</em>, where the combatants
were assembled, and here they met <em>Raden Aria Jenaka</em> and <em>Sena</em>,
sons of <em>Pandu Dewa Nata</em>, from <em>Astina</em>, who when their father died heard
of the fame of <em>Madura</em>, and came in quest of the country.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raden Kangsa</em> was seated in the <em>paseban</em>, surrounded by his chiefs,
when his <em>Páteh</em> informed him that the proscribed children had at last
appeared. The prince, delighted that those whom he had so long sought
in vain had now appeared of their own accord, ordered his <em>Páteh</em> immediately
to seize them; but <em>Kakra Sana</em> fought with the <em>Páteh</em>, and drove
him back upon the prince, who then seized him himself, and throwing
him on the ground with violence, blood gushed from his mouth. <em>Kakra
Sana</em> then called for assistance from <em>Krésna</em>, who with <em>Raden Sena</em> immediately
came and overpowered <em>Raden Kangsa</em>. Upon this Kakra
Sana put him to death with his weapon <em>Lugúra</em>. The <em>Páteh</em>, ignorant
of the fate of his prince, rushed upon the parties, but was pierced with
a spear by <em>Kakra Sana</em>, who immediately exclaimed, 'I am <em>Resi Anapita</em>
of <em>Repat Kapanasan</em>; I am <em>Resi di Jala dana Baladewa</em>, the son of <em>Basu
Dewa</em> of <em>Madura</em>.'
</p>
<p>
"Then his uncle, <em>Aria Prabu</em>, spoke; and having embraced him, carried
him to his father, <em>Basu Dewa</em>, who conferred the country upon him. At
night, however, <em>Kakra Sana</em> heard a voice in his sleep, saying, 'to-morrow
will I be revenged in the war <em>Brata Yudha</em>: there will be one of
the country <em>Chámpala Raja</em>, I am he.' <em>Kakra Sana</em> replied, 'well I
dare you.'"</p></div>

of <em>Synmu</em>, of Christ 540.
</p>
<p>
"He was a very religious prince, and very favourably inclined to the
foreign pagan <em>Budsdo</em> worship, which during his reign spread with
great success in Japan, insomuch that the emperor himself caused
several temples to be built to foreign idols, and ordered the idol of
<em>Buds</em>, or <em>Fotoge</em>, to be carved in <em>Fakkusai</em>, that is in China.
</p>
<p>
"My Japanese author mentions what follows, as something very
remarkable, and says, that it happened in the thirty-first year of his
reign, and contributed very much to the advancement of the <em>Budsdo</em>
religion. About a thousand years ago, says my author, there was in
"<em>Tsiutensiku</em> (that is the middle <em>Tensiku</em>, whereby must be understood
the country of the Malabarians and the coast of Coromandel in India)
an eminent <em>fotoke</em> called <em>Mokuren</em>, a disciple of <em>Siaka</em>. About the same
time the doctrine of <em>Jambaden Gonna Niorai</em> (that is, <em>Amida</em> the great
god and patron of departed souls) was brought over into China, or
<em>Fakkusai</em>, and spread into the neighbouring countries. This doctrine,
continues he, did now manifest itself also in <em>Tsinokuni</em>, or Japan, at a
place called <em>Naniwa</em>, where the idol of <em>Amida</em> appeared at the entry of
a pond, environed with golden rays, nobody knowing how it was conveyed
thither. The pious emperor, in memory of this miraculous
event, instituted the first <em>Nengo</em> in Japan, and called it <em>Konquo</em>. The
idol itself was by <em>Tondo Josijmitz</em>, a prince of great courage and piety,
carried into the country of <em>Sinano</em>, and placed in the temple of <em>Sinquosi</em>,
where it afterwards, by the name of <em>Sinquosi Norai</em> (that is, the
<em>Norai</em> or <em>Amida</em> of <em>Sinquosi</em>) wrought many great miracles, which made
that temple famous all over the empire. Thus far my Japanese author.
He was succeeded by his son, <em>Fit Atzu</em>, or <em>Fint Atz</em>, in the year of
<em>Synmu</em> 1232, of Christ 572. My author makes no mention of his age,
but sets down the following remarkable events which happened during
his reign.
</p>
<p>
"In the third year of his reign, on the first day of the first month, was
born at the emperor's court <em>Sotoktais</em>, the great apostle of the Japanese.
His birth was preceded and attended with several remarkable
circumstances.
</p>
<p>
"The idol worship in general increased greatly in Japan during the
emperor's reign. Abundance of idols, and idol carvers, and priests,
came from several countries beyond sea.
</p>
<p>
"In the eighth year of his reign the first image of <em>Siaka</em> was brought
over from beyond sea, and carried to <em>Nara</em> into the temple of <em>Kobusi</em>,
where it is still kept in great veneration, possessed of the chief and
most eminent place in that temple.
</p>
<p>
"In the fourteenth year of his reign one <em>Moria</em>, a great antagonist
and professed enemy of <em>Sotoktais</em>, occasioned great troubles and religious
dissensions in the empire. He bore a mortal hatred to all the
<em>Fotoge</em> or idols of the country, which he took out of the temples and
burnt wherever he could come at them: but within two years time his
enemies got the better of him, for he was overcome, and paid with his
life for his presumptuous enterprise. It is added, that having thrown
the ashes of the idols, which he had burnt, into a lake, there arose
suddenly a most dreadful storm of thunder, lightning, and rain."​&mdash;<em>History
of Japan by Kempfer</em>, vol. i. page 167.
</p>
<p>
It is remarkable, that a peculiar people seem to have traversed Mexico
in the following century, and according to Humboldt in like manner to
have left behind them traces of cultivation and civilization. "The
<em>Toultecs</em>," says that eminent author, "appeared first in 648, the
<em>Chichimecs</em> in 1170, the <em>Nahualtics</em> in 1178, and the <em>Aztecs</em> in 1196.
The <em>Toultecs</em> introduced the cultivation of maize and cotton; they
built cities, made roads, and constructed those great pyramids which
are yet admired, and of which the faces are very accurately laid out.
They knew the use of hieroglyphical paintings; they could found
metals and cut the hardest stones, and they had a solar year more
perfect than that of the Greeks or Romans. The form of their
government indicated that they were the descendants of a people, who
had experienced great vicissitudes in their social state." "But where,"
asks Humboldt, "is the source of that cultivation; where is the country
from which the Toultecs and Mexicans issued?"​&mdash;<em>Humboldt's Political
Essay on New Spain.</em></p></div>

as being demanded in marriage by the son of the Mahomedan <em>Raja</em> of
<em>Malacca</em>, and the story, in which an account is evidently given of a visit to
Java at a much later period of its history, blended with the earlier
romances of Java, after detailing the particulars by which the prince of
<em>Tanjung-pura</em> became <em>Raja</em> of <em>Majapáhit</em>, is thus told:
</p>
<p>
"The <em>Batára</em> had a daughter, named <em>Raden Galu Chandra Kirana</em>,
"whose beauty was celebrated far and wide, and many <em>Rajas</em> sought her
in marriage. Her fame reached <em>Malacca</em>, and <em>Sultan Mansur</em> became
enamoured of her by description. He ordered <em>Paduka Raja</em>, the
<em>Bendahara</em>, to fit out a fleet of five hundred large <em>prahus</em> with innumerable
small ones. At <em>Singapura</em> were fitted out a hundred with three
masts, and at <em>Singi Raya</em> as many more of the same sort.
</p>
<p>
"Then the prince selected forty nobles of the country, and forty
virgins of noble family. He summoned <em>Maha Ruja Merlang</em> of <em>Indragiri</em>,
and the <em>Raja</em> of <em>Palémbang</em>, the <em>Raja</em> of <em>Jambi</em>, and the <em>Raja</em>
of <em>Linga</em>, to attend him to <em>Majapahit</em>; all the young warriors attending
the prince, and all the great men remaining for the government of the
country.
</p>
<p>
"When they reached <em>Majapahit</em>, they were well received by the <em>Batara</em>.
At this time the <em>Rajas</em> of <em>Daha</em> and <em>Tanjungpura</em>, the younger brothers
of the prince, were present at <em>Majapahit</em>.
</p>
<p>
"Among the chieftains who accompanied the <em>Raja</em> of <em>Malacca</em> was the
celebrated <em>Hang Tuah</em> or <em>Laxamana</em>, who was highly admired, and
exhibited wonderful feats.
</p>
<p>
"The <em>Batara</em> gave his daughter, <em>Chandra Kirana</em>, in marriage to the
<em>Raja</em> of <em>Malacca</em>; and the <em>Batara</em>, delighted with his son-in-law, caused
him to be placed on a seat of equal honour with himself, both on
public occasions and at meals.
</p>
<p>
"Then being about to depart, the <em>Raja</em> requested to be presented with
the kingdom of <em>Indra-giri</em>, which was accordingly given to him. He
then bestowed <em>Siantan</em> on <em>Laxamana</em>, from which time the rulers of
<em>Siantan</em> are descendants of <em>Laxamana</em>.

one day by a man running <em>amok</em>."​&mdash;<em>Malayan Annals.</em></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_257_257" id="Footnote_257_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> According to the traditions of the <em>Sunda</em> people, these two brothers,
<em>Chiong Wanara</em> and <em>Raden Tanduran</em>, were descended from a prince of
<em>Galu</em>, and their empires were divided by the river of <em>Brebes</em>, thence called
<em>Chi Pamali</em>, or the River of Prohibition.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raja Galu</em>, otherwise known by the name of <em>Raja Pamakás</em>, and whose
country was called <em>Bajong Galu</em>, had two sons, named <em>Raden Aria Bang'a</em>
and <em>Tanduran</em>. There was a pestilence in those days, which, carrying
off great numbers of the inhabitants, caused the prince to be much
afflicted in his mind; whereupon, sending for his <em>patéh</em> (or minister),
he thus addressed him: 'Go thou to <em>Bukit Padang</em>, and call one there
named <em>Si Ajar</em>, failing not to bring him along with thee, as it may
perhaps be in his power to administer relief to my distressed and suffering
subjects.' The <em>patéh</em> immediately took leave of his Sovereign,
and repaired forthwith to <em>Bukit Padang</em> to summon <em>Si Ajar</em>, who soon
after appeared before the <em>Raja</em>, presenting him with some herbs which
he had brought for that purpose. When <em>Si Ajar</em> had seated himself in
the usual manner before the monarch, the latter thus addressed him:
'<em>Ajar</em>, a great pestilence at present rages in the country, and makes
great havock amongst my subjects; it is therefore that I have sent for
thee, in hopes that thou mayest be able to put a stop to the mortality
which now prevails.' <em>Ajar</em> immediately replied, 'O <em>Raja</em>, it is my
opinion, that he to whom the country belongs is the proper person to
do what is requisite for the good of it and its inhabitants.' When the
<em>Raja</em> heard these words, he was exceedingly wroth; so much so, that
he was on the point of putting <em>Ajar</em> to instant death, when the latter
thus addressed him; 'Prince! if you are determined to kill me, I
resign my life, but depend upon it you will be made to answer for it,
and that by your own son.' <em>Si Ajar</em> then returned to <em>Bukit Padang</em>,
wherupon <em>Raja Galu</em> thus spoke to his <em>patéh</em>: 'Repair instantly to
<em>Bukit Padang</em>, and put <em>Si Ajar</em> to death; let him not longer live.'
The <em>patéh</em> accordingly went, and having executed the <em>Raja's</em> orders,
returned and reported the circumstance to his prince, who felt much
joy on the occasion. Shortly after this the <em>Raja's</em> concubine became
pregnant, and when her time was come she was delivered of a son,
whose features were exquisitely beautiful. When the prince was informed
of this, he desired the child might be brought to him. The
prince no sooner cast his eyes upon it, than he thought of the words of
<em>Si Ajar</em>; upon which he administered a dose of poison to the child,
which however did not cause its death. He then told his <em>patéh</em> to take
the child, and having put it in a basket, to send it floating down the
river. The <em>patéh</em> took the child, and having disposed of it as he was
ordered, returned and made his master very happy by the report of
what he had done. The basket in which the child was turned adrift on
the river <em>Chitandui</em> being stopped by some stakes placed there by a
fisherman, named <em>Ke Balangantrang</em>, it was picked up and carried home
by him. He was highly pleased with the child, and adopted it, and
gave it the name of <em>Ke Jakah</em>, and cherished it till it arrived at the age
of manhood. <em>Ke Jakah</em> then invited his reputed father to accompany
him to <em>Bajong Galu</em>. They had nearly got half way, when <em>Ke Jakah</em>
looked up and saw a bird fly past. He asked <em>Ke Balangantrang</em> what
might be the name of that bird? and was told that it was called <em>chiong</em>
(the black minor of India). <em>Ke Jakah</em> then saw a form like that of a
human being, and inquiring what it was, he was told that it was a <em>wanara</em>
(monkey). <em>Ke Jakah</em> then exclaimed, 'if such is the case, then
must my name be <em>Chiong Wanara</em>.'
</p>
<p>
"After this the travellers prosecuted their journey, and in due time
arrived at <em>Bajong Galu</em>, where they went to the house of a relation of
<em>Ke Balangantrang</em>, named <em>Ke Haziali</em>, the chief of all the blacksmiths.
<em>Chiong Wanara</em> was then delivered over by <em>Ke Balangantrang</em> to <em>Ke Haziali</em>,
who treated him as his own son, and instructed him in the art, in
which he soon became eminent.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Chiang Wanara</em> had not been long in this new situation, before <em>Raja
Galu</em>, hearing of the circumstance, sent for and begged him of the head
blacksmith. The <em>Raja</em> in time owned him for his own son, and was so
delighted when he first beheld him, that he sent for his son, <em>Raden
Aria Bang'a</em>, and desired him to take every care of his newly-found
brother.
</p>
<p>
"A short time after this, <em>Chiong Wanara</em> went to his royal father, and
asked him to give him some hereditary property. When the <em>Raja</em>
heard this, he immediately addressed <em>Chiong Wanara</em> thus:​&mdash;'My son,
the whole of my property I have bestowed on thy eldest brother, and
nothing is left except the head blacksmith, whom thou hadst better
accept of.' <em>Raden Chiong Wanara</em> said he would take him with much
pleasure.
</p>
<p>
"Soon after the head blacksmith came into his possession, <em>Raden
Chiong Wanara</em> went again to his father, and solicited permission
(which was granted to him) to construct an iron cage of very great
strength, and of the most exquisite workmanship. <em>Chiong Wanara</em>
then gave orders to his head blacksmith to have this cage made, and all
the blacksmiths in the kingdom having been set about it, it was very
soon finished, and had all the strength and beauty that was intended
and wished for. Carpets and cushions, such as princes are accustomed
to recline on, were spread within it. <em>Chiong Wanara</em> then went and
acquainted <em>Raja Galu</em> that it was completed. When the <em>Raja</em> saw it,
he was greatly pleased, and being entreated by <em>Chiong Wanara</em> to enter
and examine whether or not there might be still something wanting to
render it more complete; without suspecting any treachery, he did as
he was requested. No sooner was he fairly in, than <em>Chiong Wanara</em>
closed and locked the door, saying, at the same time to <em>Raja Galu</em>,
'Now is fulfilled the prediction of <em>Ajar</em> of <em>Bukit Padang</em>, whom you
caused to be unjustly put to death.' The <em>Raja</em> answered from within
the cage, 'I submit to this just judgment.'
</p>
<p>
"When <em>Raden Aria Bang'a</em> saw his father shut up in the cage, he
could not contain his rage against <em>Chiong Wanara</em>, and a quarrel
between the two brothers ensued.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raja Galu</em> perceiving this, immediately exclaimed, 'For shame!
that two brothers should thus fight with each other; such conduct is
strictly forbidden by the elders of the people.'
</p>
<p>
"Without paying any regard to the words or admonition of <em>Raja Galu</em>,
the two brothers engaged in single combat, stabbing, pushing, and
striking each other in turn. Both parties being of equal strength, they
continued fighting all the way from the place above described until
they got far to the eastward, when finding themselves fatigued, they
suspended the conflict under a certain tree. <em>Chiong Wanara</em> forthwith
asked his brother what the name of the tree was under which they
were: <em>Aria Bang'a</em> answered, it is called <em>mája</em>. They then took one of
the fruit, and having split it in two, each took a part. That which
<em>Aria Bang'a</em> ate was sweet, but that which <em>Chiong Wanara</em> ate was on
the contrary very bitter (<em>pait</em>); so <em>Chiong Wanara</em> called the place
<em>Majapait</em>, or as more generally pronounced, <em>Majapahit</em>.
</p>
<p>
"The combat was then renewed with the same vigour as before, and
they continued fighting towards the westward, until they came to a
row of trees (<em>jajar</em>), where they halted. On being asked by his brother
the name of those trees, <em>Chiong Wanara</em> answered <em>paku</em>: <em>Raden Aria
Bang'a</em> then said, 'the name of the place must be <em>Pakuan Pa-jajar-an</em>.'
</p>
<p>
"The two brothers then recommenced fighting, till they came to a
river of <em>Brebes</em>, where being both much fatigued, they rested by the
side of it and drank of its water.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raden Aria Bang'a</em> then said: 'It was declared by our father to be
wrong for brothers to fight with each other, it is also contrary to
ancient usage, let us therefore put an end to this forbidden contest,
and let us call this river <em>Chi Pamali</em>' (that is to say, the river of prohibition).
The river <em>Brebes</em> thus obtained the name of <em>Chi Pamali</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raden Aria Bang'a</em> then said to his brother: 'do thou go to <em>Pakuan
Pajajaran</em> while I go to <em>Majapahit</em>.' They accordingly separated,
<em>Raden Aria Bang'a</em> proceeding to <em>Majapahit</em>, and <em>Chiong Wanara</em>
returning to <em>Bajong Galu</em>, for the purpose of visiting his father in the
cage.
</p>
<p>
"When <em>Chiong Wanara</em> arrived at <em>Bajong Galu</em>, and found the cage
empty, his astonishment was very great. He then addressed himself to
one of his people, named <em>Ke Jampang</em>, and asked what was become of
<em>Raja Galu</em>. <em>Ke Jampang</em> replied, 'he went out of the cage of himself,
without the assistance of any one, and has returned to his usual place
of residence at <em>Surga Luka</em>, where he now is, having assumed the name
and title of <em>Guru Putra Hinga Baya</em>.'
</p>
<p>
"When <em>Chiong Wanara</em> heard all this he thought he might as well
throw away the empty cage, which he accordingly did, on the beach of
the south coast, from whence the place is called <em>Tana Kandang Wesi</em>, or
the land of the Iron Cage.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Chiong Wanara</em> forthwith invited <em>Ke Jampang</em> to accompany him to
<em>Surga Luka</em>, in search of his father, <em>Guru Putra Hinga Baya</em>.
</p>
<p>
"In a short time they arrived at <em>Surga Luka</em>, and <em>Chiong Wanara</em> surrendered
himself, entreating his father's forgiveness for what had passed.
<em>Guru Putra</em> then said, 'to a certainty there must be two kingdoms on
the island of Java, of which the (intermediate) boundary will be the
river <em>Pamali</em>. The kingdom of <em>Raden Tanduran</em> will be to the eastward,
and shall be called <em>Majapahit</em>; that of <em>Chiong Wanara</em> will be to
the westward, and shall be called <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em>: the latter kingdom
will cease first (<em>tunda dahulu</em>.') Whence the people under <em>Chiong
Wanara</em> were called <em>Orang Sunda</em>, and their language <em>Sunda</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Guru Putra</em> then gave <em>Chiong Wanara</em> a black monkey-skin jacket,
which the latter forthwith put on, and immediately became in appearance
like that animal. He at the same time gave him the name of <em>Guru
Minda-sida tanda Prabu lutung Kasarong</em>, and furnished him with some
rice-seed, and appointed <em>Ke Jampang</em> to be his follower.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Guru Minda</em> and <em>Ke Jampang</em> then took their departure: and when
they came to a place not far from <em>Bajong Galu</em> they set out about sowing
their rice-seed, distributing it among all the poor people of the place for
that purpose.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Pandi Chacha Domas</em> and all the <em>Peng'gawas</em>, as well as all the people
of <em>Bajong Galu</em>, who were attached to <em>Chiong Wanara</em> at the time he
went to see <em>Guru Putra Hinga Baya</em> of <em>Surga Luka</em>, being without a
sovereign, went all of them to the eastward, to reside in the country of
<em>Majapahit</em>.
</p>
<p>
"When <em>Prabu Lutung Kasarong</em> had given orders for the sowing of the
rice, he and his follower, <em>Ke Jampang</em>, proceeded to a place on the south
sea coast, called <em>Kedu Pondok</em>, where <em>Ke Jampang</em> being left to settle, the
place took its name from him, and was ever after called <em>Chutak Jampang</em>.
</p>
<p>
"After <em>Prabu Lutung Kasarong</em> had left <em>Ke Jampang</em> at <em>Kedu Pondok</em>
he went through the woods, till coming near <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em> he found
a very large tree, called <em>pundi</em>, situated on the banks of the river <em>Chili-wong</em>.
He remained under it to rest himself, and gave the place the
name of <em>Kampung Pundi</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Kuwu Mangkubumbi</em>, of <em>Jambadipa</em>, in the district of <em>Jelebud</em>, had several
children, all of them females. The youngest was called <em>Purba
Sari</em>, and was established in the interior, near the tree called <em>gadug</em>,
from which the <em>kampung</em> so called took its name.
</p>
<p>
"Having placed his youngest daughter, <em>Purba Sari</em>, in the interior of
the country, he was desirous to send out people to shoot birds with a
pellet, and accordingly created and appointed one a pellet-shooter, who
went regularly every day to shoot, agreeably to the order of <em>Kuwu
Mangkubumi</em>. One day the pellet-shooter came to the large <em>pundi</em> tree,
and observing on it what he supposed to be a large black monkey, he
wished to shoot it, whereupon <em>Prabu Lutung Kasarong</em>, whom he mistook
for the monkey, thus addressed him: 'Don't shoot at me; you
had better go home and tell your master to come here to me himself.'
When the pellet-shooter perceived that the black monkey was gifted
with speech he stood aghast and astonished beyond measure, and returned
immediately to his master to acquaint him with the circumstance.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Kuwu Mangubumi</em>, together with the pellet-shooter, then repaired to
the great <em>pundi</em> tree. On his arrival there he called to <em>Prabu Lutung
Kasarong</em>, who was upon it. No sooner did the latter hear the summons,
than he descended and talked with the <em>Kuwu</em>, who then took him home
with him, highly delighted at being possessed of so extraordinary and
accomplished a creature. In the course of a short time he wished to
present him to his eldest daughter, and on her refusing to accept of him
he offered him to a younger one, but neither would receive <em>Prabu
Lutung Kasarong</em>.
</p>
<p>
"He then gave him to the youngest of all, named <em>Niái Purba Sari</em>, who
accepted of him with great pleasure.
</p>
<p>
"In the course of time, <em>Niai Purba Sari</em> built a house at <em>Wangun</em>, and
the place was afterwards called <em>Kampung Wangun</em>. He then planted
some <em>tagur</em> trees, from which the place received the name of <em>Kampung
Tagur</em>. After this, <em>Prabu Lutung Kasarong</em> caused <em>Niai Purba Sari</em> to
remove from the <em>gaduga</em> tree to <em>Kampung Wangun</em>.
</p>
<p>
"When <em>Niai Purba Sari</em> became <em>Prabu Lutung's</em> wife, he laid aside the
black monkey's skin with which he was clothed, and immediately resumed
his former and usual beautiful appearance.
</p>
<p>
"He afterwards received the name of <em>Niang Galarang</em>, and established
himself at <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em>, where the <em>Batutulis</em> (inscribed stone) now
is, and which was the seat of government of the <em>Maha Raja Prabu Niang
Galarang</em>. After this his wife became pregnant, and <em>Prabu Niang
Galarang</em> left <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em> to the care of his <em>Peng'gawas</em>, or ministers
of state, and went to <em>Bukit Padang</em>, where he became a <em>Pandita</em>.
</p>
<p>
"When the time was come, <em>Niai Purba Sari</em> brought forth a son of the
most exquisitely beautiful features, to whom she gave the name
<em>Silawang'i</em>.
</p>
<p>
"When <em>Silawang'i</em> grew up, he removed from <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em> to
<em>Sumedang Larang</em>, where he was soon afterwards married; first to <em>Niai
Raden Raja Mantu</em>, and then to the daughter of the <em>Peng'gawa</em> of that
place, so that he had many wives. He at the same time received the
title of <em>Baginda Maha Raja Prabu Silawang'i</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Prabu Lutung Kasarong</em> had afterwards two other sons, the elder
named <em>Ke Glap Nyawang</em>, the younger, <em>Ke Kedang Panjang</em>, both of
whom were strong and well made; and when they grew up they went
with their father to <em>Sumedang Larang</em>, where they all remained with
<em>Prabu Silawang'i</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Prabu Silawang'i</em>, when he had got a number of wives and <em>peng'gawas</em>,
returned to <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em>, bringing them all with him, as also his
two sons, and his man <em>Ke Jampang</em>, who was then called <em>Purwa Kala</em>.
In returning to <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em>, <em>Prabu Silawang'i</em> first went to a place
on the south coast, called <em>Nusa Kambangan</em>, and there embarking in a
vessel with all his family, he sailed westward, till they came to the
anchoring place, to which was given the name of <em>Palabuan Ratu</em> (Wyn
Coops Bay), and having disembarked, they all proceeded to <em>Pakuan
Pajajáran</em>.
</p>
<p>
"On his arrival there, <em>Prabu Silawang'i</em> established himself as <em>Raja</em>,
and having assembled all the <em>Mantris</em>, <em>Peng'gawas</em>, and other chiefs and
officers, together with all the military forces, he caused great rejoicings
to be made on the occasion, and each day and night every kind of play
was performed to amuse him. <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em> was crowded with the
happy and delighted multitude, and so great and powerful did <em>Prabu
Silawang'i</em> become at that time, that all the princes from the river <em>Chi
Pamali</em> beyond Java Head (in Bantam) on the west, submitted to him
and were subject to <em>Pakuan Pajajaran</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Prabu Silawang'i</em> then built without the <em>kraton</em> (or palace) a hall of
audience (<em>paseban</em>), which was styled <em>Sasaka Domas</em>, or the hall of eight
hundred pillars; and in the interior of the <em>kraton</em> another, called <em>Rarawis
Kanchana</em> (or that of golden flowers). This was where the <em>Batutulis</em>
now is."
</p>
<p>
The tradition goes on to relate, that <em>Prabu Silawang'i</em> had one hundred
and fifty wives, and that his sons-in-law, of whom there were also one
hundred and fifty, were made great public officers.
</p>
<p>
In the course of a little time one of his highness's wives, named <em>Niai Mantri
Manek Mayang Sunda</em>, the sister of <em>Ke Marugal Sang Mantri Ayung</em>, became
pregnant, and in due time brought forth a beautiful boy, who was called by
his father <em>Raden Guru Gatangan</em>, and who was made <em>Raja Muda</em> of <em>Pakuan
Pajajaran</em>, with the name and title of <em>Prabu Guru Gantangan</em>.
</p>
<p>
Both father and son continued as <em>Raja Tuah</em> and <em>Raja Muda</em> to live in
the <em>kraton of Pakuan Pajajaran</em>, happy and on good terms with each other;
the management and direction of the state being entirely vested in the hands
of the <em>Raja Muda</em>.</p></div>

respecting the establishment of foreign colonies in the Eastern Archipelago,
and brought down this part of the history to the establishment of the kingdom
of <em>Majapahit</em>, it may not be amiss to transcribe those which prevail
among the <em>Malayus</em>, who, it is well known, endeavour to trace their descent
from the Macedonian hero, Alexander the Great. The following account
is taken from the <em>Sejara Maláyu</em>, or Malay annals, a work written in the
year 1021 of Hejirat:
</p>
<p>
"It happened that <em>Raja Sekander</em>, the son of <em>Raja Darub</em> of <em>Rum</em>, of the
race of <em>Makaduniah</em>, the name of whose empire was <em>Zulkarneini</em>, wished
to see the rising of the sun, and for this purpose came to the confines of
the land of Hind. There was a Raja in Hindustan, named <em>Raja Kideh
Hindi</em>, who was very powerful, and whose empire extended over the half
of Hindustan. Immediately on the approach of <em>Raja Sekander</em>, <em>Raja
Kideh Hindi</em> sent his prime minister to collect his forces, and marched
out to meet him. The armies engaged, and a battle ensued, as is fully
recorded in the history of <em>Raja Sekander</em>. <em>Raja Kideh Hindi</em> was defeated
and taken prisoner, after which he was sent back to his own country.
This <em>Raja Kideh</em> had a daughter: after sending his minister, <em>Perdana
Mantri</em>, to consult with the minister of <em>Raja Sekander</em>, he gave her in
marriage to <em>Raja Sekander</em>, on condition of receiving three hundred
thousand dinars of gold.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raja Sekander</em>, after tarrying ten days in honour of the ceremony,
pursued his journey towards the rising sun, attended by his bride. On
their return, however, her father requested her to remain some time with
him: <em>Raja Sekander</em> consented and took his leave.
</p>
<p>
"The princess was already pregnant by <em>Raja Sekander</em>, but he was unacquainted
with this circumstance; nor was the princess herself aware of
it, till a month after her return to her father. At the expiration of her
time, the princess was safely delivered of a son, whom <em>Raja Kideh Hindi</em>
named <em>Aristan Shah</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raja Aristan Shah</em> was in course of time married to the daughter of
the Raja of <em>Turkistan</em>, by whom he had a son, named <em>Raja Aftus</em>.
</p>
<p>
"After an absence of forty-five years, <em>Raja Sekander</em> returned to <em>Makaduniah</em>,
and <em>Raja Kideh Hindi</em> died, leaving as his successor <em>Raja Aristan
Shah</em>, who (or rather whose dynasty) reigned three hundred and fifty
years. After him reigned the following princes in succession:
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Aftus</em>,          who reigned one hundred and twenty years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Askayinat</em>,            do.      three years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Kasidas</em>,              do.      twelve years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Amastubusu</em>,           do.      thirteen years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Zamzeius</em>,             do.      seven years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Khuras Khainat</em>        do.      thirty years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Ahat Sakayinat</em>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Kuda Zuguhan</em>, son of <em>Amastubusu</em>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Nikubus</em>, who reigned forty years.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Ardasir Migan</em>, who married the daughter of <em>Raja Nushirwan Adel</em>,
sovereign of the west, by whom he had a son, named <em>Raja Derm Nus</em>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Tarsia Burdaras</em>, son of <em>Raja Zamarut</em>.
</p>
<p>
The last of these princes married the daughter of <em>Raja Sulan</em> of <em>Amdan
Nagara</em>. This <em>Raja Sulan</em> was the mightiest prince of the land of
Hind, and of all the Rajas under the wind. By the princess, his
daughter, <em>Raja Narsa</em> had three sons:
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Herian</em>, who reigned in the country of Hindostan:
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Suren</em>, whom <em>Raja Sulan</em> appointed in his own place; and
</p>
<p>
<em>Raja Panden</em>, who reigned in <em>Turkestan</em>.
</p>
<p>
"After a short time <em>Raja Sulan</em> died, and his grandson, <em>Raja Suren</em>,
reigned in his place in <em>Amdan Nagara</em>, with still greater authority than
his predecessors, and all the lands of the East and West, except China,
acknowledged him.
</p>
<p>
"Then <em>Raja Suren</em> formed the design of subjugating China, and for this
purpose marched towards that country. Two months he marched on
without any obstruction, and every country submitted, till he approached
the country of <em>Gang'ga Nagara</em>, the Raja of which was named
<em>Gang'gi Shah Juana</em>. Here an engagement took place, in which <em>Raja
Suren</em> smote off the head of <em>Raja Gang'gi Shah Juana</em>, whose subjects
having lost their chief submitted to <em>Raja Suren</em>, who married <em>Patri
Gang'ga</em>, the sister of the deceased Raja. From <em>Gang'ga Nagara, Raja
Suren</em> advanced to the country of <em>Klang Kins</em>, which in former times was
a great country, possessing a fort of black stone (supposed to be up
the river <em>Johor</em>). The name of the Raja of this country was <em>Chulen</em>,
who was superior to all the Rajas of the country lying under the wind.
Here another desperate engagement took place, in which <em>Raja Chulen</em>
also was killed, and the country submitted to <em>Suren</em>. Then <em>Raja Suren</em>
married the daughter of the deceased monarch, and advanced to <em>Tamarak</em>.
He returned, however, to the land of <em>Kling</em> without proceeding on to
China. On the return of <em>Raja Suren</em> he founded a city of great size,
the fame of which became renowned, and the name of which was <em>Bisnagur</em>
(a well known and celebrated city of the south of India), which
even at the present time is a great city in the land of <em>Kling</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Raja Suren</em> had by the daughter of <em>Raja Chulen</em> a daughter, named
<em>Chandu Wani Wasias</em>, and by <em>Putri Gang'ga</em> he had three sons, one
of them named <em>Bichitram Shah</em>, another <em>Palidutani</em>, and the third
<em>Nilumanam</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Palidutani</em> succeeded to the government of <em>Amden Nagara</em>, and <em>Nilumanam</em>
was appointed to the government of <em>Chandukani</em>: but on the
eldest son, <em>Bichitram Shah</em>, was only conferred a territory of small extent,
which so displeased the young prince, that he resolved to abandon
the country. He accordingly embarked with twenty vessels, fitted out
with all the appurtenances of war, determining to conquer all the maritime
countries; but his fleet was dispersed by a storm, and part of them
returned to their country.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Bichitram Shah</em> is then represented as arriving in the country now
called <em>Palembang</em>, where <em>Demang Lebar Daon</em>, great grandson of <em>Raja
Chulen</em>, was chief. Here marrying the daughter of the Raja, he assumed
the government, under the title of <em>Sang Sapurba Trimurti Tribuna</em>, and
had by her four children; two daughters, named <em>Chandra Dewi</em> and
<em>Putra Sri Dewi</em>, and two sons, named <em>Sang Mutiaga</em> and <em>Sang Nila
Utama</em>.
</p>
<p>
"After some years <em>Sang Sapurba</em> was seized with a desire to view the
ocean, and went in search of a good situation for a new settlement,
leaving the younger brother of <em>Demang Lebar Daon</em> in the government
of <em>Palembang</em>; and the fleet being prepared, they set sail from the river
of <em>Palembang</em>, and after steering six days and nights towards the south,
arrived at <em>Tanj'ung pura</em>, where <em>Sang Sapurba</em> was very honourably received
by the Raja, and a thousand chiefs introduced him into the country,
seated him on the throne, and honoured him like a prince. As soon as
the news of his arrival reached <em>Majapáhit</em>, the <em>Bitara</em>, who was very
powerful, came to make him a visit. <em>Sang Sapurba</em> received him very
graciously, and gave him in marriage his daughter <em>Chandra Dewi</em>. After
this ceremony the <em>Bitara</em> of <em>Majapáhit</em> returned to his capital; and it
is from this marriage (say the Malayan traditions) that the rajas of <em>Majapáhit</em>
are descended.
</p>
<p>
"After a long residence at <em>Tanj'ung pura, Sang Sapurba</em> set out again
in search of some other country; but he first married his son, <em>Sang Mutiaga</em>,
to the daughter of the Raja <em>Tanj'ung pura</em>, and established him on
the throne of that country, giving him a superb crown. After leaving
<em>Tanj'ung pura</em> he traversed the sea until he arrived in the strait of
<em>Sambor</em>, in view of the hills of <em>Ling'ga</em> (Lingen.) The news quickly
reached <em>Bentan</em>, at this time under the sway of a queen, named <em>Pramiswari
Sehander Shah</em>. <em>Sang Nita Utama</em>, the younger son of <em>Sang Sapurba</em>,
was married to her daughter, named <em>Wan Sri Bini</em>, and afterwards
became raja of the country.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Sang Sapurba</em> then left <em>Bentan</em>, and having sailed for a day and a
night, arrived at <em>Ruko</em>, whence he proceeded to the point of <em>Balang</em>, and
ascended the river <em>Buantan</em>, where it was reported the country was extremely
populous. When he had ascended far up the river he arrived at
<em>Menangkabau</em>: all the <em>Menangkabaus</em> were surprized at his appearance,
and the splendour of his diadem, and they all came to inquire whence
he came. As soon as they heard of his adventures, and that he was a
descendant of Sultan <em>Sekander Zulkarneiné</em>, all the chief men of <em>Menangkabau</em>
consulted about appointing him Raja, since they had none;
and after he had, as a condition, succeeded in destroying an immense
snake which harassed the country, he was unanimously elected Raja by
the people of <em>Buantan</em>, and of him are descended all the generations of
the Rajas of <em>Pagaruyang</em>.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Sang Nila Utama</em> afterwards quitted <em>Bentan</em>, and founded the city of
<em>Singa pura</em>, situated on the southern extremity of the Malayan peninsula.
This event is supposed to have taken place A.D. 1160.
</p>
<p>
"The successors of <em>Sang Nila Utama</em> were <em>Paduka Sri Wikrama</em>, <em>Sri
Rama Wikrama</em>, and <em>Sekander Shah</em>, who, being driven out of <em>Singa pura</em>
by the <em>Majapáhit</em> forces, afterwards established the city of <em>Malaca</em>. His
successor, <em>Mahomed Shah</em>, first embraced Mahomedanism, in the year
1276."​&mdash;<em>Malayan Annals.</em></p></div>

the royal family of <em>Báli</em> consisted of three brothers; the eldest of whom
was named <em>Maya Dináwa</em>; the second, <em>Dewa Machuwel</em>, who was the
chief; and the youngest, <em>Kabu Wihaha</em>. <em>Kabu Wihaha</em> is said to have
been of extraordinary size, and to have had a head like a hog, devouring
the flesh of that animal in great quantity. He was, moreover, very
wicked and destructive, regardless of the rights or property of any one.
On this account the people became dissatisfied with his sway, and his
brothers, desirous of getting rid of him, advised him to proceed to
<em>Majapáhit</em>, in order to obtain in marriage <em>Loro Jongrang</em>, of the family
of <em>Browijaya</em>, a lady whom they represented as of a stature similar to
his own. The Raja of <em>Báli</em>, as a further inducement to him to go, sent
an embassy to make the request; but <em>Browijaya</em>, considering it as the
forerunner of war, made his preparations accordingly. He sent for a
celebrated painter, named <em>Sung'ing adi Warna</em>, and putting down the
dimensions of a large woman, such as had been requested, desired him
to paint the figure of a most beautiful woman of the same size, and when
it was done dismissed the ambassadors, accompanied by <em>Aria Damar</em>,
who had especial instructions to make observations of every thing in
<em>Báli</em>, to that the way might be clear for hostilities, should the same
become necessary."</p></div>

subjects were very numerous, and they could not succeed<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The water of that country is called <em>pa-chak-an</em>. Here is the mouth
of a river. This is the place to invade the country. It was here that
<em>Su-pit</em> and <em>Rohin</em>, the generals of <em>Hut-pit-lyat</em>, fought the people of the
country.
</p>
<p>
"The country of <em>Jaw-wa</em> is divided between two kings, one to the
west, and one to the east. In the reign of the Emperor <em>Chee-Te</em>, of the
dynasty of <em>Beng</em>, when that prince had sat five years on the throne, the
western prince, whose name was <em>Fo-wan-pan</em>, made war on the prince of
the eastern half of the island, and overthrew his kingdom.
</p>
<p>
"In the reign of the same Chinese prince, and in the sixteenth year of
his reign, the western king of <em>Jaw-wa</em>, whose name now was <em>Yang-wi-see-sa</em>,
sent a mission to China, with a present of a white parrot.
</p>
<p>
"Half a day's journey to the south-west of the river is the king's
palace, close to a tank. Within this are two or three hundred houses.
Seven or eight persons wait on the king, clothed in silk of various
colours.
</p>
<p>
"The king's palace is built of bricks. In height the wall is thirty feet.
Its circumference is about 30,000 paces. The hair on the king's head
is in appearance like growing grass; he wears a cap ornamented at top
with gold fashioned like leaves. A piece of silk is wrapped over his
bosom; round his waist he has a piece of embroidered silk; he wears a
short weapon; his feet are bare. Sometimes he rides on an elephant,
and sometimes on a bullock.
</p>
<p>
"With respect to the people, the hair of the men has the appearance
of growing grass. The women tie it in a knot at the top of the head;
they wear a coat and a long cloth. The men invariably wear a short
weapon at the waist, which is of exquisite workmanship.
</p>
<p>
"Their laws never punish by corporal infliction. They take no account
of the measure of a man's offences; the criminal, in all cases, is secured
with rattans, and then put to death by stabbing him.
</p>
<p>
"In their traffic they use the money of China, but of a coinage older
than the present times. These coins bear a value double of what they
do in China.
</p>
<p>
"The inhabitants of the country have names, but no surnames. They
are of a quarrelsome disposition. In their persons they are ill-favoured
and filthy. Their colour is a blueish black. Their heads are like those
of large monkeys, and they go bare-legged. They believe in evil spirits.
In sitting and sleeping they neither use chairs nor beds: in eating they
use neither spoons nor <em>chop-sticks</em>. With respect to food, they do not
reject snakes, caterpillars, worms, and insects. They do not scruple to
eat and sleep with their dogs.
</p>
<p>
"In their marriage ceremonies it is the practice for the man to go to
the house of the woman, where he stays five days; at the end of this time
the bride is received with music and noise at the house of the bridegroom.
The bride wears no coat, her hair is loose, her feet are bare,
and she wears a piece of silk round her bosom. Sometimes she wears
ornaments of gold, pearls, and precious stones.
</p>
<p>
"With respect to the dead, some are thrown into the water, some
burnt, and some buried; all this according to the will of the person
expressed before his death. The exports of the country are gold, silver,
pearls, rhinoceros' horns, elephants' teeth, tortoise-shell, beetle-nut,
black pepper, sapan wood, garu wood, kanglong, cotton, Sundit birds,
green pigeons, and doves of various colours, parrots of various colours,
red, green, and white, with white deer and white monkeys."</p></div>

<em>Gunung Perahiáng</em>, where the chief is called <em>Girang Pohon</em>, there are twelve
families; at <em>Gunung Párangkujang</em>, where the chief's name is <em>Wanklang</em>,
there are forty men and women; and at <em>Gunang Bungbang</em>, where the chief
is called <em>Kiang</em>, there are twelve families. In the <em>Rawayans</em>, the name
given to the place in which they respectively reside, this exact number is
constantly preserved, by the removal of any increase that may occur, and
by supplying any deficiency from those without who have not embraced
the Mahomedan faith.
</p>
<p>
The history of these people, who consider themselves as descendants of
<em>Prabu Seda</em>, the last chief of <em>Pajajaran</em>, is intimately connected with the
period of which we are now treating, and with the establishment of Mahomedanism
in the western districts. The origin of the <em>Bedui</em> is thus related:​&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"During the reign of <em>Prabu Seda</em>, the last prince of <em>Pajajaran</em>, he was
informed that a certain recluse, named <em>Seda Sakti</em>, had an incestuous intercourse
with his sister, and determined to punish him for thus bringing
disgrace upon the country; the man pleaded his innocence to no
purpose, and was put to death by being pressed between two large logs
of wood, previously making a stipulation, which was deemed reasonable
enough, and which obtained the concurrence of all present, <em>viz.</em> that if
he had actually been guilty of the crime laid to his charge, his descendants
might lose their religion and live in the low lands; if not, that <em>Prabu
Seda</em>, with his nobles and court, might lose their religion and place of residence,
and become for ever slaves: and as a sign that this stipulation
was approved and ratified from on high, immediately the sun was eclipsed,
the rain descended in torrents, the thunder roared, the earth shook,
and under the mountains were heard sounds like the discharge of great
guns.
</p>
<p>
"<em>Pachukaman</em>, son of <em>Prabu Seda</em>, who resided with his people at <em>Gunung
Pulusari</em>, at the period when the Mahomedan religion was about to be
introduced, apprehended the consequences of the stipulation made with
<em>Seda Sakti</em>, and determining not to change his ancient faith on any account,
he quitted the place in secret, leaving his people, of whom eight
hundred, who were holy men, went in search of him in vain, and only
returned to deplore his loss."
</p>
<p>
<em>Hasen-u-din</em> subsequently fell in with these eight hundred <em>recluses</em> and
converted them. He afterwards invaded <em>Pajajaran</em>. On his return to
<em>Pulusari</em>, he was accustomed to come down to <em>Sirang</em> twice in seven days to
sell fruit, and in the course of time he became acquainted with every thing
relative to the people of Bantam. He afterwards subdued <em>Girang</em>, the
ancient capital, situated a few miles inland of <em>Sirang</em>, of which the ruins
are still visible, more by means of conversion than by arms, and when
firmly established, <em>Prabu Seda</em> and his children, who refused to become
converts, were there put to the sword.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Bedui</em> are the descendants of those who on the fall of <em>Pajajaran</em>
escaped into the woods, and who refused to change their religion, remaining
firmly attached to that of <em>Prabu Seda</em>. There is a tomb of one of them
which they hold sacred, and which they will not allow any one but themselves
to approach, even to this day. In after times, when the <em>Bedui</em> submitted
to the Sultan of Bantam, and shewed no disposition to oppose the
Mahomedans, they were exempted from the necessity of becoming converts,
upon the condition, at the time they yielded, that the number in each
<em>Rawayan</em> allowed to profess the ancient worship should be limited<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.
</p>
<p>
When the Mahomedan religion became more generally established, it
was declared that all those people who should not have embraced the faith
before a certain day, should, with their descendants, be considered as outcasts
or slaves. This is the origin of the people termed <em>Abdi</em>, and who
are quite distinct from the <em>Bedui</em>.
</p>
<p>
The name, however, given in the <em>Sunda</em> traditions to the last chief of
<em>Pajajaran</em>, is <em>Sila Wangi</em>; and it is from some of his original adherents,
who became converts to Mahomedanism, that the present regents of the
<em>Sunda</em> districts are descended. One of them, <em>Guru Gantang'an</em>, with many
followers, is said to have retired to the forests on the mountain <em>Gedé</em>,
since called <em>Recha Domas</em> (eight hundred images), where many rude idols
are still to be found. There it is said they afterwards became extinct, and
according to the notion of the <em>Sundas</em>, the term <em>Per-hiang'an</em>, still retained
by the descendants from <em>Nga-hiang</em>, signifying annihilated, is derived from
the fate of this people.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>History of Java, from the Establishment of Mahomedanism</em> (A.J. 1400), <em>till
the Arrival of the British Forces in A.D. 1811.</em> (A.J. 1738).</p></div>


<p>About a year after the establishment of the chief authority
at <em>Demák</em>, the Sultan, accompanied by the different heads of
the Mahomedan worship, visited <em>Sheik Mulána Ibrahim</em> at
<em>Chéribon</em>. On this occasion, the chiefs were distributed over
different quarters appropriated for them, in the vicinity of
<em>Palimánan</em>, and the places where they resided still bear their
respective names.</p>

<p><em>Kábu Kanigára</em>, the chief of <em>Pájang</em>, second son of
<em>Andáya Níngrat</em> by one of the daughters of <em>Browijáya</em> and
the princess of <em>Chámpa</em>, was put to death, although he had
embraced the Mahomedan religion, for refusing to acknowledge
the supremacy of Sultan <em>Demák</em>, by presenting himself
at court when required. The following is the account of this
transaction, as given by the native writers.</p>

<p>"The <em>Pangéran Kúdus</em> then departed alone, and having
entered the <em>dálam</em> was observed by a female attendant of
the chief, who demanded his name and errand; to which
he replied, that he should have the honour to make himself
known to her master. The female observed that the prince
was ill, and in mourning for the death of one of his best
friends, <em>Kiái Gédé Tingkir</em>. <em>Pangéran Kúdus</em> then desired
her to tell her master that he was a messenger from
the Almighty, who brought good tidings. Having thus
obtained admittance to the chief, he informed him that he
was commissioned to require his immediate attendance
at <em>Demák</em>, and in case of refusal to put him to death. But
<em>Kábu Kanigára</em> still persisted in his refusal, and delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1148" id="Page_1148">[Vol II Pg 148]</a></span>
his <em>kris</em> into the hands of the <em>Pangéran</em>, who immediately
wounded him in the arm, of which he shortly expired. He
had however previously stipulated, that as his wife was
pregnant, the circumstances of his death should be kept
secret from her, and that her life should be preserved. The
widow shortly after quitted the <em>dálam</em>, and found an
asylum with the widow of <em>Kiái Gédé Tingkir</em>, where she
was delivered of a son, destined to perform a conspicuous
part in the transactions of those days."</p>

<p><em>Panambáhan Jimbua</em> reigned according to some twelve,
and according to others nine years after the fall of <em>Majapáhit</em>.
He had several children, one of whom, named <em>Pangéran
Sábrang Lor</em>, succeeded him as sultan of <em>Demák</em>: another,
named <em>Niái Bintára</em>, was married to <em>Mulána Ibrahim</em> of
<em>Chéribon</em>, who was in consequence honoured with the title of
<em>Panambáhan Makdum Játi</em>.</p>

<p><em>Panambáhan Jimbun</em> is represented as having resided in a
small unadorned dwelling, while the principal buildings at
<em>Demák</em> were constructed by <em>Pangéran Kúdus</em>, who had married
the daughter of <em>Húsen</em>, and being entrusted with the
highest offices, was considered as the second person in the
state.</p>

<p><em>Pangéran Sábrang Lor</em>, who succeeded his father in 1409,
after a reign of less than two years, died of an inflammation
of the lungs, and was succeeded, in 1412, by his brother,
named <em>Pangéran Tranggána</em>, the third sultan of <em>Demák</em>.</p>

<p>On the inauguration of <em>Pangéran Tranggána</em>, he received
the benediction of <em>Panambáhan Mákdum Játi</em>, and <em>Pangéran
Kúdus</em> was appointed high priest. Two <em>krises</em> and a
<em>bádi bádi</em> were made by the celebrated smith named <em>Súra</em>,
from the iron wand which was supposed to have wrought
miracles in the <em>Majapáhit</em> war. One of them was presented
to the new sultan, and became a royal <em>pusáka</em>; the other was
delivered to the <em>Pangéran</em> of <em>Kúdus</em>, with the appointment
of <em>Susúnan Pangúhu</em>, or high priest. The <em>bádi bádi</em> was
sent to <em>Súnan Bónang</em>.</p>

<p>Before the year 1421, the whole island of Java had submitted
to the authority of <em>Pangéran Tranggána</em>, the chiefs of
the several provinces, from <em>Bantam</em> to <em>Balambángan</em>, presenting
themselves at his court, and universal tranquillity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1149" id="Page_1149">[Vol II Pg 149]</a></span>
restored. The Mahomedan religion was now firmly established
throughout the island: the mosque was completed,
and treaties of amity and peace were concluded with the
princes of Borneo, <em>Palémbang</em>, <em>Báli</em>, <em>Singapúra</em>, <em>Indragírí</em>,
and other states of the Archipelago, which had become independent
of Javan authority after the fall of <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>This prince is represented to have been an intelligent,
good, and virtuous man, and to have enforced the strictest
obedience to the laws. Under his superintendence was composed
a work, entitled <em>Jáya Langkára</em>, in which the principles
of the Mahomedan law and precepts were blended with the
ancient instructions of the country, and thus rendered
agreeable to the people.</p>

<p>It is related, that on the occasion of the assemblage of the
different chiefs at the funeral of the deceased Sultan, and the
inauguration of <em>Bangéran Tranggánaa</em>, a dreadful storm
arose, with much thunder and lightning, when a youth,
named <em>Jáka Siséla</em> (the son of <em>Browijáya</em> by <em>Búdan Kajáwan</em>,
who had been delivered over to the superintendent of
his <em>sáwah</em> or rice fields) going out of the mosque to observe
the weather, saw a meteoric stone fall on the ground beside
him, without doing him harm. This stone he carried to the
<em>Súnan Kali Jága</em>, who declared it to be an omen prophetic
of much good to the youth. After thanks were returned to
the Almighty for having averted the danger from the mosque,
a sketch was made of the stone, which is still exhibited on
the door facing the north. This youth <em>Siséla</em> failing in an
endeavour to become chief of the sultan's guards, and afterwards
in an attempt upon the prince's life, was obliged to fly
from the capital.</p>

<p>It is necessary here to advert to <em>Jáka Tingkír</em>, the offspring
of <em>Kábu Kanigára</em>, a chief who had been put to death by
order of the first sultan of <em>Demák</em>. It having been foretold
that he would one day become sovereign of Java, he was
taken by his mother to <em>Demák</em> in his eleventh year, where he
soon found means to ingratiate himself with the Sultan, who
gave him the name of <em>Pánji Mas</em>, and caused him to be
instructed in the Mahomedan religion and in the precepts of
<em>Jáya Langkára</em>, appointed him to the command of the body
guard consisting of eight hundred men, and afterwards, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1150" id="Page_1150">[Vol II Pg 150]</a></span>
year 1449, gave him his daughter in marriage, with the administration
of the province of <em>Pájang</em>, where, with the permission
of the Sultan, he built a <em>kráton</em>; but afterwards having
put to death a person who had arrived from the <em>Kedú</em>,
applying for an appointment in the body guard, he was
banished to the forests. During his exile he visited a village
named <em>Bányu-bíru</em>, near the <em>Solo</em> river, where he was instructed
by a <em>Pandíta</em> how to conduct himself for the future,
the holy man predicting, at the same time, that he would become
sovereign of Java and hold his court at <em>Pájang</em>.</p>

<p>Several exploits against alligators are recorded of him;
and the opinion that no descendant of the princes of <em>Pájang</em>
need fear injury from these animals is so prevalent, that it is
not unusual for a Javan of the present day, seeing himself in
danger from one of them, to exclaim aloud that he belongs to
that family.</p>

<p>Not long after the return of <em>Pánji Mas</em>, the island of Java
was again formed into two separate and independent governments,
corresponding with the former limits of <em>Majapáhit</em>
and <em>Pajajaran</em>. The eastern provinces remained subject to
the Sultan of <em>Demák</em>, and the western were ceded in perpetuity
to <em>Mulána Ibrahim</em>, with the title of Sultan. To both
sultans was reserved the right of dividing their lands on their
demise among their children, as they might think proper.
The <em>Súnan Káli Jága</em> obtained as an hereditary property,
free from all kinds of requisitions, the small district of
<em>Adilángu</em>, in the province of <em>Demák</em>, where he was afterwards
buried.</p>

<p>From this period until the death of the Sultan of <em>Demák</em>,
the eastern provinces enjoyed the most undisturbed tranquillity;
but the Sultan of <em>Chéribon</em> found some difficulty in
establishing his authority over the western people, and in
converting them, particularly those of Bantam, to the Mahomedan
faith.</p>

<p>The Sultan of <em>Demák</em>, besides several natural children,
had two sons and four daughters. Of these daughters one
was married to a Madurese prince, who resided at <em>Lampung</em>;
another, <em>Balíga</em>, to a son of the Sultan of <em>Chéribon</em>, who was
the chief of <em>Bantám</em>; a third to <em>Ráden Pánji</em>, who after the
return of the Sultan from <em>Chéribon</em> was appointed chief of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1151" id="Page_1151">[Vol II Pg 151]</a></span>
<em>Pájang péng'ging</em>; and the fourth to the son of <em>Pángéran
Kedíri</em>, who was chief of <em>Japára</em>.</p>

<p><em>Pangéran Tranggána</em>, the third Sultan of <em>Demák</em>, died in
the year 1461, having previously made a division of his
dominions among his children.</p>

<p>His eldest son, <em>Aria Ráng'ga</em>, was appointed Sultan of
<em>Prawáta</em>, to which was annexed all the land to the eastward
along the Solo river, as far as <em>Surabáya</em>, together with
<em>Demák</em> and <em>Semárang</em>. His son-in-law, <em>Pangéran Hadíri</em>,
was made <em>Súnan</em> of the <em>Kali Niámat</em>, and possessed all the
districts of <em>Japári</em>, <em>Páti</em>, <em>Rémbang</em>, and <em>Jawána</em>. The
<em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Pájang Péng'ging</em> (<em>Ráden Pánji</em>) received the
title of <em>Brébo Páti</em> of <em>Pajang</em> and of <em>Matárem</em>, with the
lands attached to it. His son, <em>Mas Timor</em>, was appointed
<em>Adipátí</em>, with the lands of <em>Kedú</em> and <em>Bágalen</em>. His son-in-law,
the prince of <em>Madúra</em>, was made chief of <em>Madúra</em>,
<em>Suménap</em>, <em>Sedáyu</em>, <em>Grésik</em>, <em>Surabáya</em>, and <em>Pasúruan</em>. His
youngest son, <em>Ráden Panángsang</em>, was appointed chief of
<em>Jípang</em>.</p>

<p>The Sultan of <em>Chéribon</em>, better known by the name of
<em>Súnan Gúnung Játi</em>, died in 1428, at an advanced age,
leaving three sons by his wife, the princess of <em>Demák</em>, and
one son and a daughter by a concubine. His eldest son,
<em>Hásen</em>, succeeded him as Sultan of <em>Chéribon</em> and of the
provinces lying between the <em>Chi-tárum</em> river and <em>Túgu</em>, and
stretching in a southern direction to the <em>Kéndang</em> hills, so as
to include all the <em>Priáng'en</em> districts and lands lying to the
east of the <em>Chi-tárum</em>. From this prince are descended the
present Sultans of <em>Chéribon</em>. To his second son, <em>Baradin</em>,
he left the kingdom of <em>Bantam</em>, which extended westward
from the river of <em>Táng'ran</em>, to the south-east part of Sumátra,
including all the islands in the straits of <em>Súnda</em>. From him
are descended the present kings of <em>Bantam</em>. His third son,
named <em>Chenámpui</em>, died when young, and was buried at
<em>Mándu</em> in <em>Chéribon</em>. To his natural son, <em>Káli Játan</em>, he
assigned the lands lying between the <em>Chitárem</em> and <em>Tang'ran</em>
rivers, which had formerly formed part of <em>Chéribon</em> and
<em>Bantam</em>. This prince assumed the title of <em>Raja</em> of <em>Jokárta</em>
or <em>Jákatra</em>, fixing his capital near the <em>kámpung</em> of that name,
where he and his descendants continued to reign, until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1152" id="Page_1152">[Vol II Pg 152]</a></span>
were expelled, in the year 1619 of the Christian era, by the
Dutch, who established on its ruins the modern Batavia, the
capital of their possessions in the East Indies.</p>

<p>The tomb of the <em>Susúnan Gúnung Játi</em>, situated on the
mount so called, at a short distance from the present town
of <em>Chéribon</em>, is still an object of the highest veneration and
respect.</p>

<p>Thus was the ancient empire of Java divided under no less
than eight separate and independent governments. <em>Bantam</em>,
<em>Jokárta</em>, <em>Chéribon</em>, <em>Prawáta</em>, <em>Kaliniámat</em>, <em>Pajang Kedú</em>, and
<em>Madúra</em>; the several chiefs of which, in general, either
assumed the title of <em>Kiái Gédé</em> or Sultan, or the more religious
distinction of <em>Súnan</em>.</p>

<p>In about a year after the death of the Sultan <em>Tranggána</em>,
the country of <em>Pájang</em> rose to considerable importance; its
chief, on account of his possessing the regalia of state, being
considered as the first in rank of the several princes in the
eastern districts. Hatred, envy, and ambition, however, soon
inflamed the breasts of the different princes of Java. The
most ambitious among them, and the first who disturbed the
peace of the country, was the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Jípang, Ráden
Panángang</em>. The history proceeds thus:</p>

<p>"The <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Jípang</em>, by the advice of <em>Súnan Kúdus</em>,
dispatched one of his body guard, named <em>Rákut</em>, to Sultan
<em>Prawáta</em>, with orders to watch an opportunity and assassinate
him. On the arrival of <em>Rákut</em>, it happened that the
Sultan was labouring under an indisposition; but when he
was sufficiently recovered, he went one evening after
prayers, and sat down at the second gate of the <em>dálam</em>, his
wife standing behind and holding his head, accompanied
only by some female attendants. At that moment, <em>Rákut</em>
went up to him, and declared his commission; to which
the Sultan replied, 'I am aware that my time is come;
execute your orders, but do not hurt any one but me.'
Upon this, <em>Rákut</em> drew his <em>kris</em> and stabbed him; after
which, retreating a few steps, it occurred to him that the
chief might not be actually dead; and returning with an
intention of completing his purpose, he missed his aim,
and struck the wife. The prince observing this, immediately
threw his <em>kris</em> at the assassin, which, striking him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1153" id="Page_1153">[Vol II Pg 153]</a></span>
in the leg, threw him on the ground, where he was soon
dispatched by the people, who were assembled by the cries
of the women."</p>

<p>The prince and his wife soon after died of their wounds, and
left their dominions and property to their brother, the <em>Súnan
Káli Niámat</em>, with authority to administer the same until
their son, <em>Aria Pangíri</em>, should come of age. Both the prince
and his wife were interred in the burial place of their ancestors
at <em>Demák</em>; and the provinces of <em>Prawáta</em> thus became incorporated
with those of <em>Káli Niámat</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Súnan Káli Niámat</em> immediately went to <em>Kúdus</em>, and
demanded that justice and condign punishment should be inflicted
on the persons concerned in this murder; and the
<em>Súnan Kúdus</em>, expressing great indignation at the act, promised
compliance; but the <em>Sunan</em>, while returning to <em>Káli
Niámat</em>, was murdered on the road by persons in the pay of
the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Jípang</em>. This prince, having thus far succeeded
in his designs, then plotted the death of the chief of <em>Pájang</em>,
hoping by that means to remove the only obstacle to his obtaining
the supreme authority in the eastern districts of Java.
The assassins, however, whom he employed for this latter purpose
were not equally successful. They found the prince at
midnight in an inner apartment, sleeping among his wives:
but while approaching him to execute their design, one of them
happened to tread upon a woman, whose shriek awoke the
prince. He demanded the reason of their visit, and promised
them pardon, on their confessing by whom they were employed:
they disclosed the whole, and obtained pardon with
their dismissal. Thus disappointed in his scheme, the <em>Súnan
Kúdus</em> invited the chief <em>Patéh</em> of <em>Pájang</em> to visit <em>Kúdus</em>, and
assembled as many religious people as possible, in the hope
that an opportunity might be afforded of assassinating him
when off his guard; but a letter arriving at this period from
the Sultan of <em>Chéribon</em>, upon whose protection the widow of
the <em>Súnan Káli Niámat</em> had thrown herself, in which the Sultan
declared that he should hold the <em>Súnan Kúdus</em> responsible
for the discovery of the murderers, the intended assassination
was deferred.</p>

<p>The chief of <em>Pájang</em> having communicated with his sister,
the widow of <em>Súnan Káli Niámat</em>, who had made a vow never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1154" id="Page_1154">[Vol II Pg 154]</a></span>
to rest or to leave her home until the death of her husband,
brother, and sister, should be avenged, informed his <em>Panambáhan</em>,
that if they could find a suitable opportunity to take
revenge on <em>Ráden Penánsang</em>, they had his full consent. The
meeting which took place between the parties is thus described.</p>

<p>"After having laid the troops in ambush, the chiefs of <em>Pájang</em>
crossed the river, and seizing one of the grass-cutters
belonging to <em>Ráden Penánsang</em> they cut off a piece of
his right ear, and told him to go to his master with a letter,
which they hung about his neck, containing a challenge
from the prince of <em>Pájang</em>; they then returned to their own
camp. In the meanwhile the grass-cutter running with a
great noise to the quarters of <em>Ráden Penánsang</em>, who happened
to be at dinner, delivered the message.</p>

<p>"At this summons the <em>Ráden</em> came forth in a great rage,
and ordering his horse and spear, galloped down to the
river side, and called upon the prince to come over to him;
but the chief of <em>Pájang</em> answered, that if he was the man
of courage he pretended to be, he would himself cross to the
side he occupied. The <em>Ráden</em>, accompanied by two <em>Panakawans</em>
only, then crossed the river, and inquiring for his
opponent, was informed that he remained in his <em>póndok</em>,
and had sent his son to fight in his room, and would only appear
in the event of his being conquered. <em>Ráden Penánsang</em>
then said with a contemptuous smile, 'Is the <em>Brébo
Patéh</em> afraid, that he sends me a child with whom he knows
I will not fight? I will teach him something. Go, child,
and call your father.' He then amused himself galloping
about, until one of the chiefs of <em>Pájang</em> let loose a number of
mares, on which his horse became unmanageable, and he was
thrown, and killed on the spot. <em>Túmung'gung Matáok</em>, his
principal chief, now crossed the river with all his followers;
but they were soon overpowered, and the <em>Tumúng'gung</em> being
slain, his head was stuck upon a pole by the river side."</p>

<p>From this period the provinces of <em>Jípang</em> became subject to
the chief of <em>Pájang</em>; and his sister at <em>Kali Niamat</em>, being informed
of this success by <em>Panambáhan</em> expressed her readiness
to fulfil a promise which she had made, of conferring
upon him all her lands and property, <em>Panambáhan</em> declined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1155" id="Page_1155">[Vol II Pg 155]</a></span>
accepting this offer, alleging that he had only obeyed the orders
of his sovereign. He however received from her, on this
occasion, two <em>pusáka</em> rings, in one of which was set a large
diamond, in the other a ruby, which had formerly belonged to
the house of <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>The spoil taken in the war was then divided according to
usage, and to <em>Panambáhan</em> was assigned a population of eighteen
hundred working men in the district of <em>Mentáuk</em>, afterwards
called <em>Matárem</em>. The lands of <em>Káli Niámat</em> were left
in the possession of his sister, and those of <em>Demák</em> restored to
his nephew. <em>Aria Pangiri</em> received the title of Sultan of
<em>Demák</em>.</p>

<p>The province of <em>Mentáuk</em> or <em>Matárem</em>, at that period did
not contain more than three hundred villages, scattered in different
parts of the country. On the arrival of <em>Panambáhan</em>
near <em>Brambánan</em>, he was received by the <em>Súnan Adi Jága</em>, who
would not allow him to perform the usual ceremony of kissing
his feet, thus by implication predicting the future greatness of
his descendants. At <em>Páser Gédé</em>, then a wilderness, <em>Panambáhan</em>
was duly installed, under the title of <em>Kiái Gédé
Matárem</em>.</p>

<p>When the government of <em>Kiái Gédé Matárem</em> was fully established,
he was desirous of obtaining his son from the prince
<em>Pájang</em>, who had retained him as an adopted child, and feared
to part with him, in consequence of the prophecy of which he
was aware, predicting the future greatness of the descendants
of <em>Jáka Sisíla</em>; but on the entreaties of the <em>Súnan Káli Jaga</em>,
he consented to part with him, under a stipulation, upon oath,
from <em>Panambáhan</em>, that he would not undertake any thing
prejudicial to him during his lifetime.</p>

<p>In the year 1490, the chief of <em>Pájang</em>, from religious motives,
paid a visit to <em>Súnan Gíri</em>, accompanied by <em>Kiái Gédé
Matárem</em>, and a numerous retinue of chiefs and priests. He
was mounted on an elephant, and assumed all the pomp which
had been customary with the sultans of <em>Bintára</em>. On this occasion
he was formally installed as sultan, in the presence of
the chiefs of the eastern provinces. The <em>Súnan Gíri</em>, at the
same time, noticing <em>Kiái Gédé Matárem</em>, and being informed
of his descent, declared that his family would one day rule all
Java, and urged the Sultan of <em>Pájang</em> to protect and befriend
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1156" id="Page_1156">[Vol II Pg 156]</a></span>
It was during this visit that the Sultan of <em>Pájang</em> gave orders
for digging the extensive fish-ponds which are now preserved
at <em>Grésik</em> for the <em>Ikan Bándang</em>.</p>

<p>On the return of <em>Kiái Gédé Matárem</em> to his capital, he
called together his relations, and recommended to their kindness
the forty friends who had accompanied him on his first
coming to <em>Matárem</em>, and their descendants, enjoining them,
on no account whatever, to shed their blood, whatever crime
they might commit, but if necessary, to punish them in some
other way. To this they most solemnly bound themselves;
and from this period, strangling is said to have been introduced
as a capital punishment among the Javans.</p>

<p>His son, now called <em>Mas Anghebái Súta Wijáya</em>, had an
amour with the grand-daughter of <em>Sheik Wáli ben Húsen</em>,
who was intended to become one of the concubines of Sultan
<em>Pájang</em>. Upon her becoming pregnant, he fled first to <em>Chéribon</em>,
where he implored protection from the Sultan, but to
no purpose, and afterwards towards <em>Luánu</em>, where collecting
the rabble of the country, he commenced hostilities against
the chief. The Sultan of <em>Pájang</em>, however, at length offering
him a pardon, on condition of his marrying the girl, he returned,
and was again received into favour; but not before he
had reduced the chief of <em>Luánu</em> to submission, and rendered
that province tributary to <em>Matárem</em>.</p>

<p>The chiefs of <em>Surabáya</em>, <em>Grésik</em>, <em>Sidáyu</em>, <em>Túban</em>, <em>Wirasába</em>,
<em>Pranarága</em>, <em>Kedíri</em>, <em>Mádion</em>, <em>Blóra</em>, <em>Jípang</em>, and <em>Pasurúan</em>,
declared themselves independent of the prince of <em>Madúra</em>,
and elected <em>Pánji Wíría Kráma</em>, the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Surabáya</em>,
who acted as <em>Widána</em> to Sultan <em>Pájang</em>, to be their chief.
About the same time, <em>Sánta Gúná</em>, the chief of east <em>Balambángan</em>,
with the assistance of auxiliaries from <em>Báli</em> and Celebes,
again reduced the western districts of that province
under his authority, subduing the principality of <em>Panarúkan</em>
and expelling the prince and his followers.</p>

<p><em>Kiái Gédé Matárem</em> died in the year 1497, after having,
by his mild and equitable administration, converted the province
of <em>Matárem</em>, from a wilderness into a fertile and populous
country, and induced many of the surrounding districts
voluntarily to submit to his authority.</p>

<p>The relations of the deceased appearing at the court of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1157" id="Page_1157">[Vol II Pg 157]</a></span>
Sultan of <em>Pájang</em>, he appointed his son, <em>Anghebái Súta Wijáya</em>,
to succeed him as chief of <em>Matárem</em>, conferring upon
him, at the same time, the command of all the troops of the
empire, under the title of <em>Kiái Gédé Agung Senapáti Ingalága</em>,
commonly distinguished by the single title of <em>Senapáti</em>,
enjoining him annually to present himself at his court on the
feast of <em>Múlut</em>.</p>

<p>It is noticed, that at this period the island was frequented
by Portuguese and other European navigators, who had established
factories at Bantam.</p>

<p>The ambition of the court of <em>Matárem</em> being kept alive by
various predictions, dreams, and enchantments, by which <em>Senapàti</em>
was promised the assistance of <em>Kiái Gédé Laut Kidúl</em>
the goddess of the great South Sea, who declared herself
wedded to him, he was instigated to build an extensive <em>kráton</em>
on the spot where his <em>dálam</em> then stood.</p>

<p>He now placed guards at the limits of his territories, burnt
some of the adjacent villages, and assumed an attitude of
complete independence, subjecting by degrees many of the
neighbouring districts. Ambassadors were immediately sent
from <em>Pájang</em> to demand an explanation. They were in the
first instance duped by the flattering manner in which they
were received; but afterwards discovering the real state of
affairs, and reporting it to the Sultan their master, he is represented
as having called his son before him, and having
said, "the will of Providence rules all events. <em>Senapáti</em> will
not, during my life, commence hostilities against me, but
after my death he will render you subject to him. Yield to
his power, on which depends your happiness and that of
your descendants." At length, however, the chiefs of <em>Túban</em>
and <em>Demák</em>, apprehensive of the growing power of <em>Matárem</em>,
prevailed upon him first to banish the <em>Tumung'gung
Pájang</em>, as the instigator of this feud, and afterwards to send
a considerable force against <em>Matárem</em>. The <em>Tumung'gung</em>,
however, was rescued by forty chosen men dispatched by <em>Senapáti</em>,
and a stratagem induced the forces of <em>Pájang</em> to retreat.
The <em>Pájang</em> forces consisted of five thousand men,
commanded by the Sultan's son: those of <em>Senapáti</em> did not
exceed eight hundred. The latter seeing that it was rash to
risk an engagement against such a superiority of numbers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1158" id="Page_1158">[Vol II Pg 158]</a></span>
particularly as the few troops he had raised on the emergency
were altogether unexperienced and undisciplined, while those
of <em>Pajáng</em> were in the highest order, halted at a short distance
from <em>Brambánan</em>, where the enemy's forces were encamped.
During the night he burned all the villages in the vicinity, and
set fire to the reeds and long grass at some distance from
<em>Brambánan</em>, and to the rear of the enemy's camp, by which
means he persuaded them that the <em>Matárem</em> forces had taken
their departure, in order to obtain <em>Pájang</em> by surprize.</p>

<p>During the succeeding night there was a heavy thunder
storm, and on the following morning the mountain <em>Merbábu</em>
burst with a dreadful explosion, throwing out ashes and large
stones; the rivers overflowed their banks and inundated the
low country, occasioning great confusion and destruction in
the <em>Pájang</em> camp, and inducing the commander to retreat
with his army forthwith to <em>Pájang</em>. Halting at the village
<em>Tumpáit</em>, situated near <em>Kárbu Súru</em>, he visited the tomb of
the <em>Pangéran</em> of that name, who was descended from <em>Abdálah</em>,
the eldest son of <em>Ráden Pátah</em>. Here the sultan is said
to have been informed of a prophecy which foretold the immediate
downfall of <em>Pájang</em>, and to have fainted and fallen
from his elephant in consequence.</p>

<p><em>Senapáti</em> immediately bent his course to <em>Pájang</em>, where
the sultan was again willing to receive him as his adopted
son, and to pardon his past conduct; but a youth in the retinue
of <em>Senapáti</em>, after first proposing to assassinate the sultan,
a proposition to which <em>Senapáti</em> refused to listen, at last
of his own accord succeeded in administering poison to him,
of which he died. This happened, however, after the return
of <em>Senapáti</em> to <em>Matárem</em>.</p>

<p>Being summoned by <em>Ráden Benáwa</em>, son of the deceased,
<em>Senapáti</em> immediately repaired to <em>Pájang</em>, where he found
already assembled <em>Pangéran Kúdus</em> and the principal chiefs
of the country, who after the funeral proceeded to the election
of a new sultan. <em>Senapáti</em> was for investing the son of the
deceased with the authority enjoyed by his father, but the
<em>Súnan Kúdus</em>, who though he had been the cause of his son's
death, still breathed vengeance against the <em>Pájang</em> family,
for the ignominious manner in which the punishment was
carried into effect, opposed this nomination, and favouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1159" id="Page_1159">[Vol II Pg 159]</a></span>
the pretensions of Sultan <em>Démak</em>, that chief was duly proclaimed
Sultan of <em>Pájang, Ráden Benáwa</em> being appointed
chief of <em>Jípang</em>. From this period the different states which
had acknowledged the supremacy of <em>Pájang</em> successively
broke off from their allegiance.</p>

<p>The new Sultan of <em>Pájang</em> commenced his career by removing
from office most of the <em>Pájang</em> chiefs, and replacing
them by his adherents from <em>Demák</em>, which occasioned a
general discontent. At last <em>Ráden Benáwa</em>, who was not inclined
quietly to submit to the loss of his kingdom, succeeded
in inducing <em>Senapáti</em> openly to adopt his cause, and join the
forces which he could himself send from <em>Jípang</em> and the discontents
of <em>Pájang</em>.</p>

<p><em>Senapáti</em> accordingly marched against <em>Pájang</em>, and an engagement
taking place, most of the troops deserted the sultan's
cause, and the remainder, who continued faithful, were
soon put to flight. <em>Ráden Benáwa</em>, alarmed at a dream, in
which he heard a voice saying, "Every thing in life has a
beginning and an end, all worldly greatness is vanity, and
no man can call himself happy until his death; do you
always bear this in mind:" withdrew, and having followed
the course of the <em>Sólo</em> river down to <em>Grésik</em>, proceeded thence
to <em>Kendál</em>, where he attracted many followers by his irreproachable
conduct. At last he settled on the mountain <em>Parákan</em>,
where he was buried.</p>

<p><em>Senapáti</em>, after this success, proceeded to carry the <em>kráton</em>
by assault, and having entered the front gateway, the wife of
the sultan came forth, entreating that her husband's life might
be spared; but <em>Senapáti</em> reminding her that he was the friend
of her father, and had nothing to fear, desired her instantly
to produce her husband, which being complied with, he informed
the sultan that the people of <em>Pájang</em> being displeased
with him he could no longer remain sovereign, but that he
and his followers might return to <em>Demák</em> as soon as they
pleased, the sovereignty being now conferred on <em>Ráden Benáwa</em>.</p>

<p>Search was made for <em>Ráden Benáwa</em> without effect, but
that chief was duly proclaimed as sultan, and the brother of
<em>Senapáti</em> appointed to administer the country until his arrival.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1160" id="Page_1160">[Vol II Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>The retreat of <em>Ráden Benáwa</em> being at length discovered,
and that chief declining to accept the government of <em>Pájang</em>,
his brother, <em>Pangéran Gája Búmi</em>, was appointed sultan in
his room. The latter shortly after died, and was succeeded
by the son of <em>Benáwa, Ráden Sidawíni</em>, on whom the title of
<em>Pangéran Pájang</em> was conferred.</p>

<p>As soon as order was again restored, <em>Senapáti</em> returned to
<em>Matárem</em>, carrying with him the saddle called <em>gatáya</em>, the
head-dress called <em>máchang gúguh</em>, and a set of <em>gámelan</em> called
<em>sekar dalíma</em>, which he had taken at the assault of <em>Pájang</em>, as
trophies of his victory, together with the cannon called <em>niái
stómi</em>, and all the insignia and ornaments of royalty, which
had descended for the most part from the princes of <em>Pajajáran</em>
and <em>Majapáhit</em>, and which are still preserved in the
regalia of the princes of Java.</p>

<p><em>Senapáti</em>, in consequence of these arrangements and the
possession of the regalia, transferred the seat of empire to
<em>Matárem</em>, and lost no time in raising his family to the highest
dignities. Assuming himself the title of sultan, he elevated
his nephews to the rank of <em>Pangérans</em>.</p>

<p>His ambitious views being now so far realized, he consulted
the <em>Súnan Gíri</em>, wishing to obtain his opinion, whether
the time for the complete fulfilment of the prophecy was not
arrived. The <em>Súnan</em> replied, that if the Sultan of <em>Matárem</em>
wished to be sovereign of the whole island of Java, it was
essential that he should, in the first instance, bring the eastern
provinces under subjection. In consequence of this reply, the
sultan immediately collected his troops, trained them to the
use of arms and regular discipline, and in the month of <em>mohárem</em>
marched eastward.</p>

<p>The <em>Adipáti of Surabáya</em>, who had held the supreme authority
over all the eastern districts, as <em>Widána</em> to the sultan
of <em>Pájang</em>, no sooner heard of these preparations, than he
directed all the subordinate chiefs with their forces to assemble
at <em>Jípang</em>, there to await the arrival of the army from
<em>Matárem</em>; but at the moment when a general engagement
was about to take place between the two armies, an open
letter was delivered to both chiefs from the <em>Súnan Gíri</em>, requesting
them to desist, and proposing an arrangement, by
which the eastern provinces were to become subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1161" id="Page_1161">[Vol II Pg 161]</a></span>
<em>Matárem</em>, but to continue under the immediate administration
of the <em>Adipáti</em>. This arrangement was agreed to by
both parties, but the <em>Adipati</em> soon repented of it, who in consequence
was preparing for hostilities, when an open rapture
was again averted by the interference of the <em>Súnan Gíri</em>;
but soon after being joined by the forces of <em>Pranarága</em> and
<em>Madion</em>, the <em>Adipáti</em> assembled his troops and marched to
invade <em>Matárem</em>.</p>

<p><em>Senapáti</em> no sooner heard of these hostile preparations, and
that the <em>Adipáti</em> was levying the revenue of <em>Pájang</em>, than
accompanied by his uncle, <em>Kiái Gédé Páti</em>, he marched
towards <em>Madion</em>, and obtained possession of the <em>dálam</em>, the
chief having previously fled with his son to <em>Surabáya</em>, leaving
behind him a daughter whom <em>Senapáti</em> married. His uncle,
displeased at his conduct, returned to <em>Páti</em>; but <em>Senapáti</em>
prosecuted his march towards <em>Pasúruan</em>, with an intention to
render himself master of that province.</p>

<p>The chief of <em>Pasúruan</em> was inclined to surrender at discretion,
but was dissuaded from doing so by his <em>Páteh</em>. One
day when <em>Senapáti</em> accompanied by only forty men of his
body-guard, was reconnoitering the enemy's camp, he met
the <em>Páteh</em>, who had come out with a similar intention, when
a skirmish taking place, the <em>Páteh</em> was wounded by a lance
and fell to the ground. The sultan lifting him up and placing
him on a mare, sent him back to the chief, with a letter tied
round his neck. The chief no sooner saw him in this disgraceful
predicament, than he repented of having taken his
advice, and ordering his head to be immediately severed from
his body, sent it to <em>Senapáti</em> in token of submission.</p>

<p>After this <em>Senapáti</em> returned to <em>Matárem</em>, where he married
one of his daughters to the son of the late chief of <em>Madion</em>,
and appointed him chief of <em>Jipang</em>.</p>

<p><em>Súra Manggála</em>, a chief of <em>Kedíri</em>, was now willing to submit
to the authority of <em>Matárem</em>, but <em>Senapáti</em> returned no
other answer to his messenger, than that it was his intention
to march at the next <em>mohárem</em>, when it would be the duty of
<em>Súra Manggála</em> to surrender that province. Accordingly, in
the month of <em>mohárem</em>, an army proceeded against <em>Kedíri</em>:
the <em>Matárem</em> forces were successful, and the chief and his
three brothers submitted. <em>Senapáti</em> was so pleased with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1162" id="Page_1162">[Vol II Pg 162]</a></span>
conduct of <em>Súra Mang'gála</em> on this occasion, that he appointed
him to the command of the <em>Matárem</em> troops.</p>

<p>This chief, better known by the name of <em>Senapáti Bálek</em>,
served the sultan of <em>Matárem</em> with great ability and fidelity.
He gained numerous victories, brought all the western provinces,
as far as <em>Chéribon</em>, to acknowledge the supremacy of
<em>Matárem</em>, limiting the authority of that chief within the
rivers of <em>Losári</em> and <em>Indramáyu</em>. He is said to have removed
the mud wall which surrounded the <em>kráton</em> of <em>Matárem</em>, and
built in its stead a strong wall of stone. He was at last
killed in a desperate engagement with the eastern people,
which took place in <em>Pájang</em>, in which however the <em>Matárem</em>
troops were successful.</p>

<p>Shortly after the death of this chief, <em>Senapáti</em> received intelligence
of hostile preparations against <em>Matárem</em> being made
by his uncle, <em>Kiái Gédé Páti</em>. He accordingly proceeded to
meet him, accompanied by all his sons and a numerous army.
After a long and a desperate action, the <em>Matárem</em> forces were
again successful, and the sultan returned to <em>Matárem</em>, with
the wives, children, and all the valuables of his uncle.</p>

<p>His son, <em>Pangéran Séda Krápiak</em>, being wounded on this
occasion, the sultan published a proclamation, declaring that
prince to be his successor after his death, by the title of <em>Panambahan
Senapáti</em>.</p>

<p>The continued opposition of the eastern people, however,
and the revolt of <em>Kedíri</em> and <em>Pasúruan</em>, obliged him again to
take the field, when finding the numbers and strength of the
enemy far superior to his own, he conducted an able but slow
retreat to his capital, and during the whole course of his reign
found it impracticable to subject these provinces to his authority.
To the provinces, however, of <em>Matárem</em>, <em>Bágelen</em>,
<em>Bányumas</em>, <em>Pájang</em> and <em>Jípang</em>, which descended to him
from his father, he added those of <em>Páti</em>, <em>Kúdus</em>, <em>Semáráng</em>,
<em>Kendál</em>, and <em>Kaliwúng'u</em>.</p>

<p>The days of <em>Sénapati</em>, the founder of the <em>Matárem</em> empire,
and of the dynasty which still retains a nominal rule on
Java, were now brought to a close, after a reign of continued
warfare. As the founder of the last native empire on Java,
his memory is naturally held in high estimation; but he is
also respected for the discipline he introduced into his army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1163" id="Page_1163">[Vol II Pg 163]</a></span>
and the valour, ability, and noble-mindedness which he displayed
throughout. With the Javans he is considered as
another Alexander, and he is the first in their modern history
who is considered to have understood the art of war.</p>

<p>He was succeeded, in the year 1524, by his son, since
called <em>Séda Krápiak</em>, from the place of his interment, but
who during his reign, bore the title of <em>Panambáhan Senapáti</em>.
The succession was, however, opposed by his elder brother,
<em>Pangéran Púger</em>, who did not attend to kiss the sovereign's
feet, as customary, on the day following his installation.
This chief proceeding to hostilities, was soon taken prisoner
near <em>Ungárang</em>. He was banished to <em>Kúdus</em>, and his minister
was put to death, which offended one of his younger brothers,
<em>Jajarága</em>, so much, that he instantly quitted <em>Matárem</em> and
proceeded to <em>Pranarága</em>, of which province he had formerly
been appointed chief, with an intention of stirring up a rebellion
in the distant provinces; but the sultan obtaining information
of it, secured his person and banished him also. He
was shortly afterwards pardoned and permitted to return.</p>

<p>It was during this reign that the Dutch and English first
visited Java.</p>

<p>This prince reduced the provinces of <em>Madion</em> and <em>Pranarága</em>,
and built a palace, the walls of which are still standing
at <em>Krapiak</em>, a place at the foot of a range of hills lying along
the South Sea, a short distance from <em>Matárem</em>. He died
after a reign of twelve years, esteemed on account of the
general tranquillity which prevailed after the firm establishment
of his government.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his eldest son, named <em>Panambáhan
Merta Púra</em>, in the year 1540; but this prince not being able
to conduct the government, on account of his infirm state of
health, or more probably removed by the intrigues of his
family, who declared him to be insane, made way for his
younger brother, who was raised to the throne in the following
year.</p>

<p>This prince, distinguished by the title of <em>Agung</em>, or the
great, commenced a flourishing reign by a signal victory over
the <em>Surabáyan</em> and <em>Madurese</em> forces, by which he brought
the eastern provinces of <em>Málang</em>, <em>Untung</em>, <em>Jápan</em>, <em>Wirasába</em>,
<em>Pasúruan</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>, under subjection; and following up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1164" id="Page_1164">[Vol II Pg 164]</a></span>
his success, subdued all the eastern provinces, as far as <em>Balambángan</em>.
Dissensions arising at this period between the
people of Bantam and those of the <em>Súnda</em> districts, the chief
of <em>Súmedang</em> applied to <em>Matárem</em> for assistance; and being
invested by the sultan with the chief authority over those districts,
soon brought the whole of the western chiefs, alarmed
at the approach of <em>Matárem</em> arms, to acknowledge his supremacy.
A force was now sent to <em>Madúra</em>, and that island
being conquered was united to his dominion, which then extended
through all Java and Madúra. An enemy, more
powerful than any with whom he had been accustomed to
contend, and destined to strip his posterity of all but the semblance
of sovereignty, now appeared. The Dutch, availing
themselves of the divisions and convulsions by which the empire
had been previously distracted, had established themselves
at <em>Jákatra</em>.</p>

<p>On their first arrival at Bantam, the prince of that country
was absent on an expedition against <em>Palémbang</em>, which
country, as well as a great part of the north and west coast of
Sumatra, was then subject to his sway. They found the influence
of the Portuguese, who had previously established a
factory there, on the decline, and with little difficulty entered
into a treaty with the chief, on whom the administration of
the country was provisionally conferred during the absence of
the prince. By this treaty, the contracting parties agreed to
trade honestly and fairly with each other, and to afford mutual
assistance in case of being attacked by an enemy.</p>

<p>Complaints, however, were soon made of the high tone
which the Dutch assumed, and of the insolence of their menaces.
Hostilities ensued, and according to the Dutch account,
upwards of a hundred of the natives were killed or
wounded. The consequence was, that they were obliged to
quit Bantam. Touching at <em>Jákatra</em>, <em>Japára</em>, <em>Túban</em>, and
<em>Sidáyu</em>, they had an affair with the Madurese, but ill calculated
to make an impression in their favour. The prince of
that country, anxious to pay his respects to the Europeans,
requested, through his interpreter, to be permitted to visit the
principal person among them, and an arrangement was accordingly
made that he should be received on board a particular
ship. As the prince left the shore with his suite, accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1165" id="Page_1165">[Vol II Pg 165]</a></span>panied
by their women and children, the Hollanders became
alarmed at the appearance of so numerous an assemblage, and
observing that they did not appear to be proceeding direct to
the ship pointed out for their reception, discharged three guns.
The terror occasioned by the report threw the procession into
the utmost confusion, all the people in the boats falling as if
killed. The crews of the other European vessels taking these
guns as a signal for action, threw themselves with such impetuosity
upon the native boats, that out of this numerous
assemblage only twenty-one are said to have escaped. Among
the slain was the prince, and his interpreter or high priest,
and their bodies, as soon as discovered, were thrown with indignity
into the sea.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that the leading traits which distinguish
the subsequent administration of the Dutch on Java (a haughty
assumption of superiority, for the purpose of overawing the
credulous simplicity of the natives, and a most extraordinary
timidity, which led them to suspect treachery and danger, in
quarters where they were least to be apprehended) were manifested
in their earliest transactions in this quarter. On their
first arrival at Bantam, we find the clerks of their trading vessels
styling themselves captains; and such was the state and
consequence assumed by Houtman, the chief of the expedition,
who took the title of Captain Major, that a Portuguese,
who had known him before, asked him significantly if he had
been created <em>a duke</em> since he last saw him. The murder of
the unfortunate prince of <em>Madúra</em> and his followers (for it can
be called by no other term) was as detestable and unjustifiable
as the subsequent massacre of the unfortunate and unoffending
Chinese in the streets of Batavia. In neither case was
there a plea to palliate the crying guilt, but such a degree of
danger, as the basest cowardice could alone be sensible of.</p>

<p>This aggression did not pass unpunished, for the Dutch
Admiral having allowed some of his men to land near <em>Arosbáya</em>,
then the capital of the island, they were seized by the Madurese,
and their enlargement was not effected without the
loss of many lives and the payment of a liberal ransom.</p>

<p>Bantam was already a place of considerable trade: Chinese,
Arabs, Persians, Moors, Turks, Malabars, Peguans, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1166" id="Page_1166">[Vol II Pg 166]</a></span>
word, merchants from all nations were established there. The
principal produce for the European market was pepper. With
this province the Dutch renewed their commerce in the year
1598 A.D., and four years afterwards they obtained permission
to establish a factory there. In the following year, accordingly,
they erected a permanent building, and formed a
commercial establishment. At this time they had granted
passes to the vessels belonging to the chief of <em>Túban</em>; and, in
1609, they left an agent at <em>Grésik</em>. A second treaty was now
entered into with the king of Bantam, in which the States
General stipulated to assist him against foreign invaders, particularly
Spaniards and Portuguese; and the king on his side
agreed to make over to the Dutch a good and strong fort, a
free trade, and security for their persons and property, <em>without
paying any duties or taxes</em>, and to allow no other European
nation to trade or reside in his territories. The Dutch
observing the serious differences which occurred among the
chiefs of Bantam during the minority of the sovereign, made
overtures, in the same year, to the prince of <em>Jákatra</em>, and removed
to that province soon after.</p>

<p>In 1612, a convention was entered into between them and
the prince of <em>Jákatra</em>, by which a free trade was allowed to
them, together with an eligible place to reside at; both parties
contracting to assist each other in war on the territory of
<em>Jákatra</em>. It was moreover stipulated, that all goods should
pay duty, except such as were imported in Dutch ships, or
Chinese junks; and that the prince should prohibit the
Spaniards and Portuguese from trading with his dominions.</p>

<p>On the 19th January, 1619, a further treaty was made with
the same prince, confirming the former contracts, and stipulating
that the fort should remain in its present state until the
arrival of the Governor General, and that the English should
be obliged to build their factory, and the other nations their
houses, at a certain distance from the fort; but on the 1st of
February following, in consequence of the success of the
English, who had espoused the cause of the native chiefs, we
find a convention entered into by the prince of <em>Jákatra</em>, the
commanding officer of the English, and the commandant of
the Dutch fort, by which the latter promised to deliver over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1167" id="Page_1167">[Vol II Pg 167]</a></span>
the fort to the English, and the treasure, merchandize, &amp;c. to
the prince: the English agreeing to furnish the Dutch garrison
with a ship and a safe conduct for six months.</p>

<p>On the 11th March, a contract was entered into between
the king of Bantam and the commissioners of the Dutch Company,
still in the fort of <em>Jákatra</em>, whereby the former promised
to protect the Dutch against all hostile attempts, and
to permit the re-establishment of a free trade on its former
footing. The Dutch, on their part, agreed to keep the fort in
good order, and to abandon the same on the arrival of their
ships, when they would also deliver to the king (in return for
the protection he afforded them) one-fourth of the Company's
property, and one-half of the ordnance, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In consequence, however, of the arrival of reinforcements
from Europe, under Koen, and of the political understanding
which then existed between the English and Dutch nations,
the Dutch still maintained their ground, and in the month of
August following laid the foundation of their establishment at
<em>Jákatra</em> on an extensive scale. They had previously, in the
years 1618 and 1619, plundered and laid in ashes the town of
<em>Japára</em>, because the chief of that province had, in the former
year, taken possession of the factory, made prisoners of the
Dutch, and sent them into the interior.</p>

<p>The Javan historians considering the Dutch in the light of
other foreign nations, who were in the habit of trading to the
sea coasts, do not furnish us with any information concerning
the disputes which took place at Bantam, or in the first
instance at <em>Jákatra</em>. Even in their accounts of the occasion
of the first hostilities which took place with the sultan of
<em>Matárem</em>, they convey rather a notion of what is the general
impression regarding the first establishment of the Dutch,
than any particulars calculated to throw light on the history
of that period. "The Dutch," say they, "before they
arrived at <em>Jákatra</em>, had formed an alliance with the sultan of
Bantam. They subsequently treated with the English, and
with <em>Pangéran Jokárta</em>; but in a short time they found the
way to play off a foul stratagem on the latter. In the first
place, when they wished to ascertain the strength and resources
of <em>Jákatra</em>, they landed like <em>máta-mátas</em> (peons or
messengers), the captain of the ship disguising himself with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1168" id="Page_1168">[Vol II Pg 168]</a></span>
turban, and accompanying several <em>Khójas</em> (a term by which
the natives of the Coromandel coast are distinguished).
When he had made his observations, he entered upon trade,
offering however much better terms than were just, and
making more presents than were necessary. A friendship
thus took place between him and the prince: when this
friendship was established, the captain informed the prince
that his ship wanted repair; and the prince, at his request,
allowed the vessel to be brought up the river. There the
captain knocked out the planks of the bottom and sunk the
vessel, to obtain a pretence for farther delay, and then requested
a very small piece of ground, on which he might
build a shed, to store the sails and other property, while
endeavours should be made to raise the vessel. This request
was also complied with. The captain then made a wall or
mound of mud, so that nobody could know what he was
doing, and in the mean time courted the friendship of the
prince. He afterwards waited on the prince, and requested
as much more land as could be covered by a buffalo's hide, on
which he might build a small <em>póndok</em>. This being complied
with, he cut the hide into strips, and claimed all the land he
could enclose with them. To this also the prince, after some
hesitation, consented. The captain then went on with his
buildings, engaging that he would pay all expenses. When
the fort was finished, the mud wall was removed; batteries
were unexpectedly displayed, and under their protection
the Dutch refused to pay a <em>doit</em>. War then commenced, in
which the Dutch were reduced to such an extremity, as to be
obliged to use stones in lieu of balls, which were expended.
Even this resource failed; and, as a last expedient, bags of
the filthiest ordure were fired upon the Javans, whence the
fort has ever since borne the name of <em>Kóta tái</em>."</p>

<p>Such is the aversion of the Javans for the <em>Khójas</em>, as well
on account of their general character as of their conduct on
this occasion, that it is a proverb among them, "If you meet
a snake and a <em>Khoja</em> in the same road, kill the <em>Khoja</em> first,
and afterwards the snake."</p>

<p>Another account is as follows. "The Dutch having obtained
the desired spot built on it a storehouse, and formed a
garden for vegetables. When <em>Pangéran Jokárta</em> inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1169" id="Page_1169">[Vol II Pg 169]</a></span>
why they did this, they replied, they must have their conveniences,
and that it was not the custom of the Dutch to live
and eat like the Javans. The <em>Pangéran</em> was satisfied with
the reason given, and allowed the work to proceed; but they
had no sooner completed several buildings, by means of the
people landed from their ships, than they began to surround
them with a battery. The <em>Pangéran</em> again was roused, and
inquired the reason of this, to which they replied, that there
were a great many traders about to arrive, and that it was
necessary to protect their property from thieves. When the
batteries were completed they planted cannon in them: the
<em>Pangéran</em> inquired the reason of this preparation, to which
they only replied, it was to keep off bad people.</p>

<p>"In a short time, however, when the Dutch had increased
in numbers, they fired one of the guns, and the ball discharged
from it fell in front of the <em>Pangéran's</em> palace. The
<em>Pangéran</em> inquired why they did so, to which they replied,
they were only trying how far the gun would carry, in order
that they might be able to assist the <em>Pangéran</em>, should he be
attacked by an enemy. The <em>Pangéran</em>, however, was not
satisfied with this reason, and demanded a fine of two
thousand dollars for the insult, which the Dutch immediately
paid. But it was not long before they fired another gun, the
ball of which went over the palace, on which the <em>Pangéran</em>
became highly incensed, and demanded a fine of four thousand
dollars, threatening if it was not paid forthwith, to write
to the sultan of <em>Matárem</em>, who would order them immediately
to be driven from the island. To this menace the Dutch said
nothing, but paid the money, which the <em>Pangéran</em> received
with delight. The Dutch, at last, fired a gun, the ball of which
fell within the palace, on which the <em>Pangéran</em> conceiving
it to be their intention to attack him, immediately considered
them as enemies, and collected his people, in order to fall
upon them and destroy them without delay. As soon as the
Dutch saw the people thus assembled, they fired from their
batteries, dealing slaughter all around, and obliged the <em>Pangéran</em>
and his people to retreat out of the reach of the shot."</p>

<p>While these events were in progress in the western provinces,
a serious revolt took place in the central and eastern
districts, in consequence of the intrigues of <em>Aria Mandúra</em>,
the favourite and chief minister of the sultan, who by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1170" id="Page_1170">[Vol II Pg 170]</a></span>
of his treacherous conduct to the chief of <em>Pájang</em>, had obtained
the administration of that province for himself. The
chiefs of <em>Madúra</em> and <em>Surabáya</em> availing themselves of the
disturbance thus occasioned at <em>Pájang</em>, declared their independence
of <em>Matárem</em>, and were not reduced to subjection
till two armies had been sent to the eastward against them.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, the chief of <em>Surabáya, Tumúnggung
Sapánjang</em>, having refused to give up two beautiful horses
which the sultan demanded of him, an army was sent to
compel his obedience; but the chief being reinforced from
<em>Madúra</em>, repulsed the <em>Matárem</em> forces, obliging them to
return to their capital.</p>

<p>The sultan, who had hitherto shown himself anxious to
maintain a good understanding with the Dutch, and consented
to their enjoying a free trade to the different parts of Java,
with permission to establish a factory at <em>Japára</em>, is represented
as having acted upon their advice in the present
juncture, in marching to the eastward in person with his
whole forces; but they no sooner saw him undertake the
expedition, than availing themselves of the opportunity, they
took possession of <em>Jákatra</em>.</p>

<p>He immediately sent two armies against them, under the
command of <em>Tumúnggung Wíra Kusúma</em>, and a battle ensued,
in which the Javan chief, with about ten thousand of his followers,
were either slain or drowned in the river <em>Chilúang</em>. <em>Tumúnggung
Náta Jawána</em> coming up afterwards, collected the
fugitives, and joining them with his forces surrounded the
town. He posted troops on all the roads towards the south
and west, at the distance of cannon-shot from the town, at the
same time cutting channels to lead off the streams by which
the Dutch were supplied. After an unsuccessful attack made
by the chiefs <em>Mandúra Réja</em> and <em>Wíla Tíkta</em>, for which they
were put to death by their commander, a sally was made on
the part of the besieged with so much success, that <em>Tumúnggung
Jawána</em> determined to break up with his army,
and no further attempt against the Dutch was made until the
year 1629, A.D.</p>

<p>"In this year a second army from <em>Matárem</em>, composed of
Javans and Madurese, appeared before Batavia. The siege
lasted for a considerable time, and the assaults on the town
and fort, as well as the sallies of the besieged, were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1171" id="Page_1171">[Vol II Pg 171]</a></span>
bloody. Anxious to know the fate of his army, the sultan
dispatched his uncle, <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em>, to Batavia, to
obtain information. This chief having destroyed the Dutch
factory at <em>Japára</em>, embarked in a swift sailing <em>práhu</em> of the
size of the trunk of the largest teak tree, which when seen at
a distance looked like a serpent on the sea. On reaching the
bay of Batavia, <em>Purbáya</em> perceived three ships at anchor.
Two of them, after firing upon him, were sunk, and notwithstanding
the fire from the third he brought his <em>práhu</em> safe up
to <em>Jákatra</em>, when he was fired upon from the fort. On this
<em>Purbáya</em> with three followers landed from the <em>práhu</em>, and
passing like a shadow to the Dutch fort, which he touched
with his hands, proceeded on to the Javan lines, where he
informed them that he had come by order of the sultan, to
give them a proof how near they might approach the Dutch
fort. He then hastened back to <em>Matárem</em> and reported the
disastrous state of the war, on which the sultan withdrew his
forces to <em>Kaliwúngu</em>."</p>

<p>The Dutch sent an ambassador with rich presents, and the
war ended in the Javan year 1551.</p>

<p>During the latter part of this prince's reign the country
appears to have enjoyed tranquillity, the only two occasions
in which it was disturbed being the revolt of the chiefs
of <em>Balambángan</em> and <em>Súmedang</em>, which may be considered as
the extreme points of the <em>Matárem</em> dominion, <em>Jákatra</em> and
<em>Bántam</em> having been effectually separated from them.</p>

<p>Sultan <em>Agung</em> is represented, even by the Dutch, as a well
informed and enlightened prince. He extended his dominion
not only over all Java and <em>Madúra</em>, but carried his
conquests to <em>Lándak</em> and other states on Borneo. He died
in the Javan year 1568, and was succeeded by his son,
<em>Pangéran Aria Prábu</em>, or <em>Aria Matárem</em>, then twenty-six
years of age.</p>

<p>This prince, on account of his mother being a princess of
<em>Chéribon</em>, succeeded, to the prejudice of his elder brother: he
held his court at <em>Pléret</em>, and is represented as the most severe
and tyrannical of Javan sovereigns. During a visit made by
the chief of <em>Chéribon</em> to <em>Matárem</em>, he received the distinction
of <em>Abdul Ráchman Sakiden</em>, in addition to the title of
<em>Susúnan Amangkúrat Senapáti Ingalága</em>, which he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1172" id="Page_1172">[Vol II Pg 172]</a></span>
assumed on his accession. On this occasion it is stated, that
he again conferred on the sultan of <em>Chéribon</em> all the eastern
districts of the island to the westward of <em>Túgu</em>, the supposed
limit of the <em>Majapáhit</em> empire, that is to say the districts of
<em>Brébes</em>, <em>Tegál</em>, <em>Pamálang</em>, <em>Ulujámi</em>, <em>Wiradésa</em>, <em>Pakalóng'an</em>,
<em>Bátang</em>, <em>Kendál</em>, and <em>Kaliwúngu</em>. The Dutch had already
firmly established their capital at Batavia, and secured an
influence in many of the former dependencies of Java, particularly
at <em>Sukadána</em> on Borneo and <em>Palembang</em> on Sumatra.</p>

<p>During the troubled reign of this prince, the Dutch appear
first to have entered into a written agreement with the acknowledged
sovereigns of Java. A treaty was ratified at Batavia
in the second year after his accession, on the 24th September
1646, the conditions of which were that the <em>Susuhúnan</em> should
be informed annually, by an ambassador, of the nature of the
curiosities which had arrived from Europe; that all priests,
or other persons, whom he might be desirous of sending to
foreign countries, should be conveyed thither in the Company's
ships; that all persons who should desert to either
country, for the purpose of evading their debts, should be
given up; that the Company and the <em>Susuhúnan</em> should
assist each other against their common enemies; that the
vessels of the <em>Susuhúnan's</em> subjects should be allowed to
trade to all places under the Company's authority, except
<em>Ambon</em>, <em>Banda</em>, and <em>Ternáté</em>, and that those bound to <em>Malácca</em>,
or places situated to the northward of that settlement, should
be obliged to touch at Batavia and to apply for passes.</p>

<p>A treaty was also entered into on the 10th July 1659,
between the Dutch and the sultan of Bantam, through the
mediation of the ambassadors of the <em>Pangéran</em> of <em>Jámbi</em>, in
which it was stipulated, that all prisoners of war and deserters
should be mutually restored, with the exception, on
the part of the sultan, of those who had embraced the Mahomedan
faith more than three months previous to that date,
those who had submitted to circumcision since that date to be
sent back, or if slaves and unwilling to return, the sultan to
pay the value of them to their masters: that the Dutch
should, as heretofore, have a permanent residence at Bantam,
for which purpose the same building was to be given which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1173" id="Page_1173">[Vol II Pg 173]</a></span>
they had occupied before the war, free of rent, and this building
to be secured, at the sultan's expense, against any hostile
attempts: that the river of <em>Untung Jáwa</em> should form the
boundary of the Bantam territory.</p>

<p>Certain provisions were made also to prevent illicit
trading.</p>

<p>Shortly after his accession, the chief of <em>Balambángan</em>,
aided by forces from <em>Báli</em>, again revolted, and an army was
sent against him. The troops, however, were no sooner set
in motion, than a plot was concerted against the prince's life,
with the knowledge of his younger brother, <em>Alit</em>; but intelligence
of it being communicated to the prince, <em>Aria Salíngsing</em>,
who had been the instigator of the plot, was with his son beheaded,
on the spot where a new <em>kráton</em> was erecting. On
the intercession of <em>Pangerán Purbáya</em>, the prince was disposed
to be lenient to his brother, as well on account of his age
as a strong affection which he bore towards him. Ascending
the royal eminence, the prince ordered the heads of the parties
to be brought, and summoning his brother <em>Alit</em> into his presence,
placed the heads before him, saying, "behold the reward of
those who have attempted to overthrow my authority.
Bring before me without delay all your followers." The
<em>Pangéran</em> immediately retired, and not knowing what was to
be the result, immediately assembled all his adherents and
attendants, and informed them of what had passed, when they
unanimously agreed to <em>amók</em> the <em>Susúnan's</em> party, urging that,
as soon as the <em>Matárem</em> people saw them commence to <em>amók</em>,
they would join them. The <em>Pangéran</em>, who was quite a youth,
gave into the plan, and they forthwith proceeded to the <em>alun
alun</em>, where they were not joined by a single man of the <em>Matárem</em>
people. They however commenced <em>amók</em>, and the
people fled in every direction, until <em>Pangéran Chákra Níngrat</em>
of <em>Madúra</em> approached <em>Alit</em>, kissed his feet, telling him it was
the order of the prince, who was aware of this proceeding,
that his person should be seized, but on no account wounded
or hurt, and implored him to surrender; but <em>Alit</em>, disregarding
his proposal, drew his <em>kris</em> and stabbed the <em>Pangéran</em>,
who died on the spot. The Madurese, who witnessed this
scene, immediately fell upon <em>Alit</em>, who was soon dispatched.
The <em>Susúnan</em> was deeply affected at the loss of his brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1174" id="Page_1174">[Vol II Pg 174]</a></span>
and in the violence of his agitation, on receiving the account
of what had passed, wounded himself in the left arm; and
from this period, the Javan historians state, "that he never
forgave an offence however trifling. When he was unhappy,
he always put to death those who were the cause of his unhappiness,
and on the slightest occasions was subject to the
most violent gusts of anger."</p>

<p>It is related that the prince evinced great sorrow for the
loss of his brother, and that when the time of mourning had
expired, he wreaked his vengeance on the supposed authors
of this calamity, by a massacre unparalleled in the annals of
the country. A rigorous investigation was instituted to ascertain
the abettors and accomplices in this attack against the
prince's life, and for this purpose a commission was appointed
under the direction of his favourites. The chiefs of the four
quarters of the capital were directed to inscribe the names of
all the priests within their respective divisions, under pretext
that the prince intended to confer certain marks of distinction
upon those who resided at <em>Matárem</em>, but in fact to
prevent their escape; for no sooner were the registers made
than a cannon was fired from the palace, as a signal to commence
the slaughter, and within less than half an hour all the
priests, whether guilty or innocent, with their wives and children,
amounting to upwards of six thousand souls, were inhumanly
and indiscriminately butchered.</p>

<p>On the following morning when the <em>Susúnan</em> appeared
in public, he seemed much agitated, and remained without
saluting his courtiers or uttering a word for the space of an
hour. He then addressed himself to his uncle <em>Purbáya</em>, saying
that the priests, who ought to have set an example to
others, had conspired against his life; and to cover the atrocity
of the massacre, he brought forward three or four priests, who
had been purposely saved from the general slaughter, and
from whom it was easy to obtain whatever evidence best
suited his purpose.</p>

<p>In the war against <em>Balambángan</em>, although the <em>Matárem</em>
forces were successful in obtaining possession of the capital,
the chief and his principal adherents fled to <em>Báli</em>. <em>Wíra
Gúna</em> was anxious to follow them; but a serious illness breaking
out among the troops, he was obliged to withdraw them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1175" id="Page_1175">[Vol II Pg 175]</a></span>
and retreat with the few who had survived, in number not
exceeding a thousand. On reaching <em>Kedíri</em>, intelligence was
sent to <em>Matárem</em> of the failure of the expedition, when the
<em>Susúnan</em> immediately ordered the chief, <em>Wíra Gúna</em>, with
all his family, to be put to death, under the pretext of punishing
his want of success, but in reality to satisfy a revenge,
which he had long been anxious to gratify against this chief,
on account of his having, during the lifetime of his father,
preferred a complaint against him for carrying off one of his
concubines.</p>

<p>It is said that the father of his first <em>rátu</em> (queen) having a
pet fowl, which had been produced from a jungle hen and a
domestic cock, brought it as a curiosity into the <em>kráton</em> and
gave it to the <em>Susúnan</em>. The <em>Susúnan</em> conceiving it to be an
omen, that as soon as the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em> became of age he
would quickly obtain the throne, assembled his <em>pengáwa</em> and
informed them of his apprehensions. The <em>Pangéran</em> on hearing
of it, immediately called all his family together, to the
number of sixty persons, who, on the first day that the <em>Susúnan</em>
appeared in public, sat themselves down in tears under the
<em>waríngen</em> tree. The <em>Susúnan</em> inquiring their object, they
called God and the Prophet to witness, that they were innocent
of the bare thought of any thing which should alarm the
mind of the <em>Susúnan</em>, and intreated that, if he anticipated
sorrow or misfortune from them, he would put them to death
immediately, and avert the apprehended calamity. The
<em>Susúnan</em> desired them not to listen to people who told them
such stories, and retired. Some time afterwards, the <em>Pangéran
Adipáti</em> fell desperately in love with a young woman,
who from her infancy had been brought up under an aged
<em>mántri</em> for the royal embrace. Becoming dangerously ill on
her account, he at length communicated the cause to his
grandfather, <em>Pangéran Pákik</em>, who prevailed on the <em>mántri</em>
to part with her for two thousand rings, one thousand dollars,
and a <em>káti</em> of gold. The young pair were immediately married.
As soon, however, as the <em>Susúnan</em> became apprized of
the transaction, he caused his son, the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>, to
appear before him with his young bride, and then directed
him, in his presence, to stab her to death. He afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1176" id="Page_1176">[Vol II Pg 176]</a></span>
banished his son, and sentenced the <em>Pangéran Pákik</em>, with all
his family, to capital punishment; and this aged chief, with
his wife, <em>Rátu Pándan</em>, and his relations, to the number of
forty, were accordingly put to death on the <em>alun alun</em>.</p>

<p>It is even related, among the atrocities committed by this
prince, that he violated his own daughter, <em>Rátu Bráwa</em>, who
was affianced to the son of <em>Panambáhan Gíri Láya</em> of <em>Chéribon</em>,
and that on the death of one of his wives, <em>Rátu Pamálang</em>,
he confined sixty of her attendants in a dark room, and
deprived them of food until they all died.</p>

<p>The injustice and severity of the <em>Susúnan</em> became still
greater as he advanced in years. His fits of anger became
more frequent, and the day and night were employed in barbarous
executions. Life enjoyed no security: every one was
upon his guard, and fears and apprehensions wrought among
people of the highest and the lowest rank. At length the
attention of the chiefs having been directed to the <em>Pangéran
Adipáti</em>, who had evinced a kind disposition in the presents
he was continually making to the poor, they implored him to
assume the government; and the young prince, entering into
their views, formed an agreement with the celebrated chief,
<em>Trúna Jáya</em>, who was the nephew of the <em>Bopáti</em> of <em>Madúra</em>,
<em>Chákra Níngrat</em>. It was by these means arranged, that
while <em>Chákra Níngrat</em> was at <em>Matárem</em>, <em>Trúna Jáya</em> should
forthwith proceed to <em>Madúra</em>, and there heading the Madurese
and the people of the eastern provinces, first rear the standard
of rebellion, while the young prince himself, to preserve
appearances, should remain at the court of his father, in seeming
ignorance of what was going on. No sooner had <em>Trúna
Jáya</em>, in prosecution of this plan, declared the independence
of <em>Madúra</em>, than there arrived at <em>Pasúruan</em> a considerable
force from <em>Makásar</em>, headed by <em>Dáin Galéngsong</em> and <em>Dáin
Manápok</em>. An army sent against them from <em>Matárem</em> was
repulsed, and the provinces of <em>Pásúruan</em>, <em>Probolíngo</em>, <em>Wirasába</em>,
and <em>Jápan</em>, submitted to their arms.</p>

<p>The first establishment of the Makásars in Java, appears to
have taken place A.D. 1675, when a chief from <em>Celebes</em>,
named <em>Kráin Monte-maráni</em>, with numerous followers, left
his country in discontent and settled in Java, to the eastward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1177" id="Page_1177">[Vol II Pg 177]</a></span>
of <em>Surabáya</em>, near <em>Besúki</em>, where he collected all the vagabonds
of the country, and committed great depredations by
sea and land.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, and finding himself unequal either to dislodge
the Makásar establishment or to reduce the Madurese
to submission, the <em>Susúnan</em> dispatched his son, <em>Pangérán
Púgar</em>, to the Dutch, A.D. 1676, with various presents, soliciting
their aid.</p>

<p>A second army was immediately assembled, and directed
to proceed by the route of <em>Japára</em>, where, according to the
Javan accounts, the chiefs had instructions to ask the assistance
of all the white people who had factories there, Dutch,
French, and Portuguese, and in case of refusal, to drive them
from the country. On this occasion the Dutch commandant
at <em>Japára</em> is represented as having said, "that this application
on the part of the <em>Susúnan</em>, was what the Dutch had
been long anxious for, and that he was ready to obey his
orders and sacrifice his life in his service."</p>

<p>This army was not more successful than the former in reducing
the revolted provinces to submission; but by the aid
of the Dutch, who had embarked a considerable force from
<em>Japára</em>, the Makásar chief was driven from his post: all the
wounded were brought to <em>Japára</em>. They also saved the body
of their chief, <em>Pra Wira Trúna</em>, who was killed on the occasion,
and sent it to <em>Matárem</em>.</p>

<p>It appears that the assistance sent by the Dutch on this
occasion, consisted of four ships and several smaller vessels
with troops, which were reinforced at <em>Japára</em> by the <em>Susúnan's</em>
troops and vessels. "Having arrived to the northward
of <em>Madúra</em>, they landed the troops, during the night, in the
forest, and in the morning sent a present to the Makásar
chief, requesting his permission to take in fresh water, of
which they stood in need, alleging it to be their intention to
depart immediately. This request being granted, the guns
were landed, and batteries thrown up behind the water-casks.
An attack was then made upon the enemy's works, and in a
few days the whole were demolished, the chief, <em>Krain Monte-maráni</em>
killed, and numerous prisoners taken."</p>

<p>On this intelligence reaching <em>Matárem</em>, the <em>Susúnan</em>
assembled all his family and chiefs, and directed another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1178" id="Page_1178">[Vol II Pg 178]</a></span>
attack to be made upon the hostile forces. A third army was
soon assembled at <em>Japára</em>, where the Dutch were ready to
join them: in the mean time, however, <em>Trúna Jáya</em> formed
an alliance with the Makásars.</p>

<p>The <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>, who was appointed to a command
in this army, had charge of the rear division, which he had
so arranged as to be able to act as emergency might require:
but he was soon released from his doubts, for <em>Trúna Jáya</em>
forgetting the agreement which he had entered into with this
prince, no sooner saw himself thus successful in the eastern
provinces, than he assumed the sovereignty himself, and
caused himself to be installed, under the title of <em>Prábu Máduréta
Senapáti Ingalága</em>, and confirmed his alliance with
the Makásars by giving his daughter in marriage to their
chief, <em>Dáin Galéngsong</em>.</p>

<p>The conditions of this alliance are said to have been, that
<em>Trúna Jáya</em> should be placed on the throne of <em>Matárem</em>,
<em>Dain Galéngsong</em> appointed chief of <em>Surabáya</em> and <em>Pasúruan</em>,
<em>Dain Manápok</em>, chief of the eastern and western districts of
<em>Balambángan</em>, and <em>Sheik Kajúran</em>, a crafty Arab chief of
<em>Madúra</em>.</p>

<p>After a desperate engagement, the forces of <em>Trúna Jáya</em>
were again successful. As a last effort, therefore, the venerable
<em>Pangéran Purbáyá</em>, uncle of the <em>Susúnan</em> and nearly
eighty years of age, summoned all the chiefs to follow him,
and going himself into the field of battle, performed extraordinary
feats of valour, till his horse having been shot under
him, and having himself for some time fought on foot, he was
overpowered, and his scattered forces compelled to retreat
towards <em>Matárem</em>.</p>

<p><em>Trúna Jáya</em> being now in full possession of <em>Surabáya</em> and
the eastern districts, pursued his success as far as <em>Japára</em>.
Here, however, he was effectually resisted by the chief,
<em>Angébái Wángsa-dípa</em> and the Dutch, and obliged to retreat.</p>

<p>As another division of his army, under <em>Ráden Dánang
Wichána</em>, rapidly approached <em>Matárem</em>, the <em>Susúnan</em> again
applied to the Dutch, who sent one of the members of government,
Admiral Speelman, to assist him with a considerable
force by land and sea. The admiral left Batavia in December,
1676, A.D., and shortly appeared before <em>Chéribon</em>, reducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1179" id="Page_1179">[Vol II Pg 179]</a></span>
to submission the coast districts from thence to <em>Japára</em>. The
fruit of this success, on the part of the Dutch, was the contract
of February 1677, of which the chief stipulations were:​&mdash;that
the <em>Susúnan</em> and Dutch should assist each other against
their common enemies, on condition that the expenses of the
war should be repaid by the party assisted: that the Dutch
jurisdiction at Batavia should extend to the <em>Kráwang</em> river,
and the Javans living to the westward of a line drawn from
that river to the southern shore, should be considered on the
Dutch territory: that the Dutch should be allowed to export
and import all species of goods and merchandize duty free,
and to establish a factory on any spot which they might deem
convenient: that Makásars, Maláyus, and Moormen, who
had not Dutch passes, should not be permitted to trade or
settle in the states of the <em>Susúnan</em>: that the <em>Susúnan</em> should
engage to reimburse the Dutch for the expense incurred in
assisting him against the Makásars and Madurese, amounting
to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and three thousand
lasts of rice, deliverable at Batavia: that in the event of a
peace being concluded between his highness and his enemies,
through the mediation of the Dutch, his highness should
abide by their decision; but, that if no accommodation was
effected by the 30th July following, he should pay to the
Dutch monthly the sum of twenty thousand reals, for the expenses
of the war: that the Dutch should station an adequate
force on <em>Japára</em> hill, in order to preserve that place for the
<em>Susúnan</em>, which force was also to be maintained at the expense
of his highness.</p>

<p>Admiral Speelman was invested by the <em>Susúnan</em> with full
powers to act against the Madurese and Makásars, and to
conclude such treaties with them as he should deem proper,
without any restriction whatsoever, and all the <em>Susúnan's</em>
subjects were commanded to join the standard of the admiral
wherever he might arrive.</p>

<p>In May following the allied forces of the Dutch and the
<em>Susúnan</em> gained a victory over <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, who was obliged
to fly to <em>Kedíri</em>, leaving behind him upwards of a hundred
pieces of cannon.</p>

<p>At length, the enemy being still in possession of all the
central provinces, and the trifling force which it was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1180" id="Page_1180">[Vol II Pg 180]</a></span>
power of the <em>Susúnan</em> to raise being defeated in every
skirmish, fear and dismay struck the remnant of the <em>Matárem</em>
forces; and the invading army having subdued <em>Pájang</em>, were
entering <em>Matárem</em>, when the <em>Susúnan</em>, seeing no hope for
safety except in flight, assembled his family in the dead of
the night, and collecting the regalia, quitted his capital with
his four sons, and mounted on an elephant, took a westerly
direction. This was in the Javan year 1600.</p>

<p>On the next day June 1677 the hostile troops entered
<em>Matárem</em>, when a force was immediately detached in pursuit
of the fugitive prince, who had pushed on to the <em>Kéndang</em>
hills, and halted at <em>Kájinar</em>, with an intention of making a
stand. Hearing of the strength of the pursuing force, however,
he left his family at that place, and proceeded with only
his son, the <em>Pangéran Adípáti</em>, to the village <em>Pasiráman</em>,
where being seized with a mortal complaint he soon died.
On his death-bed, informing his son that he felt his end approaching,
he thus addressed him: "You must assume the
sovereignty of Java, which has descended to you from your
forefathers. Make friends with the Dutch, and by their
assistance you may be enabled to reduce the eastern provinces
to submission. I deliver over to you part of the
sacred <em>pusáka</em> and regalia of the country; and now let my
body be carried to a spot where the earth is fragrant, and
there let it be buried."</p>

<p>In conformity with the wish of the deceased his body was
carried across the country towards <em>Tegál</em>, in search of a spot
where the earth was sweet-scented, and deposited a few miles
inland from the town. The tomb is still held in high veneration;
and it is from this circumstance that this prince is distinguished
by the appellation of <em>Susúnan Tegál-wáng'i</em>, or
<em>Tegál-árum</em>; <em>árum</em> and <em>wáng'i</em> signifying fragrant.</p>

<p>The rebel forces had, in the mean time, taken possession of
<em>Matárem</em>, and found among the articles of plunder the crown
of <em>Majapáhit</em>, with several other parts of the regalia, which
had been left behind in the hasty departure of the prince,
together with two of his daughters, named <em>Keletíng Wúng'u</em>
and <em>Keletíng Kúning</em>. The plunder was immediately dispatched
to <em>Kedíri</em>, where the rebel chiefs had established
their head quarters, and equally divided between <em>Trúng Jáya</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1181" id="Page_1181">[Vol II Pg 181]</a></span>
and <em>Dain Galéngsong</em>, with the exception of the regalia and
of the daughters of the <em>Susúnan</em>, whom <em>Trúna Jáya</em> espoused.</p>

<p>The loss on the side of the <em>Matárem</em> people is estimated
at fifteen thousand killed, and on the side of the eastern people
at somewhat less.</p>

<p>It is said in some accounts that the late <em>Susúnan</em> having
failed to persuade his son, <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>, to assume the
government, gave to another of his sons, <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>, the
<em>pusáka kris</em>, <em>máisa núlar</em>, and the spear <em>kiái paléret</em>, in consequence
of which <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>, with his brothers, returned
to <em>Bágelen</em>, where, assuming the title of <em>Susúnan Senapáti
Ingalága Abdul Ráchmen Sahídin Panatagáma</em>, he
assembled a considerable force, and proceeding to <em>Matárem</em>
regained possession of it.</p>

<p>After the interment of the deceased <em>Susúnan</em> at <em>Tegál</em>,
<em>Márta Láya</em>, the chief of that province, urged the <em>Pangéran
Adipáti</em> to assume the government, and first to establish himself
at <em>Tegál</em>, until he had collected a sufficient force to attack
the eastern people, offering his services to collect for him as
many people as would be required; but the prince still declined,
not having the courage to attempt the recovery of the
authority that belonged to his family, and requested <em>Márta
Láya</em> to procure for him a vessel, in which he might proceed
to <em>Mecca</em>, being resolved to relinquish for ever the cares of
government, and to become a <em>Háji</em>. <em>Márta Láya</em>, although
he had vessels at his disposal, evaded a compliance with the
prince's request, in the hope that he might alter his resolution,
and still be induced to assume the government. The
prince retired to <em>Bányumas</em>, and performed a penance in one
of the mosques. He is said on the seventh day to have fallen
asleep, and to have dreamt, "that the roof of the mosque
opened, as if it were carried up in the air, when a full and
bright moon appeared, which diffused its lustre over all
Java, after which it approached and entered his breast."
Encouraged by this omen, the prince changed his determination,
and recollecting the words of his father, bethought himself
of obtaining the assistance of the Dutch. He in consequence
dispatched two messengers to Batavia for aid.</p>

<p>The prince then sent orders to <em>Márta Láya</em> at <em>Tegál</em> to
collect as many forces as possible; he likewise dispatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1182" id="Page_1182">[Vol II Pg 182]</a></span>
trusty people to the <em>Désa Dúnan</em>, in search of the flower
called <em>wijáya mála</em>, there being a superstitious notion among
the Javans that if in their distress they are able to obtain this
flower, whatever they undertake will prosper.</p>

<p><em>Márta Láya</em> immediately exerted himself with great zeal
and effect to assemble his adherents, in the hope that by shewing
a large force he might induce the prince to relinquish his
idea of receiving succour from the Dutch. On the arrival of
this succour at <em>Tegál</em> he addressed him publicly as follows:​&mdash;"Sire,
I have felt excessive shame in hearing that your highness
is desirous of soliciting aid from the Hollanders, as if
you were yourself in want of men. I am now ready, with
numerous followers, to perform whatever you please, if you
will only confer upon me the necessary authority. Give
me but your orders and I will myself extirpate your
enemies." The prince replied, "What signifies your
shame, <em>Márta Láya</em>? I have requested assistance from
the Dutch, because it is always agreeable to rely on one's
friends; and it was foretold by my great grandfather, <em>Sultan
Agung</em>, that the Dutch would assist his descendants."
<em>Márta Láya</em> was silent. The messengers now returned with
the <em>wíjaya</em> flowers, on which the prince assumed the title of
<em>Susúnan Amangkúrat Senapáti Ingalága</em>, &amp;c.; and soon
afterwards the Dutch agreed to give him the assistance required.</p>

<p>When the Dutch force was landed, the <em>Susúnan</em> received
the visit of the admiral and officers in state. The Dutch
officers being introduced, stood in a row with their hats in
their hands; but <em>Márta Láya</em>, considering it disrespectful
that any one should stand in the presence of the sovereign,
ordered them immediately to sit down in the manner of the
Javans, and was proceeding to compel the admiral to do so,
when the <em>Susúnan</em>, seeing the confusion in which all were
thrown, applied to his late ambassador to the Dutch for an
explanation. When he learnt that they shewed respect by
bowing their heads only, he was satisfied, and desired <em>Márta
Láya</em> not to interfere with them.</p>

<p>"The <em>Susúnan</em> then inquired the name of the commander,
who after informing him that he had the rank of admiral, approached
him, saying, that he was ordered by the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1183" id="Page_1183">[Vol II Pg 183]</a></span>
of Batavia to proceed to <em>Tegál</em>, with a force of Europeans,
Makásars, &amp;c., and to afford him every assistance he might
require in the establishment of his authority. There were
landed valuable presents for the prince, among which was
very splendid apparel as worn by the Hollanders, to which the
prince took such a liking that he immediately clothed himself
in it. The Dutch force was then divided, and the admiral embarked
with one division for <em>Japára</em>, while the other accompanied
the prince, who proceded by land to <em>Pakalóngan</em>, and
afterwards with his followers by sea to <em>Japára</em>."</p>

<p>"On the arrival of the admiral at <em>Japára</em>, he inquired of
<em>Wángsa Dípa</em>, the chief of that place, who had rendered assistance
in repelling the rebels, at the time they attacked
<em>Japára</em>? To which the latter replied, 'The successful resistance
was principally owing to the conduct of the French,
English, and Dutch factories.' The admiral then consulted
with his officers, and observing that the English and
French seemed to be preferred to the Dutch, or at any rate
considered on the same footing, he called the chiefs of the
French and English factories, and presenting them with
twenty thousand dollars, said it was the gift of the <em>Susúnan</em>,
who directed that they would quit <em>Japára</em>. The chiefs of the
two factories took the money, but did not wish to depart,
alleging that there were no vessels to convey them away; to
which the admiral replied, that in that case he had the further
orders of the <em>Susúnan</em> to provide them with a vessel. The
people belonging to the two factories were then, with all their
property, public and private, embarked on board a Dutch
transport. The vessel sailed, but nothing more was ever heard
of the English and French who were embarked in her. The
Dutch then repaired their instruments of war."</p>

<p>Another account is as follows: "When the admiral arrived
at <em>Japára</em>, he found there two foreign vessels, an English
and a French ship, the officers of which said they had put in
there in distress, and could not proceed further on account of
the bad state of their ships. They also represented that they
had assisted the Dutch when the rebels attacked <em>Japára</em>.
The admiral thanked them for the service they had rendered,
and presented them with ten thousand dollars, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1184" id="Page_1184">[Vol II Pg 184]</a></span>
ordered them to proceed to their own country in one of his
vessels."</p>

<p>"On the arrival of the <em>Susúnan</em> at <em>Japára</em>, he was joined
by a considerable force from <em>Tegál</em> and <em>Demák</em>; and among
those who were most active in the support of the <em>Susúnan's</em>
authority was <em>Márta Láya</em>, whose aversion to the Dutch still
continued. The admiral, apprized of his sentiments, applied
to the <em>Susúnan</em> for his destruction, supporting his application
by a written request to the same effect from the government of
the capital, and threatening an immediate departure to Batavia
in case of non-compliance.</p>

<p>"To accomplish this end, the <em>Susúnan</em> first attempted to
send him to <em>Kedíri</em> against <em>Trúna Jáya</em>; but <em>Márta Láya</em>
obtaining information of the demand made by the Dutch for
his life, refused to attend the summons, on the pretence of
sickness. His disobedience so enraged the <em>Susúnan</em>, that he
ordered his instant death, which was effected in the following
manner. <em>Márta Púra</em> having received the orders of the
prince to put <em>Márta Láya</em> to death, went to his house,
accompanied by two hundred followers. <em>Márta Láya</em> having
been apprized of the <em>Susúnan's</em> anger, he collected an equal
number of men.</p>

<p>"When <em>Márta Púra</em> approached him he was seated on a
yellow carpet with a drawn <em>kris</em> in his hand, and being
informed that he was to be put to death by order of the
<em>Susúnan</em>, <em>Márta Láya</em> replied, 'If it is the wish of the
prince that it should be so, do your duty, I am prepared.'
<em>Márta Púra</em> then drew his <em>kris</em> and stabbed <em>Márta Láya</em> in
the belly; but while he did so his neck received in return the
<em>kris</em> of <em>Márta Láya</em>, which separating the throat in two,
killed him on the spot. The two chiefs were no sooner
wounded than the followers of both parties rushed on each
other, and a most bloody and obstinate engagement ensued,
which lasted till the bodies of nearly the whole lay weltering
round those of the chiefs."</p>

<p>Measures had already been taken for the dispersion of the
rebel forces in <em>Kedíri</em>. A Makásar chief, named <em>Kráin Kadádrang</em>,
in the service of the Dutch, discovered his relationship
to the Makásar chief <em>Galéngsong</em>, and offered to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1185" id="Page_1185">[Vol II Pg 185]</a></span>
him to terms. He was in consequence dispatched secretly to
<em>Kedíri</em>, where he had an interview with the <em>Makásar</em> chief,
who was his brother. On the part of the Dutch, he promised
that they would assist him on Celebes. He hesitated to come
over immediately, lest he should betray <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, but promised
to join the allied forces when they should arrive and
attack <em>Trúna Jáya</em>.</p>

<p>Having thus secured an interest with the Makásars, one
division of the Dutch forces, under the admiral, embarked
for <em>Surabáya</em>, and the other, with the <em>Susúnan</em>, commenced
their march by land. A decisive battle took place at <em>Kedíri</em>;
on the evening previous to which, it is asserted the Dutch
had a communication with <em>Dain Galéngsong</em>, to know his
intentions, when the latter told them, "Attack me to-morrow,
and I will make arrangements for the flight of my forces."
Accordingly the next morning, before the daylight, the Dutch
troops marched to the hostile camp, where they found no preparations
for resistance. <em>Dain Galéngsong</em> immediately
ordered a retreat, and fled himself the first, leaving behind
him all the plunder that had been taken at <em>Matárem</em>, and
among other things the crown of <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Kedíri</em>, according to the Dutch accounts,
lasted fifty days, and it was at last taken by assault, <em>Trúna
Jáya</em> making his escape. Great riches were found in the
interior of the palace, and many chests of Spanish dollars,
besides ingots of gold and the most valuable part of the
regalia. The <em>Susúnan</em> claimed nothing but the crown of
<em>Majapáhit</em>, leaving the remainder to be distributed among the
troops.</p>

<p>When the crown was delivered to him, it appeared that its
most splendid ornament, the large centre diamond, was
missing. This the <em>Susúnan</em> immediately noticed, and inquiries
were set on foot; but to the great affliction of the <em>Susúnan</em>
and all the Javan chiefs, the jewel was never recovered.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Nine Makásar chiefs afterwards surrendered to the Dutch
on the 9th December, when they received pardon, and a promise
that they should be sent to Makásar.</p>

<p>After this <em>Trúna Jáya</em> collected all his forces, and marshalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1186" id="Page_1186">[Vol II Pg 186]</a></span>
them upon the plain, as if to receive the enemy; but
on the approach of the Dutch troops from the left and the
Javans from the right, his army was panic struck and fled in
various directions, he himself with his two wives escaping to
Antang. The <em>Susúnan</em> allowed the Dutch soldiers to plunder
and possess themselves of every thing left by the rebels.</p>

<p><em>Chákra Níngrat</em> having quitted his place of banishment
and joined the <em>Susúnan</em>, was sent to urge the submission of
his half-brother, <em>Trúna Jáya</em>. <em>Chákra Níngrat</em> accordingly
went in search of <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, accompanied by a very few
followers, and having found him at <em>Antang</em> he addressed him
as follows. "Brother! what are you doing and whither
would you fly? Depend upon it, if you persist in your resistance
to the will of the <em>Susúnan</em>, he will disappoint your
expectations, and if you compel him to send people to
arrest you, you will excite his implacable displeasure. I
have come to you as quickly as possible, for my heart yearns
towards you, and I dread lest you should come to any misfortune.
If you wish it, I will go and meet the <em>Susúnan</em>.
Bring your two wives, who are both the sisters of the
<em>Susúnan</em>, throw yourselves together at his feet, ask forgiveness
for any offence you have committed, and perhaps
he will be merciful towards you and grant you pardon. If
you come alone in that way, the <em>Susúnan</em> cannot act against
you, for are you not married to his sisters?" <em>Trúna Jáya</em>
reflected upon what <em>Chákra Níngrat</em> said, and was inclined
to follow his advice, saying, "I return abundant thanks to you
for your kindness towards me. Your advice is good and I
will follow it: I will follow you, accompanied by my wives."
<em>Trúna Jáya</em> with his wives afterwards accompanied <em>Chákra
Níngrat</em> to <em>Kedíri</em>.</p>

<p><em>Chákra Níngrat</em> then led <em>Trúna Jáya</em> with his wives to
the hall of audience, where the <em>Susúnan</em> was seated with the
admiral and numerous Dutch officers. <em>Trúna Jáya</em> on this
occasion did not wear his <em>kris</em>, but rolled a <em>chíndi</em> cloth round
his body, as if he were a prisoner.</p>

<p>They fell at the feet of the <em>Susúnan</em>, imploring forgiveness
for the offence of <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, on which the <em>Susúnan</em>
said, 'It is well! <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, for this time I forgive you.
Go without and clothe yourself in becoming apparel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1187" id="Page_1187">[Vol II Pg 187]</a></span>
then return to me, when I will present you with a <em>kris</em>,
and instal you as my minister, in the presence of all
assembled.' The <em>Susúnan</em> then gave orders that he should
be served with apparel. The heart of <em>Trúna Jáya</em> became
highly elated: he went out and received the apparel from the
<em>Susúnan's</em> people, and then returned into the presence, but
without wearing a <em>kris</em>, as the <em>Susúnan</em> had intimated his
intention to present him with one.</p>

<p>"As he approached, the <em>Susúnan</em> desired his women to
bring him the <em>kris</em> named <em>Kiái belábar</em>, which was still unsheathed.
As soon as it was delivered into the hands of the
<em>Susúnan</em>, he said to <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, 'Know, <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, that
I have given my word that I would never sheathe this <em>kris</em>
except in your body: receive now your death from it in
punishment of your offence.' <em>Trúna Jáya</em> was silent, while
the <em>Susúnan</em> standing up approached and stabbed him with
his <em>kris</em> in the breast. Returning then to his throne he seated
himself, and ordered his people who were assembled to finish
the work which he had begun, whereupon they all fell upon
<em>Trúna Jáya</em>, the unfortunate wretch, stabbing him in a thousand
places and cutting his body to pieces. They then severed
the head from the trunk, rolled it in the mud, made a mat of
it, and at last cast it into a ditch by the express order of the
<em>Susúnan</em>. The admiral and all the Dutch officers and party
were present at this execution; but though they appeared
astonished at the conduct of the <em>Susúnan</em>, they remained
quiet spectators of it."</p>

<p>Such is the account given by the Javans, without reference
to the share which the Dutch had in the transaction; but
from the Dutch accounts it appears that <em>Trúna Jáya</em> delivered
himself up under a stipulation with the Dutch that his life
should be spared. A young officer of the name of <em>Jengker</em>,
who had been placed by the General (Cooper) in charge of
the <em>Susúnan's</em> guard, was sent by the <em>Susúnan</em> to treat with
<em>Trúna Jáya</em>, without any communication with or authority
from his commanding officer. Valentyn says positively, that
<em>Jengkér</em> promised him pardon, and assured him of his life;
but Cooper, annoyed that the credit of taking this chief should
thus have been wrested from him by a junior officer acting
without authority, exasperated the <em>Susúnan</em> against <em>Trúna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1188" id="Page_1188">[Vol II Pg 188]</a></span>
Jáya</em>, and threw that unfortunate chief in his way at a moment
when his passion was at its height. This catastrophe,
says Valentyn, is to be ascribed to no one but the jealous
Cooper, who brought it about, in order that his bad conduct,
oppressions, and extortions, which were well known to <em>Trúna
Jáya</em>, and which he had intended to complain of, should
remain concealed.</p>

<p><em>Trúna Jáya</em>, at the time of his surrender, was dressed in a
Portuguese jacket, and wore on his head a black turban edged
with lace. He gave short and pertinent answers to the questions
put to him. On his coming before <em>Jengker</em> he fell at
his feet, saying, that in his youth it had been predicted that,
however great his fortune might be, still he should, at one
time of his life, be taken prisoner, and that since this was his
destiny, he rejoiced in having fallen into the hands of a person
so well known for his humanity. He then presented to him
his <em>krís</em> with a golden bow, requesting <em>Jengker</em> to keep them
in token of his esteem. <em>Jengker</em> lifted him up, promised that
his life should be spared, and further, that all his influence
with the Dutch government and the <em>Susúnan</em> should be used
in his behalf. It is alleged in the Dutch accounts, that the
immediate cause of the <em>Susúnan's</em> conduct on this occasion,
was the irreconcilable hatred which <em>Trúna Jáya</em> still evinced
towards that prince, who, he said, had in his youth encouraged
him to the steps he had taken, and afterwards abandoned him.</p>

<p><em>Trúna Jáya</em> surrendered on the 25th December, 1679, A.D.,
and general tranquillity ensued, which however was not of
long duration. The <em>Panambáhan Gíri</em> having in his possession
the <em>kris</em> deposited in the tomb of the first <em>Súnan</em>, it was
demanded of him by the <em>Susúnan</em> as royal property; but the
<em>Panambáhan</em> not being inclined to part with it, and disapproving
of the conduct of the <em>Susúnan</em>, who was guided by Dutch
councils, and had even adopted their dress, replied, that he
did not wish to know any thing of the <em>Susúnan</em>, or to be acquainted
with him; that he wished to wear the <em>kris</em>, <em>kálam
múning</em>, himself, and that he preferred his own dignity to
that of such a chief. The <em>Susúnan</em>, enraged at this answer,
proceeded to <em>Gíri</em> with his Dutch allies, where an engagement
took place and the <em>Gíri</em> people were obliged to fly: the <em>Panambáhan</em>
was taken and put to death. In this affair, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1189" id="Page_1189">[Vol II Pg 189]</a></span>
cousin of the <em>Súnan Káli Jága</em> of <em>Adilángo</em>, who had followed
the <em>Susúnan</em>, distinguished himself in destroying the brother
of the <em>Punambáhan Pangéran Sínga Sári</em>, who was running
<em>amók</em>, and doing much mischief; as a reward for which service
the <em>Súnan</em>, in the presence of the Dutch commander,
declared that, for ever after that, the descendants of that chief
should be permitted to reside at <em>Adiláng'o</em>, and not be called
upon to perform any duties of the state.</p>

<p>The whole of the eastern provinces having now submitted,
the <em>Susúnan</em> returned to <em>Semárang</em>, where when he had made
acknowledgments to the Dutch for the assistance they had
rendered him, the commander requested that he would give
them a small piece of ground at <em>Semárang</em> to build a fort
upon, which would not only be convenient for the protection
of their trade, but would enable them to come to the assistance
of the <em>Susúnan</em>, if necessary, at a shorter notice.</p>

<p>The admiral having promised that he would station a suitable
force at <em>Semárang</em>, which the <em>Susúnan</em> might at any
time employ as he thought proper, obtained the permission he
applied for.</p>

<p>The Javans have a superstitious belief, that when once
misfortune has fallen on a place so generally as to extend to
the common people (which was the case at <em>Matárem</em>), it
will never afterwards prosper; it was therefore determined by
the <em>Susúnan</em> to change the seat of empire, and some were for
fixing it at <em>Semárang</em>, but at last it was determined to erect
it in the wood <em>Wána Kérta</em>, in the district of <em>Pájang</em>, which
was good land but uninhabited.</p>

<p>The new capital was called <em>Kérta-súra</em>, the walls of which
are still to be seen on the road to <em>Súra-kérta</em>, the present
capital of the <em>Susúnan</em>.</p>

<p>During all these transactions <em>Pangéran Pugar</em> remained at
<em>Matárem</em>. The <em>Susúnan</em> now, for the first time, sent him
information of his establishment, and required his attendance
at court. The <em>Pangéran</em>, who having heard that the <em>Susúnan</em>
was in the constant habit of dressing after the Dutch fashion,
had been strengthening himself as much as possible, under
an impression, that the <em>Susúnan</em> supported by the Dutch was
not his brother, but a foreigner, whom they had raised to
answer their own purposes, received this intimation with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1190" id="Page_1190">[Vol II Pg 190]</a></span>
surprise, and sent two of his family to ascertain the truth.
The messengers, who were interested in upholding the separate
authority of their master, determined to encourage his
mistake, and they represented the <em>Susúnan</em> as a foreigner
from <em>Sábrang</em>, elevated by the Dutch. Upon this report the
<em>Pangéran</em> informed the <em>Susúnan</em> that he could not proceed to
<em>Kérta Súra</em>, as he preferred remaining at <em>Matárem</em>, where he
was established as the legal sovereign. A force, consisting
of Dutch and Javan troops, was in consequence marched
against <em>Matárem</em>; at first the troops of <em>Kérta-súra</em> were defeated,
but in a second attack they were more successful, and
the <em>Pangéran</em> was obliged to take to flight.</p>

<p>By means of the <em>Adipáti</em>, the <em>Pangéran</em> was afterwards
assured of the <em>Susúnan</em> being his brother, when he agreed to
go to <em>Kérta-súra</em>, provided the <em>Susúnan</em> would throw off his
Dutch dress and appear in his native costume. To this the
sovereign consented, and publicly received his brother with
the greatest demonstrations of joy and affection.</p>

<p>The authority of the <em>Susúnan</em> was now firmly established,
and general tranquillity prevailed for some years.</p>

<p>A new character now appears on the stage, under the title
of <em>Surapáti</em>. This man, whose name was <em>Sí Untung</em>, had
been the slave boy of a Dutchman at Batavia, of the name of
Mor, who is represented to have been of low origin, but to
have been advanced to the highest dignities, even a seat in
the high regency, by means of the riches and influence he had
acquired through the services of this slave, to whom he became,
in consequence, much attached. Mor, however, discovering
an improper intimacy between <em>Untung</em> and his natural
daughter, chastised him severely, and afterwards had
him confined in the public block or stocks. <em>Untung</em> contrived
to effect his escape from them during the night, and to
release his fellow prisoners. They then fell upon the guard
which came to mount at daylight, and taking them unawares
massacred the whole. Being thus committed, <em>Untung</em> bent
his course to the high lands, and afterwards to <em>Chéribon</em>.
While in the high lands he formed a connection with a formidable
party from Bantam, where a civil war had been excited,
in consequence of the Dutch having elevated to the
throne a son of the deceased king, contrary to the express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1191" id="Page_1191">[Vol II Pg 191]</a></span>
directions of the father. One of the brothers, <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em>,
was prevailed upon to join a certain <em>Abidin</em>, a fanatic
rebel, who had raised about two thousand followers, and with
him passed through <em>Jasíngá</em> and the <em>Jákatra</em> and <em>Preángan</em>
highlands, increasing their numbers as they went.</p>

<p><em>Abidin</em> having proposed to proceed by that route to <em>Matárem</em>,
there to stir up the <em>Susúnan</em> against the Dutch, the
<em>Pangéran</em> being tired of the journey surrendered to the Dutch
force sent against them; but <em>Abidin</em> stood a severe engagement,
and was only induced to surrender by means of an artifice
practiced upon him. An European officer belonging to
the Dutch troops disguised himself as an Arab, and being
well versed in the Arabic and Malayu languages, obtained an
interview with <em>Abidin</em>, to whom he represented, that having
himself been once taken prisoner by the Dutch he had been
so well treated that he would advise him to go and surrender
himself. The unfortunate man took his advice, and was conveyed
to the commanding officer, then at <em>Chikálong</em>, who immediately
forwarded him to Batavia, whence he was sent to
the Cape of Good Hope for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The party of runaway slaves under <em>Untung</em>, who had now
assumed the name of <em>Santána</em> being surprized by the Dutch
force, were by special orders from Batavia allowed to remain
undisturbed for the present. The chief appears to have been
useful to the Dutch, and to have been employed, in order the
better to secure the surrender of <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em>. When
the Dutch officer went with a small party to receive the submission
of this chief, he found that he had already tied his
spears together (the sign of surrender) and kept no arms but
his <em>kris</em>. Ignorant of the customs of the country, the officer
demanded that the <em>Pangéran</em> should also deliver this weapon
and his personal ornaments. The demand created the utmost
astonishment in the <em>Pangéran</em>, who instantly asked if it was
not sufficient humiliation to a prince of the royal blood that
he and his people had given up their arms. <em>Santána</em> entreated
of the Dutch officer not to urge the delivery of the
<em>kris</em>, and to consider "that the bird, although caught, was not
yet in the cage," but to no purpose: the officer persisted in
his demand, and insulted <em>Santána</em> in presence of all who
were there assembled. The <em>Pangéran</em> seeing that resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1192" id="Page_1192">[Vol II Pg 192]</a></span>
was now vain, promised compliance next morning; but during
the night, to the inexpressible mortification of the officer, he
effected his escape. The rage of the officer now fell so violently
upon <em>Santána</em>, that a quarrel ensued. <em>Santána</em> and
his followers fell upon the Dutch party and killed many of
them; the officer however escaped. <em>Santána</em> then moved
towards <em>Chéribon</em>, where he had an affair with a chief, named
<em>Ráden Surapáti</em>, which being reported to the sultan, that
chief was put to death, and his title of <em>Surapáti</em> conferred
upon <em>Untung</em>. <em>Surapáti</em> then proceeded towards <em>Kérta-súra</em>
to beg assistance against the Dutch, leaving several of his
followers in <em>Bányumas</em>, under the direction of two chiefs,
who soon became dreaded as noted <em>kramans</em> or rebels. At
<em>Kérta-súra</em> he found protection from the prime minister, to
whom he related all the particulars of the story, with the exception
of that part which related to the establishment he had
formed in <em>Bányumas</em>. This district being now declared in a
state of revolt, he offered to bring it to submission, and was
employed by the <em>Susúnan</em> for that purpose; he accordingly
proceeded secretly to <em>Bányumas</em>, where, aided by the plan he
had before laid, he caused the heads of the two <em>krámans</em> to
be secretly cut off in the night, and the rebels to disperse;
when returning to <em>Kérta-súra</em> and producing the heads, he
was received into the highest favour by the <em>Susúnan</em>.</p>

<p>The Dutch hearing of his fortune, demanded from the
<em>Susúnan</em> that his person should be given up; but the reply
of the <em>Susúnan</em> was, "that <em>Surapáti</em> having thrown himself
on his protection and performed a signal service to the empire,
he could not give him up; but that if the Dutch wished
that he should be arrested, they were at perfect liberty to
arrest him in any part of his dominions."</p>

<p>The Dutch, accordingly sent a force, consisting of four hundred
Europeans and six hundred islanders, under the orders
of one Tak, an officer who had incurred the suspicion of having
purloined the centre diamond from the <em>Majapáhit</em> crown,
and on whom, according to the impression which pervades
the Dutch accounts, the <em>Susúnan</em> had determined to be revenged.</p>

<p>On the approach of the Dutch troops, the <em>Susúnan</em>, alarmed
lest they should succeed in arresting <em>Surapáti</em>, determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1193" id="Page_1193">[Vol II Pg 193]</a></span>
afford him every assistance, and for that purpose directed,
that when they arrived, the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> (prime minister),
who had given his daughter in marriage to <em>Surapáti</em>, should
openly espouse his cause, and proceed, in the first instance,
to attack the lines of the <em>Adipátis</em> of <em>Madúra</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>,
who after a skirmish should retreat to the <em>alun alun</em> in confusion,
exhibiting all the appearance of a defeat, while the
united party of the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em>, and <em>Sarapáti</em> should appear
to threaten the <em>kráton</em>. The <em>Pangéran Púgar</em> being
strongly attached to <em>Surapáti</em>, received orders, that if, in the
affair with the Dutch, the party of <em>Surapáti</em> and the minister
should be worsted, he should render them assistance, by
sending his people to them clothed in white, the distinction
adopted by <em>Surapáti</em>.</p>

<p>When the Dutch arrived, to cover appearances, a new
prime minister was appointed. The commander requested
assistance from the <em>Susúnan</em>, who pointed out to him the apparent
state of affairs, and induced him to believe that he was
himself in danger from the attack of <em>Surapáti</em>. Under this
impression, Tak made his arrangements; and the Dutch troops
appeared on the front <em>alun alun</em> at eight o'clock in the morning,
when they were immediately attacked by <em>Surapáti</em>. After
four hours of hard fighting, <em>Surapáti</em> was repulsed; but reinforcements
being sent by <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>, and by the whole
population of the city, the Dutch were completely destroyed.
Tak, at his last extremity, ordered out from the fort two hundred
soldiers remaining there; but as they could not join
their companions, they were immediately surrounded and cut
up. Of the two thousand men, eleven hundred and eighty-three
lost their lives; and among them Tak, who was mortally
wounded in the neck by the celebrated <em>pusáka</em> spear of
<em>Pangéran Púgar</em>. The weapon was found blunted at the
point by the chain jacket which Tak is said to have worn on
the occasion.</p>

<p>The <em>Susúnan</em> now directed the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> and <em>Surapáti</em>
to take refuge in the province of <em>Pasúruan</em>, and assume
the habit of devotees; while to the <em>Adipátis</em> of <em>Madúra</em> and
<em>Surabáya</em> orders were given to follow them at a certain distance,
burning the villages and laying waste the country, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1194" id="Page_1194">[Vol II Pg 194]</a></span>
in pursuit of an enemy. When <em>Surapáti</em> reached <em>Pasúruan</em>,
he took the name of <em>Adipáti Wíra Nagára</em>.</p>

<p>The few Dutch who had survived made their escape to the fort
of <em>Japára</em>, which was then more extensive than that at <em>Semárang</em>.</p>

<p>After this the <em>Susúnan</em> wrote to the commanding officer at
<em>Japára</em>, informing him that Tak, with all the party, had been
killed by the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> and <em>Surapáti</em>, who had also
attacked him, but that they had at last driven them to the eastward,
by the force he had collected under the <em>Adipátis</em> of <em>Madúra</em>
and <em>Surabáya</em>. He also informed him that he had
elected a new prime minister, in lieu of the one who had
espoused the cause of <em>Surapáti</em>. The <em>Susúnan</em>, fearing lest
this story might not be believed, and that he might be suspected
of having assisted <em>Surapáti</em>, sent with this letter five
<em>píkuls</em> of birds' nests, forty oxen, and other articles of value,
which he entrusted to the care of a <em>priái gándok</em> (a messenger
of distinction) named <em>Jága Rága</em>, with instructions to mark
well the thoughts of the commander or officer who was the
chief of <em>Japára</em>, and if he shewed the least suspicion of the
part the <em>Susúnan</em> had taken, mainly to deny it, and firmly to insist
that the <em>Susúnan</em> was true-hearted to the Hollanders. He
moreover promised to his ambassador, that if he succeeded in
averting the anger of the Dutch, he would reward him on his
return.</p>

<p>This messenger accordingly proceeded to <em>Japára</em>, when the
chief officer, after reading the letter, said he had heard the
<em>Susúnan</em> was of one heart with <em>Surapáti</em>; to which <em>Jága
Rága</em> replied, that what he had heard was false, and that perhaps
the story might have originated in the part taken by the
<em>Ráden Adipáti</em>, whose attachment to <em>Surapáti</em> was well
known. He then referred to the circumstance of the country's
being laid waste by <em>Surapáti</em> on his flight to the eastward, in
proof of his enmity. The commander heard this explanation
with patience, and after receiving the presents, with which
he was much pleased, returned for answer to the <em>Susúnan</em>, that
he had first heard that he was favourable to <em>Surapáti</em>, but
was now convinced, from the explanation afforded, that these
reports were unfounded, and that he was satisfied of the lasting
attachment of his highness to the Dutch. He then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1195" id="Page_1195">[Vol II Pg 195]</a></span>
thanked him for his present, and in return sent one thousand
ducatoons, with an assortment of velvets and cloth. The
messenger having thus succeeded, was raised to the rank and
station of <em>Tumúng'gung</em> of <em>Japára</em>, by the name and title of
<em>Kiái Tumúng'gung Márta Púra</em>.</p>

<p>The next indignity offered to the Dutch was by this man,
who laid hold of a half cast Dutch soldier at <em>Japára</em>, and insisted
upon his sitting on the ground on his hams and dancing
the <em>tandák</em>, after the fashion of the Javans, for his amusement.
The Dutch, highly incensed, demanded the immediate
release of the man; but the <em>Tumúng'gung</em> refusing, an application
was sent to the <em>Susúnan</em>, requesting that <em>Márta Púra</em>
might be put to death. The <em>Susúnan</em> immediately sent for
<em>Pangéran Púgar</em> and his minister, and desired them to communicate
with <em>Márta Púra</em>, and if they found he had the
courage to oppose the Dutch to give him assistance under
hand, or to promote his success by some stratagem, in the
same manner as he had done to <em>Surapáti</em>; but if not, to let
him be sacrificed, as a punishment for his cowardice. He
then replied to the commodore, saying, that he had sent his
own people to arrest <em>Márta Púra</em>, and to deliver him to the
commander, who might act with his person as he thought
proper. When the minister arrived at <em>Japára</em> it was agreed
that <em>Márta Púra</em> should be invited into the Dutch fort, and
there apprehended early next morning; but in the meantime
the agents of the <em>Susúnan</em> had a secret interview with the
chief, who declared himself ready to oppose the Dutch, and
it was determined that their pretending to seize him should
be a signal for all to join and <em>amók</em> the Hollanders: but in
the morning the heart of <em>Márta Púra</em> failed him. He twice
refused to quit his retreat, and when at last he came into the
presence of the party, he appeared trembling and pale, and
his knees tottered under him, so that he was scarcely able to
stand. They then gave him a chair to sit down upon, and plied
him with wine. An officer having taken his <em>kris</em> from behind
him, he rose from his chair and attempted to escape, but was
bayoneted by a soldier on his way. The agents of the <em>Susúnan</em>,
enraged to see him so thoroughly frightened, gave him
no assistance, but ordered the dogs to devour his carcase.
When the <em>Susúnan</em> heard of the cowardly conduct of <em>Márta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1196" id="Page_1196">[Vol II Pg 196]</a></span>
Púra</em> he ordered that it should be publicly prohibited, on pain
of his severest punishment, to harbour or afford assistance to
his relations or children.</p>

<p>Afterwards the former <em>Tumúng'gung</em> of <em>Japára</em>, <em>Sécha Nagára</em>,
was replaced, and a communication was, through him,
made to the Dutch, intimating the willingness of the <em>Susúnan</em>
to co-operate against the <em>Surapáti</em>, in consequence of which
orders were given for the Dutch troops to proceed from Batavia.
When the <em>Susúnan</em> had thus drawn the Dutch into a
second attack upon this chieftain, he is represented "as being
most delighted at the prospect which it afforded, that on
the present occasion more of the Dutch troops might be
sacrificed, in the same manner as in the recent affair at
<em>Kérta Súra</em>."</p>

<p>The <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Surabáya</em> and <em>Madúra</em> were immediately
dispatched to <em>Pasúruan</em> to meet the Dutch, but having waited
some time in vain for the arrival, a mock battle took place
with <em>Surapáti</em>, when it was arranged that the <em>Kérta Súra</em>
troops should take to flight, burning and laying waste the
country as they retreated. A regular communication appears
to have been kept up during the whole time between <em>Surapáti</em>
and the <em>Susúnan</em>, who allowed him quietly to possess himself
of the adjoining districts of <em>Málang</em> and <em>Mádion</em>. The
<em>Ráden Adipáti Aúrang Kasúma</em> died about this time.</p>

<p>The Dutch troops now arrived in the eastern districts, and
the commandant of <em>Japára</em> applied for the assistance of the
<em>Susúnan</em>; but the latter, alleging that his chiefs had been
recently beaten and obliged to retreat from <em>Pasúruan</em>, urged
delay, on the plea of waiting a more favourable opportunity
of attack.</p>

<p>In the meantime family feuds disturbed the peace of the
<em>kráton</em>. The hereditary prince, <em>Pangéran Adipáti Amángku
Nagára</em>, had married the daughter of his cousin, <em>Pangéran
Púgar</em>, but after the expiration of the forty days he disregarded
her, and she returned to her father's protection. One
of the most distinguished characters at the court was the son
of the prime minister. The hereditary prince, jealous of the
universal admiration which he enjoyed, determined to lower
him by the infliction of the greatest disgrace which could be
endured. Naturally of a fiery disposition, he became exces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1197" id="Page_1197">[Vol II Pg 197]</a></span>sively
enraged at an accident which occurred to him while
hunting in the forest of <em>Ránda Wahána</em>, and which occasioned
a lameness in his legs. As soon as he returned home
he sent for this youth, whom he immediately ordered to be
bound and severely flogged with a rattan: he then directed
him to be tied to a tree abounding with ants, which soon
covered his body; a favourite mode of inflicting cruel punishment.
There the young man suffered dreadfully, but his
tortures were not at an end: he was afterwards flogged till he
nearly expired, and then sent to the house of his father, the
prime minister, who, although much enraged, was obliged to
suppress his resentment. Determined afterwards to revenge
himself, he seduced the wife of the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>, who
had returned to her father's house, as above stated. The connection
was discovered, and all parties were put to death.</p>

<p>The <em>Susúnan</em> becoming now dangerously ill, from an affection
of the spleen which he had contracted at the time of the
massacre of the Dutch under Tak, called into his presence his
eldest son, the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>, his brother, <em>Pangéran
Púgar</em>, and his two firm adherents, the <em>Adipátis</em> of <em>Madúra</em>
and <em>Surabáya</em>, and thus addressed them: "The time which
is allotted to me in this world has nearly expired; but
before I depart let me impress upon you all the necessity
and advantage of your mutually supporting each other. If
you hold together, then will the sovereignty of Java become
pure and strong. The <em>Adipátis</em> of <em>Madúra</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>
will be as the surface of the <em>támpa</em> (or sifter) on which rice
is cleansed from the husk; the <em>Pangéran Púgar</em> as the
<em>wángku</em> (or rim of the sifter); and the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>
will be as the one who sifts or fans the rice. When the
<em>Pangéran Adipáti</em> ascends the throne, let him attach himself
to the other three, by which means he will cleanse and
strengthen his government, even as the rice is cleansed
from the husk in the <em>támpa</em>. Let him study the writings
<em>Níti Prája</em>, <em>Níti Sastrá</em>, <em>Srúti</em>, <em>Asta Bráta</em> and <em>Jáya
Lángkara</em>; to abandon his vicious habits, never to ill use
his wives, and to be kind and constant to his present wife
(another daughter of the <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>.)"</p>

<p>In a short time the <em>Susúnan</em> died. The <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>,
who was destined to succeed him, excited much disapproba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1198" id="Page_1198">[Vol II Pg 198]</a></span>tion
and disgust by his ungrateful neglect of the customary
rites due to the body of the deceased, and his indecent eagerness
to ascend the throne before it was even vacated. The
practice of the country required him to wash and purify the
corpse with his own hands; but he left the task to the women,
while he shut all the gates of the <em>kráton</em> and seated himself in
front on the <em>setíngel</em>. The deceased was buried at <em>Megíri</em>,
and his widow, <em>Rátu Kanchána</em>, attended the procession, distributing
money as she past along, to the amount of one thousand
dollars and more.</p>

<p>As soon as the body was removed the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>
assembled all his chiefs, and addressed them to the following
effect: "All ye who are present bear witness, that the <em>Pangéran
Adipáti Amángku Nagára</em> has succeeded to the
sovereignty of his late father, <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat</em>, and as
ye acknowledged and respected the father, now do the same
to the son;" to which they all ejaculated assent. To this
<em>Ráden Subráta</em>, who wished to shew his attachment to the
young prince by raising him in the eyes of the people, added,
"the sovereignty descends to you by the will of the Almighty;
it has not been assumed by yourself;" but no one
answered. All the chiefs present, however, approached the
prince and kissed his feet, in proof of their acknowledgment
of his authority. The new <em>Susúnan</em> then declared <em>Rátu
Kanchána</em> his queen, and nominated the principal officers of
state: and as soon as he returned to the <em>dálam</em> addressed
three letters, one to the Governor General of Batavia, one to
the commandant at <em>Japára</em>, and one to the commandant at
<em>Semárang</em>, informing them of his having assumed the sovereignty
in succession to his ancestors. He likewise entrusted
a letter for Batavia, and another for the Governor General, to
the care of Captain Knol at <em>Semárang</em>.</p>

<p>On first granting their support to the deceased prince, the
Dutch required that he should enter into a bond, dated 10th
October 1677, confirming the treaty of the 25th February preceding,
and acknowledging a debt to the Dutch of thirty
thousand dollars, together with three thousand <em>kóyans</em> of rice,
as a security for which he was required to mortgage to the
Dutch all the sea-ports from the river <em>Kráwang</em> to the eastern
extremity of the island. The whole revenues of these places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1199" id="Page_1199">[Vol II Pg 199]</a></span>
including in particular all the rice deliverable to the state,
were also to be received by the Dutch in diminution of this
debt.</p>

<p>At the same time, also, the <em>Susúnan</em> was called upon to
execute a deed of cession, confirming the act of the 28th
February preceding, and setting forth that his father, having
already verbally expressed an intention to make over to the
Dutch his rights on the kingdom of <em>Jákatra</em> (or land lying
between the river of <em>Untúng Jáwa</em> and <em>Kráwang</em> and the
northern and southern sea-coasts), the said grant was further
confirmed, and the whole of the province of <em>Jákatra</em> ceded
accordingly, the inhabitants who wished to remain being
ordered to acknowledge the Dutch as their lawful sovereign,
but all being at liberty to place themselves under the <em>Susúnan</em>
and to leave the Dutch territory, till the expiration of twelve
months after the publication of this act.</p>

<p>By this deed of cession, the <em>Susúnan</em> also ceded to the
Dutch, in acknowledgment of the services rendered by
Admiral Speelman against the rebels, the country between
the <em>Kráwang</em> and <em>Pamanúkan</em> rivers, in a straight line to
the South Sea, with all the immunities and privileges attached
to it.</p>

<p>This document further prohibited the importation of cloths
and opium by any one except the Dutch, and contained the
appointment of <em>Adipáti Mandaráka</em> to be chief of <em>Tegal</em>
and the western, and <em>Aria Urawán</em> to be chief of <em>Jápara</em> and
the eastern sea coast.</p>

<p>On the 15th January 1678, a charter was procured from the
<em>Susúnan</em>, placing the sugar trade of <em>Japára</em> entirely in the
hands of the Dutch. A grant was made them of the management
of the town and jurisdiction of <em>Sámrang</em> and the village of
<em>Kaligwái</em>, that is to say, the right of appointing governors of
their own at those places, without the least interference on
the part of the <em>Susúnan</em>; on condition, however, that the
revenues should be duly accounted for and paid to his highness's
officers by those of the Dutch. But as his highness
was still in debt to the Dutch, those revenues were provisionally
taken in diminution of the debt.</p>

<p>In Bantam the Dutch had made various treaties with the
princes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1200" id="Page_1200">[Vol II Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 17th April 1684 a contract was signed with the
sultan of Bantam, by which it was stipulated, among other
articles, that the contract of the 10th July 1659 should be
renewed and confirmed; that the sultan should give no kind
of assistance to the enemies of the Dutch, and undertake
nothing hostile against their allies, particularly the <em>Susúnan</em>
and the prince of <em>Chéribon</em>; that the <em>Táng'ran</em> river, from its
mouth to its origin, and from thence a line drawn from south
until it meets the South Sea, should be the boundaries fixed
upon between the Dutch jurisdiction and the Bantam
country, it being understood that the whole of the <em>Táng'ran</em>
or <em>Untong Jáwa</em> river, with its mouths, should be the property
of the Dutch, together with six hundred rods of land
to the northward from fort <em>Bábakan</em> to the sea, with liberty
to erect such <em>pággars</em>, or forts, on the western banks of the
river, as should be deemed necessary for purposes of safety;
the inhabitants of the Bantam side to be permitted to fish in
the river, and to appropriate its waters to the purposes of cultivation,
but no vessels to be allowed to enter the river from
the sea without Company's passes; that the claims of the
Dutch on the government of Bantam should be reduced to
twelve thousand rix dollars, or one-eighth of its original
amount; that his highness should give up all claims to the
principality of <em>Chéribon</em>; that the fourth article of the contract
of 1659 should remain in force, and consequently that
no ground or factory rent should be paid by the Dutch, but
that the sultan should give as much ground gratis, as the purposes
of the factory might require; that his highness should
conclude no contracts with other powers contrary to the
present treaty.</p>

<p>On the same day, however, a bond was executed by the
Sultan, in favor of the Dutch, for the payment of the expenses
incurred in assisting his highness against the rebel sultan,
and his friend the British resident, who it is stated in this
document would have received the punishment due to his
conduct but for the interference of the Dutch, to whose protection
he was indebted for the moderation with which his
highness had restricted his punishment to a final removal
from Bantam. This obligation states the sultan's debt to be
six hundred thousand rix-dollars, which he promises to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1201" id="Page_1201">[Vol II Pg 201]</a></span>
either in specie or pepper, or by remission of duties; and he
also grants therein to the Dutch the sole trade in pepper and
cloths, in the countries of <em>Bantam</em>, <em>Lampung</em>, and <em>Silebar</em>.</p>

<p>On the 28th April 1684, a deed was executed, by which the
sultan of Bantam's debt of six hundred thousand rix-dollars
was remitted, on condition that the Company should enjoy the
privileges mentioned in the bond of the 17th instant; but
whenever the above privileges were violated on the sultan's
part, the Dutch held themselves justified in requiring payment
of the debt in question.</p>

<p>On the 15th February 1686, an agreement was entered into
with the sultan of Bantam, by which, among other stipulations,
the Dutch engaged to assist the sultan against his
rebellious subjects, with men, ammunition, and vessels, on
condition that he would pay the expense; it being stipulated
that they should not leave their factory during the night;
that they should not be permitted to walk outside the town
without the sultan's and the Resident's permission; that they
should not enter the houses of the natives, much less stay
there during the night; that they should not take away any
articles in the bazars without duly paying for the same; that
they should not enter any gardens or premises without permission
from the proprietors; that they should not enter any
temples without previous leave; that they should not detain
any females in their houses, nor stop them in the streets; on
meeting the sultan in the streets, that they should shew his
highness the accustomed honours; that they should not stop
whenever the sultan or sultana bathed in the river, but pass
without looking at their highnesses; that they should not
interfere with the disputes and judicial proceedings of the
natives. By the eighteenth article it was mutually agreed,
that offenders, of either party, should be punished according
to their respective laws, and each by his own nation; and
that the whole of the black and white pepper produced at
Bantam should be sold to the Dutch at a fixed price.</p>

<p>On the 4th December 1687, on the occasion of the accession
to the throne of a new sultan of Bantam, an act of
renovation of all former treaties was passed, together with a
renewal of the bond for six hundred thousand dollars, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1202" id="Page_1202">[Vol II Pg 202]</a></span>
the deed remitting the same, on condition that the privileges
heretofore specified were granted to the Dutch at Bantam.</p>

<p>On the 3d March 1691, on occasion of the elevation to the
throne of another sultan, an act of renewal was passed of the
contracts concluded at different periods between the Dutch
and the sultans of Bantam.</p>

<p>On the 6th January 1681 an agreement was signed with the
three chiefs of <em>Chéribon</em>, setting forth the gratitude of those
princes for the signal services rendered them by the Dutch,
and their determination to follow the Dutch Company's
advice under all circumstances, and to assist the Dutch
government whenever their aid might be required, on condition
that they should, in like manner, be assisted by the
Dutch in cases of emergency, each party bearing the expense
of all armaments undertaken for his benefit. The three
princes promised to live upon good terms with the <em>Susúnan</em>.</p>

<p>In the event of one of the three princes, or other persons,
committing any acts prohibited by the present articles, or derogatory
to his highness the <em>Susúnan</em>, it was agreed, that
such conduct should be punished with the utmost severity.</p>

<p>The other stipulations of importance were, that no fortifications
should be erected by the princes without the consent of
the Governor-General, who should have leave to build a factory
at <em>Chéribon</em>, and to cause all species of merchandize to
be imported <em>duty free</em>. That all pepper growing in the kingdom
of <em>Chéribon</em> should be disposed of to the Dutch at the
bazaar price; that the trade in sugar and rice should be free
to all, upon payment of an export duty of two per cent. to the
princes; that vessels belonging to powers at war with the
Dutch should not be permitted to enter the ports of <em>Chéribon</em>,
but be dealt with as enemies.</p>

<p>On the 7th September 1680, another contract was entered
into with the princes of <em>Chéribon</em>, by which all former differences
were declared to be forgotten, and <em>Panambáhan</em>, <em>Chéribon</em>,
and sultan <em>Anom</em>, promised to respect and honour their
elder brother, sultan <em>Sépu</em>, as the first-born of their <em>Panambáhan
Kiái Gíri Láyah</em>. Sultan <em>Sépu</em> promised, on the other
hand, not to slight his brothers in any way, but on the contrary
to treat them, on every occasion, with the deference due<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1203" id="Page_1203">[Vol II Pg 203]</a></span>
to their rank. It was agreed, that there shall be one place
only for holding tournaments, where the royal brothers would
appear every Saturday in their state dresses, attended by their
<em>mántris</em>, and that, to prevent disputes, they should be seated
to the right and left of sultan <em>Sépu</em>, and all the <em>mántris</em>
below; but that, should indisposition prevent one of them
from attending the tournament, they should send due notice
thereof on the Saturday morning. At the tournament the
sultan only had the right to speak; but sultan <em>Sépú</em> not
being present, that right was to devolve on the second, and
in his absence on the third chief. In the event of all the
princes being prevented from attending, the eldest sons of
sultan <em>Sepu</em> and <em>Anom</em> should make their appearance, and
the command devolve on the <em>Pangéran</em>. That in consequence
of frequent disputes having arisen among the princes,
with reference to the appointment and super-cession of prime
minister, the right of nominating to that office was vested exclusively
in the governor-general of Batavia. That in the
event of any difference occurring between the princes, which
they could not adjust themselves, the resident of <em>Chéribon</em>
should be requested to act as arbitrator on the part of the
Dutch. That should one of the princes refuse to comply with
this article, the other brothers should on no account molest
him, but simply report the matter to the Batavian government,
through their ambassadors. The dissenting prince
should, however, in that case, voluntarily place himself in the
resident's custody, who should not be permitted to convey
him out of <em>Chéribon</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Middlekoop mentions, that during the reign of this
prince, the principality of <em>Madúra</em> was conferred by the
<em>Susúnan</em> on <em>Chákra Diníngrat</em>; but the inhabitants of <em>Súmenap</em>
being discontented with this choice, they informed the
<em>Susúnan</em> that they would rather die than submit to that authority;
upon which the <em>Susúnan</em> thought proper to divide
that country into two parts, giving to <em>Chákra Diníngrat</em> the
western district, and the eastern, or <em>Súmenap</em> district, to <em>Mas
Yáng Wúlan</em>, who took the name of <em>Yúdha Nagára</em>. In the
year 1683, the whole island of <em>Madúra</em> revolted, and became
subject to the Dutch government.</p>

<p>But to return to <em>Pangéran Adipáti Amángku Nagára</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1204" id="Page_1204">[Vol II Pg 204]</a></span>
usually called <em>Mangkúrat Más</em>. The authority of this prince
seems to have been attacked almost immediately after his
accession to the throne; for <em>Ráden Súria Kasúma</em>, a son of
the <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>, having accompanied the procession
which attended the body of the late <em>Susúnan</em> to the grave,
persuaded many of the party to declare him sovereign of
Java, under the title of <em>Súnun Panatagáma</em>. The <em>Susúnan
Mangkúrat Mas</em> no sooner heard of this, than he became
highly enraged with his uncle, the <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>, and sent
back to him his daughter, the queen <em>Ratu Kanchána</em>. He
afterwards ordered the <em>Pangéran</em> with his wives and children
into his presence, and commanding them to be seized, publicly
exposed them on the <em>alun alun</em>, in a pen or railing made
for that purpose, which the Javans call <em>betek</em>. <em>Ráden Suria</em>
was apprehended.</p>

<p>On the one hundredth day after the death of the late <em>Susúnan</em>,
the wives of the chiefs being assembled to prepare a
customary feast, intended "to give a blessing to the journey
of the deceased," the <em>Susúnan</em> conceived a passion for <em>Ayu
Pakúwati</em>, the wife of the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Madúra</em>, and availed
himself of his power over her to gratify it. She, however,
soon made her escape, and reported the particulars to her
husband, who in revenge concurred with the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Semárang</em>,
in urging the <em>Pangeran Púgar</em> to assume the sovereignty.
"So large a party," said these chiefs, "being in
favour of your pretensions, you can never be condemned
for assuming the government; for as with men who drink
a bottle of wine, if there are few of them they must necessarily
become intoxicated, but if there are many, truly it is
nothing at all."</p>

<p>Being assured by the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Semárang</em>, that the Dutch
were not cordial friends of the present <em>Susúnan</em>, the <em>Pangéran</em>
was at last prevailed upon to escape with his family and a
chosen band to <em>Semárang</em>, where the Dutch received him,
and conditionally proclaimed him sovereign of Java.</p>

<p>As soon as the <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat Mas</em> was informed of
the departure of the <em>Pangéran</em>, he applied to the commissioners
at <em>Semárang</em> to have him delivered up; but received
for reply an intimation, that he was under the protection of
the Dutch, and that if the <em>Susúnan</em> wanted him he must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1205" id="Page_1205">[Vol II Pg 205]</a></span>
come for him himself. Enraged at this evasion, he ordered
that <em>Ráden Súria Kasúma</em>, the son of the <em>Pangéran</em>, should
immediately be put to death. The young prince was accordingly
brought into his presence for the purpose, when a great
eruption suddenly took place from <em>Merápi</em>, the mountain
emitting a sound louder than thunder, and flame which enlightened
all <em>Kérta Súra</em>. The <em>Susúnan</em>, thinking that his
end was approaching, sent the young king back into confinement,
when the sounds immediately ceased, and the mountain
emitted no more flame. The <em>Susúnan</em> conceiving all danger
at an end, once more ordered the execution of the prince, but
a more violent eruption than the first instantly rent the mountain
asunder. The alarm of the <em>Susúnan</em> was increased, and
considering this was a <em>gáro-gáro</em>, or sign, that the prince was
favoured by the Almighty, he altered his intentions, received
his intended victim into favour, and appointed him a <em>Pangéran</em>,
under the title of <em>Pangéran Ang'ebái Saléring Péken</em>,
with an assignment of one thousand <em>cháchas</em> of land.</p>

<p>He appointed the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Madúra</em>, under the name of
<em>Panambáhan Chakra Níngrat</em>, chief over all the coast districts,
from <em>Brébes</em> to <em>Banyuwángi</em>, and the <em>Tumúng'gung</em> of
<em>Surábaya</em>, under the name of <em>Adipáti Jaeng Rána</em>, to be his
<em>Páteh</em>. To the <em>Tumúng'gung</em> of <em>Semárang</em> he also gave the
title of <em>Adipáti Súra Adimang'gála</em>.</p>

<p>Immediately after his accession he had written to the Dutch
government; but it appears that the letter was not forwarded
from <em>Semárang</em> to Batavia until after the <em>Pangérang Púgar</em>
had taken part against him. According to the Dutch accounts,
the ambassadors of both parties arrived nearly at the
same time at Batavia, were admitted to audience the next
day, and were received, not like ambassadors, but rather as
messengers.</p>

<p>The objections urged by the Dutch to the acknowledgment
of the <em>Susúnan</em> were the following:​&mdash;1st. Because he was a
great tyrant, and well known to have instigated his father to
a rupture with the Dutch, and to have himself menaced hostilities
against them, as soon as he should have mounted the
throne. 2d. Because his embassy did not consist of princes
of his family, and the prime minister, as usual, but of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1206" id="Page_1206">[Vol II Pg 206]</a></span>
common regents only. 3d. Because the letter which communicated
his father's death, and announced his own accession,
although it contained a request for protection against
his enemies, did not apply for their sanction or confirmation,
nor declare his readiness to renew the contracts, to acknowledge
the debts, and to fulfil the engagements formerly stipulated,
though he ought to have known that this was the basis
upon which alone the Dutch could have recognized his title
as sovereign of Java. 4th. Because letters had been intercepted,
in which he invited the prince of <em>Madúra</em> to join him
against the Dutch, calling them his mortal enemies, whom he
intended to expel from the island of Java.</p>

<p>These combined circumstances induced the Dutch government
not to acknowledge him as successor to his father,
although they, with a view to gain time until the arrival of a
fleet expected from Holland with a reinforcement of troops,
wrote to him, merely declining to receive his ambassadors as
such, and requiring him to send others, whose family connections
and rank might entitle them to more consideration,
and with whom they might treat.</p>

<p>After it was arranged that <em>Pangéran Púgar</em> should become
sovereign, the three chief Dutch authorities then at <em>Semárang</em>
waited upon him, to inform him thereof, at the same time requiring
that, in return for the assistance intended to be afforded
him, he should, on assuming the authority, cede to the Dutch
the provinces of <em>Demák</em>, <em>Japára</em>, and <em>Tégal</em>, in compensation
for the expenses they might incur on his account. <em>Pangéran
Púgar</em> feeling no inclination to comply with these conditions,
though anxious to avoid a rupture with the Dutch, proposed,
instead of a cession of territory, that he should become generally
responsible for all the expenses of the war; "for,"
said he, "if it is through the assistance of the Dutch that I
am placed upon the throne, of course it would not be becoming
in me to refuse them any thing they require: but
with respect to this request, is it not better that, at present,
we attend to what is necessary to secure the throne, and
afterwards talk of minor matters? I am willing to pay all
the expenses which it may occasion to the Dutch." With
this the commissioners were satisfied; and the troops having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1207" id="Page_1207">[Vol II Pg 207]</a></span>
arrived from Europe, it was resolved, on the 18th of March,
1704, to place <em>Pangéran Púgar</em> upon the throne, and to
maintain him on it.</p>

<p>The Dutch ships and troops having reached <em>Semárang</em> in
April, and the part they intended to take being now for the
first time manifest to <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat Mas</em>, he dispatched
three messengers to the Dutch representative at <em>Semárang</em>,
with the sum of seventy thousand dollars in specie,
and authority to renew former contracts, and comply with
every requisition which the Dutch might make, provided they
would acknowledge his succession to the throne; but these
messengers had only reached <em>Tínker</em> when they fell in with
the Dutch troops, and were obliged to secure their safety by
flight, leaving the money behind.</p>

<p>The <em>Pangéran Púgar</em> was publicly installed by the Dutch
at <em>Semárang</em><a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> on the 19th of June.</p>

<p>The districts of <em>Demák</em>, <em>Grobógan</em>, <em>Siséla</em>, and all the lands
beyond <em>Semárang</em> as far as <em>Un'gárang</em>, were immediately
taken possession of by the Dutch, and the troops of the <em>Susúnan
Mangkúrat Mas</em>, which had moved towards <em>Semárang</em>,
were forced to retreat on <em>Kerta Súra</em>.</p>

<p>Before the departure of the <em>Pangéran</em>, the Dutch had
again pressed him to cede the provinces of <em>Semárang</em>, <em>Tégal</em>,
and <em>Japára</em>, but by the advice of the <em>Panumbáhan</em> of <em>Madúra</em>
and his principal chiefs, he still refused compliance, and
they were not able to obtain any decided promise from him,
beyond reimbursement for the expenses of the war. When
they were arrived, however, at <em>Ung'árang</em>, the prince happening
to be alone, unattended by any of the <em>Bopáti</em>, the Dutch
commander seized the opportunity which he had been so long
watching for, to assure him how truly and sincerely the Dutch
were inclined to assist him, not only on the present occasion,
but hereafter, whenever he might require their aid. "The
Dutch," added he, "are in great want of rice, and request
your highness will have the kindness to grant them a thousand
<em>koyans</em> (two thousand tons) a year without payment."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1208" id="Page_1208">[Vol II Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>The <em>Pangéran</em> made no reply: he wished for time to
think upon it; but the chiefs of the Dutch came up to him,
and returned him many thanks and compliments for his having
thus, as they said, agreed to their request. The prince,
though he wished to say he had not given his promise, yet
felt ashamed, after the thanks and compliments he had received,
to express what he thought. He therefore bowed his
head and was silent. They then entreated him to draw out
his assent in writing, and to affix his seal to it, as a proof of
his voluntary surrender of the present. With this he complied.</p>

<p>The paper was no sooner obtained, than the Dutch
officers again returned their thanks. They then withdrew,
and the troops being under arms, a salute was fired on the
occasion. When this circumstance came to the ears of the
<em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Semárang</em>, he hastened to the <em>Pangéran</em>, and thus
addressed him, "Be not offended, my prince, if I presume to
open your eyes to the proceedings of these Hollanders,
who are so rapacious in their demands. They had already
consulted with me on the subject of this rice, and they
knew the opinion of your advisers to be against it, they
therefore watched for their opportunity to find you alone.
I little thought you would have taken upon yourself to act
thus, without consulting your chiefs. I imagined the
Dutch were satisfied with the answer I had given them, and
would not have thought of going to you about it." The
<em>Susúnan</em> gave him in return the history of the grant, and promised
faithfully that, if ever they made another request of the
kind, he would send for his advisers immediately.</p>

<p>Before the Dutch moved towards the interior, they contrived
to bribe <em>Jága Diníngrat</em>, the chief who commanded
the <em>Kérta-súra</em> troops, and with his assistance possessed
themselves without difficulty of the fortified stations of <em>Pedak-páyang</em>,
<em>Ung'árang</em>, and <em>Selatíga</em>. The main force of the
<em>Kérta-súra</em> troops, consisting of about forty thousand men,
was encamped in a strong position, not far from the latter
place. After making considerable resistance, they were
obliged to retreat in confusion, and the combined army prosecuting
its march towards the capital, carried <em>Asem</em> by assault,
and reached <em>Kérta-súra</em> shortly after <em>Susúnan Mang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1209" id="Page_1209">[Vol II Pg 209]</a></span>kúrat
Mas</em> had quitted it. All the chiefs who remained submitted
to the new authority, and were received under its protection,
with the exception of the son of <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>,
who was strangled. <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat Mas</em>, called also
<em>Susúnan Pínchang</em>, on account of his lameness, was at this
time about thirty-four years of age. His reign was short, but
remarkable for severity and cruelty.</p>

<p><em>Pangéran Púgar</em> was fifty-six years of age when he ascended
the throne. He had seven legitimate children, <em>Pangéran
Matáran</em>, <em>Ang'ebái Léreng Páser</em> (who had remained
with the deposed <em>Susúnan</em>), <em>Jága Rága</em>, <em>Mángku Nagára</em>,
<em>Mángku Búmi</em> (who was declared hereditary prince, and succeeded
his father), <em>Blítar</em>, and <em>Tepa Séna</em>.</p>

<p>The title assumed by <em>Pangéran Púgar</em>, with the concurrence
of the Dutch, was <em>Susuhúnan Pakabúana Senapáti Ingalága
Abdul Ráchman Panatagáma</em>, which may be rendered "The
saint who is the nail of the empire, the chief commander
in war, the slave of God, and propagator of the true faith."</p>

<p>An occurrence which took place shortly after the assumption
of the government by this prince is noticed by the Javan
writers, and argued highly in favour of the justice and impartiality
of this prince.</p>

<p>The wife of <em>Mérta Yúdha</em>, writer to the <em>Susúnan</em>, and
nephew of the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Semárang</em>, presented herself before
him, alleging that her life was endangered by the cruel treatment
of her husband, and imploring that she might be divorced
from him, or protected against his ill usage. The <em>Susúnan</em>
inquiring into the particulars, ascertained from the testimony
of the woman herself, that she was attached to <em>Pangéran
Adipáti</em>, the son of the <em>Susúnan</em>, who had frequently visited
at her house in the absence of her husband, and that the severities
she had suffered were the consequence of the rage
which a discovery of that fact had occasioned. He called
upon the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em> to say if it was correct; and the
prince, being ashamed to tell a falsehood, acknowledged the
fact: wherefore his father reproved him in the strongest
terms, and cautioned him not to be guilty of a like transgression
a second time. Then calling for <em>Mérta Yúdha</em>, he thus
addressed him: "<em>Mérta Yúdha</em>, your wife has come to me
requesting my interference to procure her a divorce from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1210" id="Page_1210">[Vol II Pg 210]</a></span>
you, or that I should prohibit you from again ill-treating
her in the same severe manner you have before done, on account
of her attachment to my son, the <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em>."
To which <em>Mérta Yúdha</em> replied, "Respecting this affair, allow
me to explain. She committed an offence towards me,
and she now comes to you to complain of me, saying I had
beaten her until she was nearly dead. That I did beat her
is true, but that I did so until she was nearly dead is utterly
false. I beat her when I was enraged; but, as my anger
subsided, I quickly became kind to her again; and yet she
has the audacity to request a divorce. This completes three
offences; in the first place, she committed the fault; in the
second, she has told a falsehood; and in the third, she has
requested a divorce. These points I submit to the justice
of your majesty." The <em>Susúnan</em> then reflected that as the
<em>Pangéran Adipáti's</em> conduct had been the cause of this woman's
offence, it would not be just to punish her, without
also punishing his son; and being disinclined to be severe with
him on account of his youth, he felt at a loss how to decide
with justice. At length, seeing but one way to get rid of
the difficulty, he thus addressed <em>Mérta Yúdha</em>: "Enough,
<em>Mérta Yúdha</em>; the fault rests with my son the <em>Pangéran
Adipáti</em>, and your wife cannot be condemned to punishment,
unless my son be also condemned. Now I have not
the power to condemn my son, on account of his youth;
therefore, I publicly request your pardon for my son's offence.
If you wish to be divorced, the permission is granted,
and I will provide you with another wife. You want her
immediately​&mdash;it is well;​&mdash;but I have no women at present
except my own, none but the <em>Rátu</em> and my own daughters.
Make your choice, and whichever you prefer of them, I
will present to you in marriage. Place your confidence in
what I say, and believe that I say no more than what I
will do."</p>

<p><em>Mérta Yúdha</em>, struck with astonishment, knew not how to
reply. At last, after bowing his head several times to the
ground, he declared that he was overcome by this act of magnanimity;
that he forgave the young prince from his heart, and
would willingly receive his wife back again, and treat her with
kindness. The <em>Susúnan</em> then dismissed the parties, giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1211" id="Page_1211">[Vol II Pg 211]</a></span>
them advice as to their future conduct, and presenting them
with a sum of money and several rich presents. <em>Mérta
Yúdha</em> and his wife, say the Javan writers, afterwards lived
most happily together, and never ceased to praise the justice
and magnanimity of the prince.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1705, the Dutch government again sent a
force to <em>Semárang</em>, which was joined by seven thousand
Madurese, under the command of <em>Panambáhan Chákra
Diníngrat</em>.</p>

<p>At this time <em>Surapáti</em>, who, after his first arrival at <em>Matárem</em>,
had offered to surrender, again made an application
to the Dutch for protection, and offered to send six thousand
auxiliaries, promising at the same time to conduct himself as
a faithful subject; but his offer was rejected.</p>

<p>On the 5th October, 1705, a contract was entered into by
the new sovereign with the Dutch, by which, 1st, the contracts
of the 24th September, 1640, and 20th October, 1677,
and all privileges and immunities granted by <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat
Mas</em> to Messrs. Speelman and Cooper, were confirmed.
2d. His highness ceded to the Dutch the district of <em>Gebáng</em> as
situated within the following boundaries; viz. "From the
mouth of the <em>Dónan</em>, on the southern shore, in a westerly direction
along its banks as far as <em>Pasúruan</em>, where there is an
inland lake; thence along the north-eastern sea-shore to the
mouth of the river <em>Che-brom</em>, and further on along the north-eastern
side of an accessible swamp to <em>Che-satia</em>, near the
village <em>Madúra</em>, thence in a north-easterly direction over the
mountains of <em>Dáyu-luhur</em> to mount <em>Sumána</em> or <em>Subáng</em>, and
then south-east over the mountains of <em>Bonkok</em>, where a northerly
direction is taken, and continued to the river <em>Losári</em>,
and further on along the banks of that river to its mouth on
the northern coast of the island." 3d. The <em>Susúnan</em> acknowledged
<em>Chéribon</em> as an independent state, in consequence of
that country having, in 1680, been saved by the Dutch from
the ravages of a banditti. 4th. The <em>Susúnan</em> resigned to the
protection of the Dutch the countries of <em>Súmenap</em> and <em>Pamakásan</em>,
stated to have been forced on them during the
reign of <em>Susúnan Tegál-arom</em>, by the chief <em>Yúdha Nagára</em>.
5th. The <em>Susúnan</em> renewed and confirmed the cession of <em>Semárang</em>
and <em>Kaligawé</em>, as stated in the transfer of 15th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1212" id="Page_1212">[Vol II Pg 212]</a></span>
January, 1678. He further ceded to the Dutch the ports of
<em>Torbáyá</em> and <em>Gumúlak</em>, on condition that the tolls continued
to be collected for his own benefit, as at <em>Sámárang</em>. The
Dutch, on the other hand, agreed to restore about fifty villages
which belonged to <em>Demák</em> and <em>Kaligáwe</em>.</p>

<p>It was agreed that the tolls on goods imported into, or exported
from, the <em>Susúnan's</em> dominions by the Dutch, should
be levied according to the above-mentioned contract of 25th
February, 1677, and that the <em>Susúnan</em> should in future require
a duty of three instead of two per cent. from individuals
trading with Dutch passes, it being left to his highness to fix
the duties to be levied on goods belonging to persons who
were not furnished with licences from the Dutch. 7th. The
Dutch obtained liberty to establish factories in every part of
the <em>Susúnan's</em> dominions, for which sufficient lots of vacant
ground were to be given them, to answer every purpose of
safety and convenience, and also to establish yards for building
vessels. The Javan chiefs were bound to supply the
Dutch at all times, payment being made for the same, with
timber, labourers, &amp;c. but they were to pay no capitation, and
only to be considered as Company's subjects, as long as they
should be employed by the Company. 8th. His highness
promised to supply the Dutch with as much rice as should be
required, at the market price, the Dutch being also at liberty
to purchase that article from his highness's subjects, who were
also allowed to export rice to Batavia, and all countries at
peace with the Dutch. 9th. Pursuant to the contract of 1677,
the <em>Susúnan</em> agreed to continue to shut his ports against
<em>Makásars</em>, <em>Búgis</em>, <em>Maláyus</em>, <em>Bálians</em>, and other foreigners,
except such as should obtain the permission of the Dutch.
10th. It was agreed that the Dutch, and all persons authorized
by them, should continue to enjoy the exclusive privilege of
importing and selling opium and clothes, as granted to them
by <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat</em>, on the 20th October, 1677: that the
native chiefs should carefully prevent all encroachments on
this monopoly, and that all seizures of prohibited goods made
by them and by the Company's servants, should be for the
profit of his highness, to whose discretion it was left to remunerate
the officers making the seizure. 11th. That all
seizures made at sea by the Company's cruizers should be for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1213" id="Page_1213">[Vol II Pg 213]</a></span>
the sole benefit of the captors, although afterwards brought
into his highness's ports. 12th. The <em>Susúnan's</em> subjects
were to be prohibited from trading otherwise than with Company's
passes, and their trade eastward was restricted to <em>Bálí</em>
and <em>Lómbok</em>, northward to Borneo and <em>Banjarmásin</em>, and
westward to <em>Bantám</em>, <em>Lámpung</em>, <em>Jámbi</em>, <em>Indragíri</em>, <em>Johór</em> and
<em>Malácca</em>. They were prohibited from visiting the eastern governments,
or <em>Búton</em>, <em>Tímor</em>, <em>Bíma</em>, &amp;c., on pain of confiscation
of vessels, cargo, &amp;c. It was declared, that whenever his
highness should be desirous of sending vessels to these quarters
on his own account, the Dutch should attend to his
wishes, as far as might be consistent with their regulations.
13th. The balance remaining due to the Dutch of the debts
of his highness, adverted to in the contracts of 25th February
and 15th October, 1677, was remitted, together with the sum
to be paid to Captain Jonker for the delivery of the rebel
<em>Trúna Jáya</em>, and all other claims of the Dutch on his highness,
for expenses incurred in re-establishing him on the
throne, &amp;c. on the express condition that this contract should
be faithfully observed; otherwise the said claims and pretensions
to retain their former validity. In consideration of this
important remission, his highness promised to supply the
Company during twenty-five years, commencing in 1706, with
eight hundred lasts of good rice annually, deliverable at Batavia
by his highness's own vessels. An article was afterwards
added to this treaty, by which it was stipulated, that no
other European nation than the Dutch should ever be permitted
to trade or build factories on Java.</p>

<p>On the 11th October, 1705<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>, a further agreement was entered
into by his highness, by which he promised to bear the
expense of keeping a detachment of two hundred men of the
Dutch troops at <em>Kérta-súra</em>, for his highness's protection and
security, amounting to thirteen hundred Spanish dollars per
month.</p>

<p>On the 12th July, 1706, a treaty for determining the boundaries
between the territories of the <em>Susúnan</em> and those of the
Dutch was entered into.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1214" id="Page_1214">[Vol II Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<p>The deposed prince, <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat Mas</em>, after flying
from his capital, proceeded to the eastern districts, and joining
<em>Surapáti</em>, reduced the eastern provinces under their
authority, and appeared confident of success, being possessed
of immense treasures in specie and jewels, which he had
carried off with him.</p>

<p>In 1706, however, the army of <em>Surapáti</em> was defeated by
the allied Dutch and Javan forces, and <em>Kedíri</em> was taken.
Subsequently, the large combined army of <em>Mangkúrat Mas</em>
and <em>Surapáti</em> was put to the rout and dispersed. <em>Surapáti</em>
shortly after died in the mountains of <em>Bángil</em>, according to
some accounts, of the effect of his wounds. He was succeeded
in office by his son, <em>Pangáting</em>, who took the name of
<em>Adipáti Wíra Nagára</em>, and being allied by marriage to the
chiefs of <em>Kedíri</em>, <em>Balambáng'an</em>, and <em>Grésik</em>, brought many
of the eastern districts again to acknowledge the authority of
<em>Mangkúrat Mas</em>. Additional forces were, in consequence,
sent from Batavia by the Dutch, which arrived at <em>Semárang</em>
in 1707, and immediately proceeded, first to <em>Kérta-súra</em>, and
then to the eastward. Falling in with the enemy of <em>Mádion</em>,
they put him to flight, and continued their march to <em>Surabáya</em>,
where the disturbances which had broken out on the
island of <em>Madúra</em> obliged them to halt.</p>

<p>On the death of the native chief of <em>Madúra</em> his eldest
natural son, <em>Sástra Nagára</em>, had declared himself his successor,
and placed troops round the island to oppose the
landing of his uncle, <em>Ráden Súria Nagára</em>, who had been
appointed to the succession by the Dutch. The Dutch, however,
found means to satisfy both parties, by conferring the
separate charge of <em>Sámpang</em> on <em>Sástra Nagára</em>.</p>

<p>At <em>Súmenap</em> they met with greater difficulty. The native
chief, <em>Nága Sidérma</em>, had been stabbed by his secretary: the
secretary was afterwards killed by the slave of the chief. A
tumult was thus excited, and the Dutch commanding officer
having given offence to the principal inhabitants they proceeded
with a large proportion of the population to the
northern part of the island. The Dutch at length succeeded
in establishing the infant son of the deceased as chief of <em>Súmenap</em>,
with the title of <em>Ráden Tumúng'gung Príng'ga Ka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1215" id="Page_1215">[Vol II Pg 215]</a></span>súma</em>,
under the guardianship of his mother, <em>Rátu Sidáyu</em>.
With these proceedings the campaign closed for that year<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>.</p>

<p>In the following year, 1708, the Dutch sent further reinforcements
to the eastward, and preparations were making for
opening the campaign, when the fugitive <em>Susúnan</em>, hearing
of the arrival of the Dutch at <em>Surabáya</em>, sent ambassadors to
their representative (Knol,) soliciting his pardon, and an assignment
of some lands, independent of any other authority
than that of the Dutch government. No sooner had he been
promised this than he came to <em>Surabáya</em>, where he was received
on the 17th July by Knol, who delivered to him a
letter of pardon written in the Dutch and Javan languages,
promising to him the independent possession of a district as
a principality, subordinate only to the Dutch government.
But, alas! these concessions were soon found to be nothing
more than a stratagem to get possession of the prince's person.
The unfortunate <em>Susúnan</em>, unsuspicious of the treachery, was
quietly embarked at <em>Surabáya</em> on the 24th August, and with
his three sons, his wife, concubines, and attendants, conveyed
to Batavia.</p>

<p>The Dutch accounts relate, that as soon as the prince arrived
at Batavia, the commissioners, who had received him on board
and accompanied him to the castle, demanded that he should
deliver up his <em>kris</em> before being admitted to an audience,
which he refused to do. When, however, introduced to the
high regency, who had been especially assembled for his reception,
he prostrated himself at the feet of the governor-general,
surrendered his <em>kris</em>, and implored the fulfilment of
the conditions on which he surrendered. The governor-general
replied, that Mr. Knol had not been authorized either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1216" id="Page_1216">[Vol II Pg 216]</a></span>
to grant him a pardon or to make promises, yet that government
would take the matter into consideration: his <em>krís</em> was
then returned to him. He was lodged in the castle as a prisoner
of war, and soon afterwards transported to Ceylon.</p>

<p>The account of this transaction by the Javan writers is as
follows:</p>

<p>"The <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat Mas</em> and the <em>Adipáti Wíra
Nagára</em> (son of <em>Surapáti</em>) had not been long at <em>Málang</em>
before they were attacked by <em>Pangéran Blítar</em>, and forced
to seek safety in the forests with only a few followers.
There they suffered severely from disease; and most of
them dying, the rest removed to the land of <em>Blítar</em>, whence
the <em>Susúnan</em> sent a letter to the chief Dutch authority at
<em>Surabáya</em>, asking him why the Dutch had thus assisted the
<em>Pangéran Púgar</em> against him, and deprived him of the
sceptre which had descended to him from his ancestors,
adding that he was himself equally the friend of the Dutch,
that he had never harboured a thought injurious to them, and
that if they still believed that he had been guilty of a fault
against them, it would be well if they would point it out
that he might exert his utmost to make amends: for this
they might fully depend on him; 'therefore,' said he, 'let
the Dutch place confidence in me, let them consider my
youth, and that it is yet but a short time that I have been
a sovereign.' To this the Dutch authority replied, 'If
the <em>Susúnan</em> wishes to act thus, and his intentions are
good, let him come to <em>Surabáya</em>.' <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat</em>
then requested, that if the Dutch would not again place him
on the throne, they would assign him a province, in which
he and his family might reside in peace. A promise being
given to that effect he immediately proceeded to <em>Surabáya</em>,
where he was received with all honours and the customary
salutes, and afterwards entertained with the Dutch officers
in the <em>Passangráhan</em> of the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Surabáya</em>. The
Dutch authority at last said to him, with the utmost kindness
and softness of speech, 'If the <em>Susúnan</em> has no objection,
I am anxious that we should go to <em>Semárang</em> to see
the commissary; from thence the <em>Susúnan</em> can at once
proceed to <em>Kérta-súra</em>, and request the Dutch again to
acknowledge him as sovereign of Java.' The <em>Susúnan</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1217" id="Page_1217">[Vol II Pg 217]</a></span>
immediately assented to this arrangement. He was then,
with his family and followers, embarked on board a ship;
but instead of being conveyed to <em>Semárang</em>, he was taken
to Batavia, and afterwards banished to Ceylon."</p>

<p>It appears, that after the arrival of <em>Mangkúrat Mas</em> at
Ceylon he found means to dispatch letters of complaint to the
prince of Orange and the Court of Directors in Holland. Two
Mahomedan priests were charged with the mission, but the
letters being intercepted, the messengers were subjected to
severe punishment.</p>

<p>With <em>Mangkúrat Mas</em> was lost the celebrated <em>makóta</em>, or
crown of <em>Majapáhit</em>. The regalia of the sovereigns of Java,
with the exception of this important article, were duly delivered
over, by order of the Dutch, to the acknowledged sovereign
<em>Pakabúana</em>, but nothing more was ever heard of the
crown, and since that time, the princes have worn a <em>cap</em>, as
described in another place. As the Dutch were now become
supreme on Java, a crown was perhaps but an empty pageant.
It cannot, however, escape notice, that this proud ornament
of state should first have been deprived of its brightest jewel,
and afterwards, as there is too much room to suspect, filched
by the Dutch, who probably stripped it of its remaining
jewels, and melted down the gold for its value!</p>

<p>The removal of <em>Mangkúrat Mas</em> did not, however, extinguish
the flame of internal discord which still blazed forth in
the eastern provinces of Java, and which increased till the
year 1712-13. The <em>Susúnan</em> sent several embassies to Batavia,
requesting assistance against the chiefs of <em>Balambángan</em>
and of the island of <em>Madúra</em>, as well as against the sons of
<em>Surapáti</em>, who had their hiding places in the mountains. On
this occasion the Dutch sanctioned the nomination of the
<em>Pangéran Mángku Nagára</em> as the hereditary prince, and promised
the required succours against the rebels, but took care
to point out the value which they put upon their assistance:
a piece of policy which, on no occasion, they seem to have
forgotten. They adverted to the immense sums they had at
different times advanced, and the extent of the obligations
which the <em>Susúnan</em> lay under to them, admonishing him to
act with greater circumspection in future, and to adopt such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1218" id="Page_1218">[Vol II Pg 218]</a></span>
measures as might put a stop to the civil wars and commotions
which desolated the country.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before various circumstances concurred
to render the rebels still more formidable. The chiefs
of <em>Surabáya</em>, <em>Probolíng'o</em>, and <em>Kédíri</em>, as well as those of
<em>Madúra</em> and <em>Balambáng'an</em>, united at the instigation of the
chief of <em>Wináng'un</em> (whose life had been unjustly attacked,)
in a league to shake off the yoke of the <em>Susúnan</em>, and at the
same time to rid themselves of the Dutch, whose aim they
conceived to have been eventually to depose the <em>Susúnan</em>,
and to render themselves sovereigns of the whole island.</p>

<p>A circumstance is related by the native writers, which is
said to have contributed essentially to the distractions which
at that time existed in the country.</p>

<p>"The Dutch requested that the <em>Susúnan</em> would immediately
put the <em>Adipáti Jaíng Rána</em> of <em>Surabáya</em> to death,
alleging that he was attached to the cause of the rebels, and
that if an example were made of this chief, it would strike
fear into the others. On this the <em>Susúnan</em> became excessively
grieved at heart, for he was sincerely attached to the
<em>Adipáti</em>; and now that the <em>Panambáhan</em> of <em>Madúra</em>, who
had been as his right hand, was dead, if he were to lose the
<em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Surabáya</em> also, who had been as his left hand,
he would in truth find that he had lost both hands. He
wished, therefore, to refuse compliance with this request;
but at the same time feared, that if he disappointed the
Dutch, there would be an end of his friendship with them.
On these two accounts he gave the subject his deepest consideration.
At length he wrote a letter to the <em>Adipáti</em>, informing
him of the request made by the Dutch; and to the
Dutch at Batavia he wrote in reply, that he wished to reflect
upon the affair, until the time appointed for the chief to pay
his usual visit to the capital should arrive.</p>

<p>"As soon as the <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Surabáya</em> received these
tidings he assembled his brothers and his <em>Páteh</em>, named
<em>Wíra Tantáha</em>, and showed them the letter. His brothers
immediately advised that they should unite and oppose any
one, whoever it might be, who should attempt the life of
the <em>Adipáti</em>; for, said they, 'Is it not better to die nobly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1219" id="Page_1219">[Vol II Pg 219]</a></span>
'in war, and to let one's enemies know how dearly the
death of our brother is to be purchased, than to be quietly
killed in one's bed? will only know of the death and
not of its value.' But the <em>Páteh</em> replied to them, 'What
you say is correct, and in the service of the state we are
bound to act as you advise; but this is a request made by
the general, that the <em>Adipáti</em> should be put to death. Is
it not better that he should deliver himself up? for if he
does not there will be a rupture between the general and
the <em>Susúnan</em>, and then (which God forbid) the land of
<em>Jáwa</em> will be destroyed, and universal misery will follow.
You have now, for a long time, enjoyed happiness and a
good name, and now that you have grown old in honour,
it would not be fitting in you to do any thing that could
bring sorrow or ruin on your sovereign, or that would disgrace
your followers or descendants, which would be the
case if you now got a bad name.' The <em>Adipáti</em> was well
pleased with the advice of his <em>Páteh</em>, and after considering
for a short time, then addressed him, 'What you say is
true, oh <em>Páteh</em>! I am old, and have not long to live. It
is indeed right that I should deliver up my life for the
benefit of my sovereign and the character of my family.'"</p>

<p>This resolution being taken, the <em>Adipáti</em> shortly after set out
for <em>Kértasúra</em>, accompanied by his brother and about two
thousand followers. When he arrived, the <em>Susúnan</em> inquired
how he wished to act; to which he replied, that he preferred
to die rather than to be the cause of misfortune to his sovereign
or to the people of Java; that he was now old; that if
his life was spared on this occasion he could not expect to live
many years, and that he was already satisfied with this world.
The <em>Susúnan</em> then said, if such was his determination and
wish, he must of course follow it, but urged him to speak his
mind freely, adding that he would think of it, and do what
would turn out best for him: but the <em>Adipáti</em> replied, that he
had no other wish than what he had already expressed; that
it was much better that he should die, than become the cause
of misfortune to others. All he requested was, that after his
death the <em>Susúnan</em> would not be forgetful of his family and
children, and that until his son was of a proper age, his brother,
<em>Ráden Jáya Puspíta</em>, might succeed him in his public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1220" id="Page_1220">[Vol II Pg 220]</a></span>
administration. The <em>Susúnan</em> then said, "It is well. If the
Dutch again make the demand you must prepare for your
fate; and I promise you that, in that case, your request shall
be complied with." At the expiration of about a month,
during which period the <em>Adipáti</em> clothed himself in white and
gave himself up entirely to his devotions, another letter arrived
from the Governor General, making a peremptory demand
that the <em>Adipáti</em> should be immediately executed. The
<em>Susúnan</em> then sent for the <em>Adipáti</em>, and directed that he should
be brought into the <em>dálam</em>. Dressed in white, he immediately
attended the summons. When he reached the entrance
<em>sri meng'ánti</em>, he quitted his followers, who were not allowed
to come further but remained without; and the people who
guarded the entrance of the <em>kráton</em>, having received the
orders of the <em>Susúnan</em> to that effect, seized him, and
plunging their weapons into his body, immediately dispatched
him. They then carried out the corpse and gave it to
his followers, charging them to give it proper burial. They
were all struck with deep grief at the sight, for the <em>Adipáti</em> was
much beloved. They interred the body at <em>Lawéan</em>, but immediately
afterwards the brother, with about two thousand followers,
assembled in the <em>alun alun</em>, determined upon vengeance,
and the disturbance was not quelled until the <em>Susunán</em>
entered into an explanation. He then appointed <em>Jáya
Puspíta</em> to succeed provisionally to the administration of his
deceased brother, and otherwise conciliated the parties, who
were at last induced quietly to return to <em>Surabáya</em>; not, however,
without a determination of one day being revenged on
the authors of this calamity. On receiving the appointment
from the <em>Susúnan</em>, while <em>Jáyá Puspíta</em> returned their grateful
acknowledgments for this mark of kindness, they as openly
avowed that they would never rest in peace, until they had
given a due return to whoever was the cause of their brother's
death.</p>

<p>"In pursuance of this determination, <em>Jáya Puspíta</em> took an
early occasion to league with other discontented chiefs, and
soon became the most formidable enemy to the tranquillity of
the country.</p>

<p>"The forces of the <em>Susúnan</em> were completely defeated in
a pitched battle, and the rebels made themselves masters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1221" id="Page_1221">[Vol II Pg 221]</a></span>
several important provinces to the eastward of <em>Pasúruan</em>,
which place they also besieged until the arrival of the Dutch
auxiliaries. They were then driven beyond <em>Panarúkan</em>; but
being reinforced from <em>Báli</em>, soon forced the combined Dutch
and Javan troops to retreat again to <em>Pasúruan</em>."</p>

<p>The effect of this civil war was now severely felt at Batavia.
The country was laid waste, cultivation was neglected,
and a great scarcity of rice was felt at Batavia. This induced
the Dutch to march a more considerable force in 1717, and
again to take an active part in re-establishing the tranquillity
of the country.</p>

<p>On the arrival of this force at <em>Madúra</em>, it was found that
the chief of that island had made two unsuccessful attacks on
the troops of <em>Pamakásan</em> and <em>Súmenap</em>, and been forced at
last to leave his capital with his son, brother, wives, and relations,
and seek safety with the Dutch.</p>

<p>"When <em>Pangéran Chákra Deníngrat</em>," say the Javan
authors, "saw that nothing more was to be done against his
enemies," he resolved to throw himself on the protection of the
Dutch; and a Dutch ship arriving at <em>Madúra</em> he dispatched
a letter, soliciting their assistance. This letter the captain
forwarded to <em>Surabáya</em>, and received the instructions of the
admiral to take the chief and his family on board, and convey
them to that capital. The captain immediately sent a messenger
on shore to the <em>Pangéran</em>, informing him of the wishes
of the admiral, and inviting him to come on board with his
family. <em>Pangéran Chákra Deníngrat</em>, who was unconscious
of treachery or duplicity, and consequently void of suspicion,
with a joyful heart accepted the invitation, and, accompanied
by his family, immediately went off in a small fishing-boat.
When arrived alongside of the ship, the followers who carried
the <em>upachára</em> (emblems of state) were ordered to go on board:
after them the <em>Pangéran</em> himself ascended, and then his wife,
<em>Ráden Ayu Chákra Diníngrat</em>. When the <em>Pangéran</em> came
upon deck, Captain Curtis took him by the hand, and delivered
him over to one of his officers, who immediately led
him into the cabin. The captain remained till the <em>Ráden
Ayu</em> had ascended, and as soon as she came on deck he likewise
took her by the hand, and after the European manner
kissed her cheek. Not understanding the custom she became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1222" id="Page_1222">[Vol II Pg 222]</a></span>
alarmed, and thinking that Captain Curtis was offering an insult
to her, screamed out, and called aloud upon her husband,
saying, "the Captain had evil intentions." The <em>Pangéran</em>
hearing the cries of his wife became furious, and drawing his
<em>kris</em> rushed out, and without further inquiry stabbed the Captain.
The attendants of the chief, who had come on board
with the state ornaments, following the example of their master,
raised the cry of <em>amók</em> and immediately fell on the crew
of the vessel. The latter, however, were too powerful for
them, and in a short time the whole of the Madurese party
were killed, together with the chief and his wife.</p>

<p>When a question arises respecting the chastity of the Javan
women, this story is usually referred to.</p>

<p>The rebels, both in the eastern provinces of Java and on
<em>Madúra</em>, were joined by auxiliaries from <em>Báli</em>. Those, however,
on <em>Madúra</em> were soon overmatched by the Dutch
troops, and obliged to fly again to <em>Báli</em>. <em>Jáya Puspíta</em> was
more successful. Moving from <em>Surabáya</em> through the central
districts towards <em>Kérta-súra</em>, he subjected the provinces of
<em>Jápan</em>, <em>Wírasába</em>, <em>Kedíri</em>, <em>Mádion Sukawáti</em> and the neighbouring
districts. While his head quarters were at <em>Kedíri</em>,
he was joined by <em>Pangéran Dípa Nagára</em> one of the sons of
the <em>Susúnan</em>, who setting himself up as sovereign of Java,
under the title of <em>Panambáhan Héru Chákra Senapáti Panatagáma</em>
appointed <em>Jáya Púspita</em> to be his <em>Páteh</em>, with the
title of <em>Ráden Adipáti Panatagáma</em>, and commenced the
establishment of a government at <em>Mádion</em>.</p>

<p>An army was sent from <em>Kérta-súra</em> against <em>Mádion</em>, under
the command of <em>Pangéran Blítar</em>, another son of the <em>Susúnan</em>;
but before they reached that place the <em>Pangéran</em> was
summoned to return, in consequence of the severe indisposition
of his father. This prince died in the Javan year 1648,
and was buried at <em>Megíri</em>. He had previously written to the
Dutch authorities, requesting them to select one of his three
sons <em>Pangéran Adipáti Amángku-nagára</em>, <em>Pangéran Purbáyá</em>,
or <em>Pangéran Blítar</em>, to succeed him in the government.</p>

<p>Thus ended the reign of a prince, which had been one
constant scene of commotion and rebellion, directed perhaps
not so much against the authority of the prince himself, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1223" id="Page_1223">[Vol II Pg 223]</a></span>
against the Dutch, who now took so active a part in the
affairs of Java, that the power of the native sovereign was
merely nominal.</p>

<p>The Javan writers, whether from a desire to exclude from
the regal line a prince who thus became the mere puppet of
the Europeans, or from a conviction of the truth of the circumstance,
seem anxious to prove that he was not the real
son of <em>Susúnan Tegál Arom</em>, as related, but a son of the
<em>Pangéran Kajuran</em>, father-in-law of <em>Trúna Jáya</em>, and who
afterwards, when he established himself in the southern hills,
took the name of <em>Panambáhan Ráma</em>. The story runs, that
the <em>Rátu</em> of <em>Mangkúrat</em> being delivered of a deformed and
imperfect offspring, the <em>Susúnan</em> secretly sent the child to
<em>Kajúran</em>, who was supposed to deal in witchcraft, and that
the <em>Pangéran</em> took the opportunity of destroying it, and substituted
his own child in its place. This child, however, was
born of a daughter of <em>Pangéran Purbaya</em>, the younger brother
of Sultan <em>Agong</em>; so that on the mother's side it was of
royal extraction. "But," say the Javan writers, "as the
present princes of Java are descendants from <em>Pakubuána</em>,
this story is not talked of in public; although in private
societies there are many who put faith in it."</p>

<p>On the 13th of December, 1705, articles were agreed upon
with the Sultan of Bantam, to ensure the weight and quality
of the pepper to be delivered.</p>

<p>On the 9th of October, 1708, a further contract was entered
into with the sultan, with the view principally of renewing
and confirming the contracts, bonds, deeds of remission, &amp;c.,
entered into and concluded with his predecessors.</p>

<p>In August, 1731, another contract was entered into with the
sultan, of which the following were the most interesting
articles.</p>

<p>That all Búgis, Maláyus, Javans, and other native traders,
shall be allowed freely to dispose of their wares at Bantam,
without any interference on the part of the Dutch Resident,
provided they do not trade in articles which constitute the
Company's monopoly. The subjects of Bantam shall be permitted
to trade to Java on condition that they do not abuse
the confidence thus placed in them by engaging in illicit commerce.
The sultan promised to adopt immediate measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1224" id="Page_1224">[Vol II Pg 224]</a></span>
for increasing the annual deliveries of pepper to the Company,
and engaged to hold out every possible inducement to
the <em>Lámpung</em> people to extend the cultivation of the article,
instead of depressing them by unnecessary acts of severity.
A deed was also executed about this time ceding <em>Púlo Pánjang</em>
to the Dutch, for the purpose of keeping an establishment
on it for assisting vessels in distress.</p>

<p>On the 9th December, 1733, a further contract was entered
into with the sultan of Bantam, by which many regulations
were made respecting the pepper monopoly.</p>

<p>Being called upon to renew the bond for the sum of six
hundred thousand Spanish dollars in favour of the Dutch, the
sultan, after previously stating whence this <em>lawful</em> debt originated,
bound his kingdom and revenues for the same, and
at the same time conferred on the Dutch the exclusive trade
in pepper and other privileges. The deed of remission, bearing
date 28th April, 1684, was further renewed, by which a
conditional remission of the above-mentioned bond was
granted. An act of donation from the price of ground,
called <em>kámpung báli</em>, was at the same time granted.</p>

<p>Of the three sons of the deceased <em>Susúnan</em>, the Dutch
government made choice of the <em>Pangéran Adipáti Amángku
Nagára</em>, as his successor; he was accordingly publicly installed,
under the title of <em>Susûhunan Prábu Senapáti Ingalága
Abdul Ráchman Sahídin Panatagáma</em>.</p>

<p>The first and principal event in this reign was the rebellion
of the younger brothers of the prince, <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em> and
<em>Blítar</em>, occasioned principally by their being deprived of the
lands and honours which they had enjoyed during the lifetime
of their father. They first raised a party in the capital,
and made an attempt, during the night, to enter the <em>kráton</em>
and put the <em>Susúnan</em> to death, but being repulsed, they fled
to <em>Matárem</em>, and collecting their followers, the youngest
(<em>Blítar</em>) assumed the title of <em>Súltan Ibni Mustápha Pakubúana
Senapáti Ingalága Abdul Ráchman Patagáma</em>. His
brother, <em>Purbáya</em>, was satisfied with a secondary authority,
under the title of <em>Panambáhan Senapáti Ingalága</em>.</p>

<p>In a short time the provinces of <em>Bányumas</em>, <em>Matárem</em>, and
<em>Kedú</em>, submitted to these chiefs, and a union taking place
with the party under <em>Panambáhan Héru Chákra</em>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1225" id="Page_1225">[Vol II Pg 225]</a></span>
authority of the newly elected <em>Susúnan</em> became endangered.</p>

<p><em>Pangéran Aria Matárem</em>, uncle of the <em>Susúnan</em>, at the
same time quitted <em>Kérta Súra</em>, and reared the standard of
rebellion in <em>Grobógan</em> and <em>Blóra</em>. This chief was, however,
soon after decoyed into the hands of the Dutch in the following
manner.</p>

<p>"The <em>Pangéran</em> was induced to go to <em>Páti</em>, and afterwards
to <em>Japára</em>, on an understanding that the Dutch would
raise him to the throne, where troops were immediately
assembled, apparently for that object, but in reality to secure
his person. On his arrival at the fort with his family, he was
received with salutes of cannon and small arms, and separated
from his followers, who were excluded. After he had
been seated a short time, the gates of the fort were shut, and
the <em>Pangéran</em> and his sons were disarmed, and placed in
close confinement. He died in a few days. When the gates
of the forts were closed, the followers of the <em>Pangéran</em> suspecting
the treachery, would not disperse, until many were
destroyed and the rest fired upon."</p>

<p>The Dutch force uniting with those of the <em>Susúnan</em>, the
rebels, who were now united under the sultan <em>Ibni Mustápha</em>,
were defeated, and obliged to retreat to <em>Kedíri</em>. Here they
were pursued, again beaten, and driven in disorder to <em>Málang</em>.
The sultan fled to <em>Gúnung Dampúlan</em> with only a
few followers, while <em>Panambáhan Senapáti</em> and <em>Panambáhan
Héru Chákra</em> rallied their remaining forces at <em>Lamájang</em>.
The Dutch army now returned to <em>Kérta Súra</em>, and the
tranquillity of the country was once more for a short time
restored.</p>

<p><em>Sultan Ibni Mustápha</em> having returned to the village of
<em>Káli Gángsa</em>, was seized with a violent illness and died, and
his family and followers, worn out with fatigue, conveyed the
body to <em>Kérta Súra</em>, and threw themselves on the mercy of
the <em>Susúnan</em>. Notwithstanding this unconditional submission,
their chief, <em>Jáya Bráta</em>, was immediately put to death, and
his body thrown into the river: the body of the deceased
sultan, however, received honourable interment.</p>

<p>The rebels established at <em>Lamájang</em> still held out, and it
was not until the arrival of a considerable Dutch force at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1226" id="Page_1226">[Vol II Pg 226]</a></span>
<em>Surabáya</em> that they were induced to submit. According to
the native writers, "The Dutch commander wrote from
<em>Surabáya</em> to the rebel chiefs at <em>Lamájang</em>, informing them
that he had been ordered to the eastward with a formidable
force purposely to destroy them, and that if they did not
quietly submit, he would force them to do so, in which case
no quarter should be given, adding at the same time, that if
they were willing to submit quietly, they should be received
with favour, treated with kindness, and want for nothing
during their lives. The chiefs seeing no prospect of success
from further opposition, were induced to close with these
terms. Accordingly <em>Panambákan Senápati</em> and <em>Héru Chákra</em>,
with <em>Adipáti Náta Púra</em>, attended by only a few followers,
surrendered themselves at <em>Surabáya</em>, where they were received
with great honour, the firing of cannon and musketry,
and by the sound of the <em>gámelan</em>, which struck up on their
approach. It was not long, however, before their persons
were placed in confinement, and they were embarked on
board a ship from Batavia, from whence <em>Panambáhan Héru
Chákra</em> and <em>Adipáti Náta Púra</em> were afterwards banished to
the Cape."</p>

<p>The only circumstance from which the peace of the country
appears to have been subsequently disturbed during the reign
of this prince, was by a kráman, or rebel, named <em>Ráden
Ibráhim</em>, who gave himself out as a descendant of <em>Surapáti</em>;
but this movement was instantly suppressed, and all that
arose out of it appears to have been an attempt on the life of
the <em>Susúnan</em>, made by a woman, who with a small party
endeavoured to force her way into the <em>kráton</em>, but with several
of her followers was killed in the attempt. The authority of
the prince was now fully established; and in return for the
services rendered by the Dutch in the late war, he was
required to enter into a new treaty with the Dutch, containing
the following, among other less interesting stipulations.</p>

<p>In acknowledgment of the services lately rendered, and
also to his highness's forefathers, and in consideration of the
considerable quantity of rice still owing by him to the Dutch,
on the deliveries stipulated by the contract of 1705, his highness
now promised to deliver to the Company annually at
Batavia, with his own vessels, for a period of fifty years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1227" id="Page_1227">[Vol II Pg 227]</a></span>
to commence from the year 1734, a quantity of one thousand
<em>koyans</em> of good rice, or its equivalent in money, it being
at the same time understood that the Dutch are not bound to
take money for any proportion of the said annual delivery,
except when it was sufficiently proved that a failure of the
crop of rice rendered it impossible to supply the whole
quantity.</p>

<p>That with the view to encourage the cultivation of pepper,
the Dutch should, in future, pay five rix-dollars for each
<em>píkul</em> of that article; while, on the other hand, the <em>Susúnan</em>
engaged to issue an edict, directing the total annihilation of
the coffee culture, with the exception of a few plantations
near the houses of the regents, for their own amusement and
consumption, but by no means for trade, on severe penalties.
The <em>Susúnan</em> moreover authorized the Dutch to cause all
plantations, without distinction, in the low countries, on the
coast, or in the mountains, to be destroyed, and to confiscate,
for their joint profit, any quantity of coffee which might be
found, for purposes of trade, in the hands of any of his
highness's subjects, at the expiration of six months from the
date thereof. That his highness should direct the coast
regents to deliver, in the year 1734, the annual quantity of
timber for repairing and extending the forts of <em>Semárang</em> and
<em>Japára</em>, the other materials being furnished by the Company.
The seventh article stipulated for the delivering annually
about ten thousand beams of teak timber (specified) at <em>Japára</em>,
<em>Demák</em>, <em>Walíri</em>, and <em>Brébes</em>, the same to be duly paid for
on delivery; and the Dutch engaged to assure themselves
that the regulation should be complied with, by causing the
residents of the timber places to transmit the receipts and
other vouchers relative thereto, while, on the other hand, the
<em>Susúnan</em> promised to take care that the timber should be of
good quality and of the stipulated dimensions.</p>

<p>The Dutch remitted to the <em>Susúnan</em> the arrears on account
of the quantity of rice (the delivery of which was stipulated
by the contract of October, 1705), consisting of no less than
6,537 <em>koyans</em>; and also the sums advanced by them in the
wars and during his minority, on condition that, on the part
of the <em>Susúnan</em>, all previous treaties, deeds, and charters,
contracted and granted by his highness's predecessors, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1228" id="Page_1228">[Vol II Pg 228]</a></span>
be fulfilled by him; in default whereof the above pretensions
were to regain their full force and value. It was further
agreed that the Dutch should remain in possession of their
former commercial privileges at Java, his highness promising
to render the Dutch trade still more flourishing and considerable,
and to increase the deliveries of cotton thread. His
highness further bound himself to supply every day two
hundred and forty <em>báturs</em>, or Javan labourers, for the service
of the fort, free of expense to the Dutch.</p>

<p>The act which closed the reign of this prince, and which
affords good evidence of the undisturbed state of public affairs
at the period, was a visit to the burial-place at <em>Bútah</em>, where
<em>Kiái Agong Bútuh</em>, and sultan <em>Pájang</em> had been interred.
The Javans have such a superstitious veneration for this spot,
that they declare it is never overflowed, notwithstanding the
waters rise to a considerable height round it, and that it is
lower than the adjoining ground. Here the prince was taken
ill, and after a long confinement died, in the Javan year 1657.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son, under the title of <em>Susúnan
Pakubuána Senapáti Ingalága Abdul Ráchman Sáhedin
Panatagáma</em>, who ascended the throne when he was only
about fourteen years old, and was yet unmarried.</p>

<p>The young prince was entirely under the superintendance
of <em>Dánu Réja</em>, his father's prime minister, until, as he attained
maturity, he by repeated acts shewed a disposition to shake
off the controul of that chief. He was desirous of appointing
<em>Chákra Níngrat</em> to be <em>Widána</em> of the eastern districts of <em>Pasúruan</em>,
<em>Bángil</em>, and <em>Probolíng'o</em>; but that chief being on bad
terms with the minister <em>Dánu Réja</em>, the <em>Susúnan</em> privately,
and without the knowledge of the minister, wrote to the Governor-general
at Batavia, requesting his sanction to the
measure. Shortly after this the <em>Susúnan</em> made a further application
to the Dutch, that they would remove from Java
the person of <em>Pangéran Ria Mángku Nagára</em>, on a plea that
he had been discovered in an improper intimacy with one of
his concubines. On this occasion the minister, <em>Dánu Réja</em>,
was dispatched to Batavia; and the interview he had with
the Governor-general is thus related by the native writers:​&mdash;"The
General was displeased with <em>Dánu Réja</em>, because he
had not adjusted these two affairs; and afterwards, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1229" id="Page_1229">[Vol II Pg 229]</a></span>
went to Batavia with presents from the <em>Susúnan</em>, the General
asked him if he was willing that <em>Chákra Níngrat</em> should be
<em>Widána</em> of the three districts? <em>Dánu Réja</em>, not aware of the
application made by the <em>Susúnan</em>, replied, that if that chief
was entrusted with so extensive an authority he should
tremble, as the heart of <em>Chákra Níngrat</em> would thereupon
become great; for he had already been married to the <em>Susúnan's</em>
sister. The General observed, that it was easy to remove
this uneasiness from his mind. 'Let,' said he,'this
chief be under the authority of the Dutch only. Let him
pay the money tribute to the <em>Susúnan</em>, but in other respects
let not the <em>Susúnan</em> trouble himself about him. Let him
look to the Dutch only for keeping him under due restraint.'
To this <em>Dánu Réja</em> replied, 'If such is the wish of the
General, I cannot follow it, because I fear that hereafter
the <em>Susúnan</em> would object to such an arrangement, and,
repenting of having followed the General's advice, would
be justly enraged against me and my successors, for having
in any way consented that <em>Chákra Níngrat</em>, or these lands,
should be placed under the immediate authority of the
Dutch.' A pause then ensued. At length the General
resumed, and in a peremptory and angry manner demanded
of the minister, why he had not prevented the <em>Susúnan</em> from
applying for the banishment of his brother, <em>Ria Mángku
Nagára</em>, observing that it had not yet been proved, that he
was guilty of any offence against the <em>Susúnan</em>. <em>Dánu Réja</em>
replied, 'The offence of the <em>Pangéran</em> is clear and decided;
it is known to many that he had an attachment for the
<em>Susúnan's</em> concubine.' He therefore requested he might be
banished the island, adding, that he would request the <em>Susúnan</em>
to make a proper provision for his maintenance. The
General conceiving that <em>Dánu Réja</em> was not inclined to follow
his wishes, became enraged, and desired him not to trouble
himself further about the <em>Pangéran</em>, saying that, whether he
was banished or not, was not his business; it depended entirely
on the government. He then dismissed him to his <em>póndok</em>,
where the minister was allowed to remain upwards of a
year, until the death of the General, when, on the elevation
of his successor, he was directed to return to <em>Kérta-súra</em>.
While thus detained at Batavia, he was repeatedly visited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1230" id="Page_1230">[Vol II Pg 230]</a></span>
some of the counsellors, urging him to accede to the wish of
the General respecting the lands; but he continued to use to
them the same arguments he had before used to the General."</p>

<p>After the return of <em>Dánu Réja</em> to <em>Kérta-súra</em>, he is represented
as having had an interview with <em>Wangsarána</em>, a celebrated
devotee, who resided in the first <em>Kalángbrit</em>, and who
foretold the misfortunes which were to ensue.</p>

<p>On demanding of this <em>tápa</em> what would be the future fate of
<em>Kérta-súra</em>, he replied, "that it was destined to misfortune,
destruction, and sorrow: <em>Ráden Más Sujána</em> and <em>Ráden
Mas Sáyed</em> will however profit by it." This <em>Ráden Sujána</em>
was a younger brother of the <em>Susúnan</em> by a concubine, and
afterwards took the name of <em>Pangéran Mangkubúmi</em>. <em>Ráden
Mas Sáyed</em> was a cousin to the <em>Susúnan</em>, son of his elder
brother, <em>Pangéran Mangku-nagára</em>, who had been sent to
Batavia with a request that he might be banished. They
were both at this time youngest children (<em>timur</em>).</p>

<p>This prophecy made a deep impression on the mind of the
minister; and his uneasiness became still greater, when one
day a woman, named <em>Niái Súka Wáti</em>, came to him from her
mistress, <em>Rátu Agong</em>, the mother of the <em>Susúnan</em>, saying that
the <em>Rátu</em> had just dreamt that she beheld the moon descend
from the heavens and rest on the top of the large <em>dúku</em> tree in
the <em>kráton</em>; and that this had no sooner occurred, than that
<em>Ráden Mas Sujána</em> immediately came, and seizing hold of
the moon swallowed one-half of it, the other half slipping
from his grasp, and resuming its place on the top of the tree:
the <em>Rátu</em> then awoke and found it daylight. These were the
first signs of what was soon to befal <em>Kérta-súra</em>.</p>

<p>The fate of the minister was, however, to be first decided;
for on the occasion of the <em>Susúnan</em> raising a chief, named
<em>Súra-Diníngrat</em>, to be <em>Bopáti of Pakalúngan</em>, with a thousand
<em>cháchas</em>, without the knowledge of the minister, the
latter refused to acknowledge him in that capacity; in consequence
of which the <em>Susúnan</em> requested the Dutch to arrest
him, and banish him from the island. As soon as the Dutch
had consented to do so, the unfortunate minister was dispatched
to <em>Semárang</em> on a special embassy from his master,
where he was decoyed into the Dutch fort and confined. He
was soon after embarked for Ceylon, in the same vessel which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1231" id="Page_1231">[Vol II Pg 231]</a></span>
conveyed <em>Pangéran Ria Mángku Nagára</em>, at whose feet he
fell, acknowledging the justice of his own punishment, for
having assisted in the banishment of that chief, who had in
fact committed no fault. The <em>Susúnan</em> then appointed <em>Nátu
Kasúma</em> to be his minister.</p>

<p>Accounts were now received from Ceylon of the death of
the ex-<em>Susúnan Mangkúrat Mas</em>, and at the request of the
<em>Susúnan</em>, the family of the deceased were permitted to return
to <em>Kérta-súra</em>. On these were conferred distinguished titles
and considerable assignments of land. To <em>Mángku Nagára</em>
the <em>Susúnan</em> gave the name of <em>Wíra Mengála</em>, with one
thousand <em>cháchas</em> of land; to <em>Mángku Níngrat</em> he gave the
name of <em>Pangéran Tépa Sána</em>, with nine hundred <em>cháchas</em>;
and to <em>Ráden Jáya Kasúma</em> he gave the title of <em>Pangéran</em>,
with three hundred <em>cháchas</em>. <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em>, who had
assumed the title of <em>Panambáhan Senapáti Ingalága</em>, shortly
after died at Batavia, and his body was conveyed to <em>Megíri</em>.
The eldest son of this chief married a younger sister of the
<em>Susúnan</em>, and received the title of <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em>, with
an assignment of <em>sáwa</em>. The <em>Susúnan</em> became much attached
to him, and at length followed his counsel in all things.
"What was right was declared wrong, and what was wrong,
right, just as he pleased, and the <em>Susúnan</em> believed it."</p>

<p>This increasing influence of the <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em> alarmed
the minister, who secretly acquainted the Dutch with it, and
by their interference the <em>Pangéran Purbáya</em> was removed
from the councils of the prince, and obliged to fix his residence
at a distance from the capital.</p>

<p>Various signs now foreboded approaching war and misfortune,
and led the people to expect that <em>Pangéran Tépa Sána</em>
would attempt to regain the throne of his ancestors. The
<em>Susúnan</em> and his ministers entirely disregarded these signs;
but <em>Pangéran Wíra Mengála</em> sought the friendship of the
Dutch commandant, in the hope of obtaining his assistance.</p>

<p>At this time occurred the rebellion of the Chinese at Batavia;
and as the Dutch accounts of the transaction are far
from complete or satisfactory, I shall quote two Javan records
without variation. One of them is as follows:</p>

<p>"The city of Batavia was now in the highest state of
prosperity: traders came from all quarters, merchandize was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1232" id="Page_1232">[Vol II Pg 232]</a></span>
in abundance, and the slaves were numerous. The latter becoming
arrogant, in consequence of the wealth and power of
their masters, committed outrages on the Chinese, in the first
instance by beating them, and afterwards by attempting their
lives. At first there were but few who committed these outrages,
but at last they formed themselves into parties and
committed more public acts of hostility. The Chinese applied
to the European officers in authority, to put a stop to these
outrages, or to punish those who committed them: they could,
however, obtain no redress, the slaves testifying with one
accord that the Chinese were the aggressors. The Chinese
finding they could not obtain justice from the great people,
assembled near the sugar mills at <em>Gandária</em><a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>, to the number
of more than a thousand, and chose a chief, with the determination
to oppose the Dutch and the slaves; but as yet they
thought it advisable not to do so openly, and therefore committed
their depredations in small parties during the night.
The Dutch, as soon as they heard of this, empowered several
natives from <em>Sábrany</em> (of the opposite coasts and islands) to
take up the Chinese who were at <em>Gandária</em>; these people
succeeded in apprehending the Chinese one by one, and as
soon as they gave them over to punishment they received a
reward of six ducatoons for each. In this way they secured
about two hundred. These were immediately embarked on a
vessel to be banished to another country, but when they had
got out to sea they were all thrown overboard. Many of them
who could not swim perished; but a few having succeeded in
reaching the shore, found their way to <em>Gandária</em>, and related
to their companions how they had been treated. The Chinese,
upon this, concluding that the Dutch had resolved to extirpate
their race, now openly prepared their warlike instruments,
gave notice to their countrymen at Batavia of the manner in
which the Dutch had determined to destroy them, and requested
that those who were willing to join them would immediately
repair to <em>Gandária</em>. The Chinese in other quarters,
equally harassed by the slaves, against whom they could
gain no redress, became of one mind, when they received the
intelligence of their countrymen having been thrown overboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1233" id="Page_1233">[Vol II Pg 233]</a></span>by the Dutch, and when they reflected that the destruction
of their race was determined; they therefore collected
quietly at <em>Gandária</em>, until their numbers amounted to upwards
of five thousand. Here the whole placed themselves
under the orders of a chief, named <em>Sípanjang</em>."</p>

<p>The other account is as follows:</p>

<p>"It is related of Batavia, that General Valkenier was excessively
liberal in his favours to the Chinese. The consequence
of this was, that of all the races then resident at Batavia,
with the exception of the Dutch, none were so wealthy
as they. Whatever was profitable fell into their hands, while
the other races, the natives of the country and the adjacent
islands established there, found it difficult to discharge the
duties and demands made upon them. On this account all
these races became discontented with the Chinese; and as it
is usual with the latter for their hearts to swell as they grow
richer, quarrels ensued, and disputes continually took place
between the parties. These increased, until complaints were
carried before masters of slaves, where slaves were concerned,
and before the regular courts, where free people were concerned.
But the Chinese being always defeated in these
suits, and fined for their conduct, they assembled in bands,
for the purpose of revenging themselves, and began to plunder
the villages in the neighbourhood of the town. This happened
in the Javan year 1663 (<em>gúna-rása-móbah jalma</em>)<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>.</p>

<p>"It is related that at this time there was at Batavia a certain
<em>Edel Heer</em>, the Baron Van Imhoff, who had arrived from
Ceylon. On his arrival at <em>Jokarta</em>, he learned from General
Valkenier the particulars of the conduct of the Chinese, who
were thus committing depredations in the villages; he said
there were too many Chinese at Batavia, and proposed that a
proportion should be sent to Ceylon. This was accordingly
agreed to by the high council, and a search was in consequence
made to take up the poorest of these, that they might
be transported to Ceylon. The expences, in the first instance,
were to be advanced by the Dutch, who were afterwards to
be reimbursed when the Chinese should have acquired the
means at Ceylon. The Chinese captain was accordingly directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1234" id="Page_1234">[Vol II Pg 234]</a></span>
to beat the <em>gong</em>, and give public notice of this order;
but there was not one Chinese inclined to follow it: and in
order to carry the proposition of Van Imhoff into effect, it was
agreed to arrest all the Poor Chinese. This order was given
to the captain of the Chinese, but he declined to arrest his
countrymen. Van Imhoff then inquired by what distinction
of dress he might know the rich from the poor? The captain
replied, "the clothing of the Chinese which may be considered
a proof of their being poor, is black (blue)." Upon
this the governor directed the <em>Baillieu</em> to arrest all Chinese so
dressed; and the <em>Baillieu</em> again entrusting the execution of
this order to his <em>Máta Máta</em>, who belonged to the races inimical
to the Chinese, the latter, to gratify particular enmities,
arrested many who did not wear blue, some of them of the
most respectable families. The Chinese, in general, were
much offended, when shortly the whole of those who were
arrested, were embarked on board ship apparently for Ceylon;
but they had been only a few days at sea, when they were
<em>amók'd</em>. Most of them were killed, and the rest were thrown
overboard. Of these some escaped to land, and arriving secretly
at Batavia, communicated to their countrymen the particulars
of the cruel treatment of the Company towards them.
On this all the chiefs of the Chinese entered into an agreement
to raise the standard of rebellion against the Dutch,
and to endeavour to carry the fort of Batavia. There were,
however, one or two who did not chuse to become the enemies
of the Dutch.</p>

<p>"A Chinese named <em>Liu Chu</em>, informed the government of
what was going on among his countrymen, for which he received
a reward of eighty ducats, and other valuable presents,
with a promise of future patronage. This man went as a spy
to the Chinese at <em>Gandária</em>, and endeavoured to persuade the
chief to submit to the Dutch, promising him free pardon; but
<em>Si-pánjang</em> suspecting that, however fair might be the promises
of the Dutch in the first instance, they would not fail
to revenge themselves upon him, by seeking out some offence
of which to accuse him, would not listen to these overtures.
The Dutch then ordered, that of the Chinese who were at
Batavia, such as wished to join their countrymen at <em>Gandária</em>
might do so, but that such as wished to follow the Dutch, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1235" id="Page_1235">[Vol II Pg 235]</a></span>
shave their mustaches as a sign, and deliver up all their sharp
instruments of every description, even to the smallest knife,
and neither burn a lamp nor make a fire at night. All the
Chinese within the city were inclined rather to remain in
their houses, and conform to the wish of the Dutch according
to this order, than to quit their houses and join their companions
at <em>Gandária</em>. The Dutch troops were now making
preparations in the fort, and shut the gates of the city, hearing
that the Chinese from <em>Gandária</em> were approaching. These
came towards Batavia in three parties, burning and laying
waste every thing in their way, until they arrived close under
the walls, in numbers not less than ten thousand. Some of
the guns being inefficient, the Chinese became bolder, and
made a furious attack in which they were repulsed with great
slaughter. In this affair the Chinese are estimated to have
lost one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine lives. They
retreated in confusion, but assembled again at <em>Gáding Meláti</em>.</p>

<p>"The next morning the Dutch landed all the sailors from
the shipping in the roads, and having confined the Chinese
to their houses, according to the regulation, the Dutch government
gave orders for their own people, the free black inhabitants,
and the native Christians belonging to the fort, to
slay all the male Chinese, old and young, who were within
the city. Of these, amounting to nearly nine thousand souls,
only one hundred and fifty escaped to join their countrymen
at <em>Kámpung Meláti</em>. The property of all the Chinese was
seized by those who committed the slaughter, not one of
whom was killed, the Chinese having previously, as before
related, delivered up their weapons to the Dutch.</p>

<p>"After this the Dutch troops, to the number of eight hundred
Europeans and two thousand natives, under the orders
of the Baron Van Imhoff, proceeded to <em>Kámpung Gáding
Meláti</em>, where the Chinese under <em>Si-Panjang</em> had entrenched
themselves in considerable numbers, and soon drove them
from this position. The Chinese then retreated to <em>Paning'-gáran</em>,
where also they were defeated. The loss of the latter
affair was on the part of the Dutch four hundred and fifty, on
that of the Chinese eight hundred."</p>

<p>While these transactions were going on at Batavia, many
of the <em>Bopátis</em> of the coast provinces had arrived at <em>Kérta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1236" id="Page_1236">[Vol II Pg 236]</a></span>
Súra</em>, to present themselves at court, according to custom,
at the ensuing <em>múlud</em>. The <em>Bopáti</em> of <em>Demák</em> informed the
minister, <em>Nála Kasúma</em>, that before he quitted his district,
the Chinese, in considerable numbers, had assembled in arms
and elected a chief of their own nation, named <em>Síngseh</em>. The
<em>Bopáti</em> of <em>Grobógan</em> also reported, that the same thing had
taken place in his district, in consequence of their having
heard that the Dutch at Batavia were determined to destroy
every Chinese on the island. On this the minister waited
upon the <em>Susúnan</em>, and informed him of these commotions.
The <em>Susúnan</em> replied, that he had already heard of what was
going on at Batavia, and was much surprized that the general
had not sent him any intimation of the insurrection. The
<em>Ráden Adipáti</em> observed, that perhaps it would not come to
any thing, and that very probably the disturbance would subside
of itself. To this the <em>Susúnan</em> replied: "if so, it was
well; but if the war was brought into his country, what was
he to do? He feared this was to be apprehended, or why
should the Chinese on his lands be thus preparing to defend
themselves against the Dutch. It is proper at any rate,"
added the <em>Susúnan</em>, "that we should agree with all the
<em>Bopátis</em> who were assembled, whether it would be most advisable
to assist the Dutch or the Chinese, for if the war is
to be brought into my country, it appears to me that this
point must soon be determined. In the mean time should
this event happen, let them fight between themselves, don't
let us interfere or assist: don't drive the Chinese away."
On this the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> observed, "that if the general requested
their assistance, they were bound, according to
treaty, to afford it." The <em>Susúnan</em> replied, "if the general
requests assistance from me in men, it is an easy matter,
and we can readily chuse the right course, but he must not
force me to render assistance." The <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> then
said, "as this was the wish of the prince, he would assemble
the chiefs and be ready to give assistance to the Dutch,
should they request it." The <em>Susúnan</em> replied, "very well,
let them agree how to act."</p>

<p>The <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> then proceeded to his house, where,
assembling the chiefs, the point was discussed as follows.
The <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> having informed them of the desire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1237" id="Page_1237">[Vol II Pg 237]</a></span>
the <em>Susúnan</em>, that they should agree how to act, in the event
of the war between the Chinese and Dutch being brought
into the <em>Susúnan's</em> country, whether they should assist the
Dutch or the Chinese. The <em>Adipáti</em> of <em>Pakalóng'an</em>, <em>Jáya
Níngrat</em>, first delivered his sentiments. "I think it is best,"
said he, "that the <em>Susúnan</em> should assist the Dutch, but on
condition they should release him from all the burthens
which have been imposed upon his ancestors." The <em>Ráden
Adipáti</em> said, "That is good; but I must remain of opinion,
that the Chinese who are on Java do not concern our
affairs as to the Dutch: they are not under my orders;
they are only engaged in trade; they have done good, and
brought profit to Java: why must we assist the Dutch, and
destroy the Chinese?" <em>Depáti Jáya Nígrat</em> replied, "It
is true the Chinese do not interfere with our business, and
it is our own fault that we have any thing to do with the
Dutch. Is it not better to take this opportunity of ridding
the <em>Susúnan</em> of the exactions he is under to the Dutch?
Let us assist them; they are strongest. The Dutch are as
iron, the Chinese as tin: therefore it is better to assist the
party most likely to be victorious." The <em>Ráden Adipáti</em>
observed, "that it was on account of the Dutch being so
strong that he thought it wrong to assist them; for," added
he, "if we do they will only become more powerful and great,
when perhaps we shall not be able to oppose them, and
must remain entirely at their mercy. Is it not better, therefore,
to destroy their strength while they are not too powerful
for us?" The <em>Depáti Jáya Níngrat</em> then said, "If on
this account we do not like to assist the Dutch, let us not
assist the Chinese, but remain neutral, and leave them to
fight it out among themselves." The <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> said,
"That would not be according to the will of the <em>Susúnan</em>:
he wishes to take part with one or the other, and he only
asks which." The other <em>Bopátis</em> inclined to the advice of
<em>Jáya Níngrat</em>; but observing the desire of the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em>
to assist the Chinese, were silent, concluding that the
part he took was in conformity with the wish of the <em>Susúnan</em>.
The <em>Tumúng'gung</em> of <em>Grobogán</em>, <em>Ráden Mérta Púra</em>, then
said, "We are as the people who bear two burthens: the
Dutch are on the right shoulder, the Chinese on the left;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1238" id="Page_1238">[Vol II Pg 238]</a></span>
if we throw off one the other still remains. If we can accomplish
it, why should we not get rid of both? In the first
instance, let us assist the Chinese, and get rid of the
Dutch; when that is done we can easily get rid of the
Chinese also." <em>Depáti Jáya Ningrat</em> replied, "It is very
well for you to wish this, but perhaps you are not sufficiently
strong to effect it. In an affair of this importance
we should consider the consequences. If we succeed, it is
well; but if we destroy one party we commit an offence
against the Almighty: what then if we destroy both parties,
who have done us no harm? You must have read in
history what has happened in the land of Java, and what
occurred to those who injured others who did not offend
them. Recollect, for instance, the case of <em>Jaing Rána</em> of
<em>Surabáya</em>, who was put to death unjustly: was his death
not avenged, and for this one innocent life was there not
afterwards a retribution of sixteen lives?" <em>Mérta Púra</em> was
embarrassed, and knew not what answer to make. The <em>Ráden
Adipáti</em> laughed, and was followed by all the chiefs; he afterwards
said, "This is the effect of experience. <em>Mérta Púra</em>
is a young man, and not able to contend in argument with
<em>Adipáti Jáya Níngrat</em>, his elder." However, <em>Ráden Mérta
Púra</em>, taking a cup of tea, recollected himself, and prepared
to reply. After drinking the tea, and replacing the cup, he
immediately addressed <em>Adipáti Jáya Níngrat</em>: "How can
you talk thus? Is it not better to finish the business at
once, and not by halves? Of what use is it to talk of precedents?
What was the case formerly is one thing; the
present affair is altogether different: they cannot be compared
together. We have now our own master, whose
wishes we must follow. We must make a new example,
and leave others to act up to it." The <em>Ráden Adipáti</em> then
demanded of all the other <em>Bopátis</em> their opinion in this affair,
to which they replied, "Let us advise the <em>Susúnan</em> to follow
his own inclination, either to assist the Dutch according to
treaty, on condition that they cancel all obligations, &amp;c. on
the part of the <em>Susúnan</em> to the Dutch, or to assist the
Chinese in destroying the Dutch, and after that to get rid of
the Chinese altogether, or allow them to remain, as the
<em>Susúnan</em> may think proper."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1239" id="Page_1239">[Vol II Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>This opinion was on the next day carried to the <em>Susúnan</em>
by the <em>Ráden Adipáti</em>, who further suggested, that it would
be well to encourage the Chinese to act against the Dutch;
that when the war took place it would be easy to perceive
which was the best side to assist, and that the <em>Susúnan</em> should
appear to remain neutral for the present. The <em>Susúnan</em>
having listened to this advice approved of it. He in consequence
directed that <em>Mérta Púra</em> should quietly return to his
province, and should encourage the Chinese to act against
the Dutch, and promise them, that in the event of their success
the <em>Susúnan</em> would join them. He also directed that
the other <em>Bopátis</em> should make preparations for collecting
their forces.</p>

<p>In pursuance of these orders <em>Mérta Púra</em> secretly proceeded
to <em>Grobógan</em>, and communicated with the chiefs who
had been elected by the Chinese, named <em>Inchi Máchan</em> and
<em>Múda Tik</em>. The Chinese of <em>Grobógan</em> immediately wrote to
<em>Síngseh</em>, the chief at <em>Tánjung Welakan</em>, who was equally
pleased with this promise of support. The Chinese from
<em>Grobógan</em> then went and joined those at <em>Tánjung Walákan</em>,
it being arranged that <em>Mérta Púra</em> should make a sham
attack upon them, from which they should appear to fly.</p>

<p><em>Mérta Púra</em> then wrote to the Dutch commander at <em>Semárang</em>,
telling him that he had orders from the minister to attack
the Chinese, and requesting to be supplied with ammunition,
which was immediately sent. The Dutch were completely
deceived. They furnished <em>Mérta Púra</em> with twenty muskets,
eight carbines and eight pistols, and eight barrels of powder:
they also sent thirty Dutch soldiers. <em>Mérta Púra</em> commenced
the attack before they came, and thus secured the retreat of
the Chinese. On this occasion he shot three horses with ball,
and shewed them to the Dutch as having been wounded under
him.</p>

<p>In the mean time the commandant at <em>Semárang</em>, deceived
by the assurances of <em>Mérta Púra</em>, requested the officers at
<em>Kérta Súra</em> to call upon the <em>Susúnan</em> for assistance. He
directed that <em>Mértu Púra</em> should be reinforced, but that the
chief who commanded the party should receive secret instructions
not to annoy the Chinese in earnest, but to act as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1240" id="Page_1240">[Vol II Pg 240]</a></span>
<em>Mérta Púra</em> had done. With respect to the Chinese at
<em>Kérta Púra</em>, he directed that they should be informed that
on the next morning the Javans would make a sham attack
upon them, when they must retreat and join a party of
Chinese assembled at the <em>Désa Sarója</em> in <em>Kedú</em>, to which
place they would be pursued, and from whence the Javan
chief was to return, saying, that on account of their numbers
he could advance no further.</p>

<p>Secret orders to this effect were immediately given to all
the chiefs. The <em>Adipátis</em> of <em>Páti</em>, <em>Demák</em>, and <em>Kedú</em> were
at the same time directed to go and make a false attack upon
the Chinese at <em>Tánjung Waláhan</em>, and afterwards to retreat
to <em>Semárang</em>, as if beaten, in order that the commander might
believe that the <em>Susúnan</em> was determined to assist the Dutch.</p>

<p>The captain and lieutenant of the Chinese at <em>Semárang</em>
having been put in confinement by the commandant, all the
Chinese at that place joined their countrymen at <em>Tánjung
Waláhan</em>. The Chinese then moved to <em>Kárang Anyer</em>, where
they were attacked. The Javans retreated to <em>Semárang</em>, and
were assisted by the Dutch. The chief, <em>Síngseh</em>, in concert
with <em>Mérta Púra</em>, now laid siege to <em>Semárang</em>.</p>

<p>The commander at <em>Kérta Súra</em> requested assistance against
the Chinese at <em>Ambaráwa</em>, which was granted, with the same
instruction to the chiefs as in the former instances. These
marched as far as <em>Salíatga</em>, where they held secret communication
with the Chinese; but the chief, <em>Aria Pringaláya</em>,
caused ten Chinese to be put to death while both parties
were about to meet privately, and sent the ten heads to <em>Kérta
Súra</em>, which were delivered to the commandant. This at first
exasperated the Chinese leader at <em>Semárang</em>, but he was
soon pacified.</p>

<p>At this time the <em>Susúnan</em> discovered that one of the sons
of <em>Mangkúrat Mas</em>, <em>Tépa Sána</em>, was carrying on an intrigue
with the commandant of the fort at <em>Kérta Súra</em>, and caused
him to be bow-stringed. <em>Wíra Méja</em> and <em>Ráden Garendi</em>,
the two sons of <em>Tépa Sána</em>, with his other relations, joined
<em>Pangéran Wíra Meng'ala</em>, and quitted <em>Kérta Súra</em>: they
were well received by the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Chinese, besides laying siege to <em>Semárang</em>, had also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1241" id="Page_1241">[Vol II Pg 241]</a></span>
by this time taken and destroyed <em>Rémbang</em>. <em>Jawána</em> and
<em>Demák</em> were abandoned by the Dutch troops, and a want of
provisions was felt through the country.</p>

<p>Affairs had come to this pass, when the <em>Susúnan</em> resolved
to massacre the Dutch garrison at <em>Kérta Súra</em>. The Javans
were collected under the fort, as by order from the <em>Susúnan</em>,
in readiness to march against the Chinese, when one of them
who had entered within the walls fired a shot. The cry of
<em>amók</em> was given, and many lives were lost on both sides; but
the plan did not succeed, and it was not till after he was reinforced
by the Chinese that he could effect his object. On the
renewal of the attack, the garrison was compelled to surrender.
The commanding officer and some others were barbarously
murdered in cold blood; the rest of the troops, with their
wives and children, made prisoners, and distributed among
the Javans: the greatest part of the men being circumcised
and forced to adopt the Mahomedan religion.</p>

<p>The Dutch authorities, in endeavouring to account for this
act, incline to an opinion that the <em>Susúnan</em> was (not without
an appearance of probability) immediately impelled to it by
many acts of oppression and injustice exercised against his
subjects, by a total disregard of all his representations for
redress, by an evident intention on the part of the Dutch to
become masters of the whole island, and by the harsh and
uncivil conduct of the Resident towards the first men of the
court, which was the more obnoxious from his being the son
of a Javan woman, and for that reason, and the illegitimacy
of his birth, much despised by the natives.</p>

<p>When this intelligence reached <em>Semárang</em>, the Dutch began
to open their eyes. The first step that was taken was to pass
a decree, absolving the <em>Pangéran</em> of <em>Madúra</em> from his allegiance
to the <em>Susúnan</em>. This decree was formally signed by the
government of <em>Semárang</em>, and accepted by the <em>Pangéran</em>,
who being married to a sister of the <em>Susúnan</em>, returned his
wife back to her brother. No sooner had he declared himself
the ally of the Dutch, than he ordered all the Chinese on the
island of <em>Madúra</em> to be put to death, and embarking his
forces immediately, took possession of <em>Sidáyu</em>, <em>Tuban</em>, <em>Jípang</em>,
and <em>Lamúng'an</em>. At <em>Grésik</em> about four hundred Chinese were
put to death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1242" id="Page_1242">[Vol II Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>The Chinese, in the meantime, finding themselves reinforced
by the Javans, spread over the whole country without
encountering opposition, and laid siege at the same time to
nearly all the Company's settlements along the coast, from
<em>Tégál</em> to <em>Pasúruan</em>.</p>

<p>After many feeble and unskilful attacks on the fort of <em>Semárang</em>,
and the loss of many lives, the united forces of the
Javans and Chinese were compelled to raise the siege.</p>

<p>A negociation was now brought about by means of the
<em>Pangéran</em> of <em>Madúra</em>, who represented to the Dutch that the
attack upon the fort, as well as the subsequent part taken by
the Javans, was solely at the instigation of the minister,
<em>Náta Kasúma</em>, and that the <em>Susúnan</em> himself was personally
averse to these measures. The <em>Susúnan</em>, according to the
Dutch accounts, regretted the precipitate steps he had taken,
either as beginning to fear that the Dutch might again, as in
former wars, obtain the ascendancy, and make him pay dear
for his temerity; or, which appeared to him most likely, apprehending
that the Chinese, who, though comparatively few
and unused to arms, had hitherto taken the lead in every affair
of consequence, and evinced their superiority to the Javans in
ability and courage, should become too powerful, and might,
in concert with some discontented chiefs, think fit to depose
him. From one or other, or both of these motives, the <em>Susúnan</em>
desired to renew his alliance with the Dutch.</p>

<p>The Dutch, on their part, considering the precarious state of
the time and circumstances, found it advisable to enter into
amicable relations, and accordingly concluded a peace, by
which were ceded to them the island of <em>Madúra</em>, the sea-coast,
and <em>Surabáya</em>, with all the districts to the eastward, as
<em>Balambáng'an</em>, and <em>Rembáng</em>, <em>Japára</em>, and <em>Semárang</em>, with
all their subordinate posts.</p>

<p>According to the Javan accounts, this treaty was concluded
without the knowledge of the minister, <em>Náta Kasúma</em>, who
with the Javan and Chinese forces still lay encamped not far
from <em>Semárang</em>: and it was agreed upon by the <em>Susúnan</em>, at
the request of the Dutch, that the Chinese should be kept in
ignorance of what was passing, in order that they might be
the more easily massacred by their supposed friends the
Javans. <em>Náta Kasúma</em>, however, no sooner heard of the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1243" id="Page_1243">[Vol II Pg 243]</a></span>ditions
on which the peace had been concluded, and of the intention
to massacre the Chinese, than he took part with them,
and revealed the whole plot. To preserve appearances, however,
he made a sham attack on the Chinese, in which the sick
alone were sacrificed. The rest moved off unmolested to the
eastward, meditating vengeance against the <em>Susúnan</em>, by whom
they had been thus deserted. Their principal force was now
assembled in the districts of <em>Páti</em> and <em>Jawána</em>, where they
were joined by many of the chiefs who had hitherto been attached
to their cause. Here they proclaimed as <em>Susúnan
Ráden Mas Garéndi</em>, son of <em>Pangéran Tépa Sána</em>, who had
recently been put to death by the <em>Susúnan</em>, and grandson of
<em>Susúnan Mangkurat Mas</em>, who had died at Ceylon. He assumed
the title of <em>Susúnan Mangkúrat Mas Prábu Kúning</em>,
but is usually distinguished by the name of <em>Susúnan Kúning</em>.
This prince was about ten years of age, and therefore the transactions
which ensued are to be attributed to his ministers,
<em>Mangunónang</em> and <em>Mérta Púra</em>, and to the Chinese chiefs,
<em>Síngsih</em> and <em>Pánjang</em>.</p>

<p><em>Náta Kasúma</em>, the minister, still feigning allegiance, returned
to <em>Kérta Súra</em>; but the part he had taken being discovered,
he was sent to <em>Semárang</em> on a false mission, as was
customary in such cases, and there entrapped by the Dutch
and conveyed to Ceylon.</p>

<p>The Chinese, with their emperor, now marched with great
expedition to <em>Kérta Súra</em>, in order to attack the <em>Susúnan</em>, and
met with but little resistance. The troops of the <em>Susúnan</em>,
under the command of <em>Ráden Prínga Láya</em>, were defeated,
<em>Kérta Súra</em> was surprised, and the <em>Susúnan</em> was obliged to
leave his court, and treasures to the enemy. His queen, sister,
and children, on horseback, together with his mother, carried
by two Europeans, under the conduct of two Dutch officers,
through a back gate of the <em>dálam</em>, were pursued and overtaken.
The <em>Susúnan</em> and the hereditary prince only were
enabled to save themselves by flight.</p>

<p>It was not likely that an alliance between the Chinese and
Javans, people so different and hostile to each other, could be
of any long duration. While the Chinese became relaxed in
their discipline, and indulged in every species of irregularity,
the fugitive emperor, being now joined by the Dutch and <em>Ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1244" id="Page_1244">[Vol II Pg 244]</a></span>durese</em>,
received the submission of many of the rebel chiefs,
and pardoned them; but he refused to pay attention to the
offers of submission made by the Chinese. The prince of
<em>Madúra</em>, at length, succeeded in making himself master of
<em>Kérta Súra</em>, from whence the <em>Susúnan Kuning</em> was obliged
to fly, after a reign of four months.</p>

<p>The Chinese being afterwards defeated in a pitched battle
at <em>Asém</em>, retreated to <em>Brambánan</em>, and the <em>Susúnan</em> again
arrived in his capital. When, however, the prince of <em>Madúra</em>,
who was by no means well inclined to the <em>Susúnan</em>, found
himself in possession of <em>Kérta Súra</em>, he made an attempt to
raise to the throne <em>Pangéran Angebai</em>, the <em>Susúnan's</em> brother.
The <em>Susúnan</em> was once more obliged to quit his capital, and
it was not until after much negociation between the Dutch
and the Javans, that he was re-established. Whether this
attempt on the part of the Madurese prince was serious, or
only intended to render the sovereign more complying to the
demands of his allies, is not known. The negociation, however,
as was usual in similar cases, turned out highly advantageous
to the Dutch interests, a treaty being dictated by
them without the walls of the palace, and before the prince
was permitted to enter it.</p>

<p>The Chinese, who had meanwhile remained at <em>Brambánan</em>
unmolested for two whole months, were now joined by <em>Páku
Nagára</em>, a man noted among the Javans for his eminent
abilities, and distinguished afterwards for the conspicuous
part he acted in what is called "the war of Java," and
through his means the party were enabled still to make a
stand: they were at length, however, defeated by the Dutch
troops, and compelled to retreat over the southern hills. A
general amnesty being proclaimed, and the Chinese having
availed themselves of it, the ex-emperor at length surrendered
to the Dutch at <em>Surabáya</em>, by whom he was banished to
Ceylon, where he died. This event happened in the Javan
year 1667, and terminated the Chinese war.</p>

<p>After a few months the <em>Susúnan</em>, in conformity with
ancient custom, removed the seat of government from <em>Kérta
Súra</em> to the village of <em>Solo</em>, about six miles distant, where a
palace was built. The new capital was called <em>Súra Kérta</em>,
and is the present residence of the emperors of Java.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1245" id="Page_1245">[Vol II Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>On the subsequent accession of Mr. Imhoff to the post of
governor-general, he was of opinion that, notwithstanding the
favourable terms of the treaties granted by the <em>Susúnan</em>, sufficient
atonement had not been made to the Dutch nation for
the outrage committed against the Christian religion, and the
barbarous treatment of the garrison of <em>Kérta Súra</em>. He
therefore required that the two principal ringleaders should be
delivered up and punished; and to ensure compliance, measures
were taken for seizing upon the <em>Susúnan</em> and his son,
and bestowing the throne on the eldest son of <em>Pangéran
Mángku Nagára</em>. But the <em>Susúnan</em> thought it prudent to
comply, and delivered over two priests to the Dutch; and a
new treaty was on this occasion concluded with the <em>Susúnan</em>.</p>

<p>Fresh disturbances soon succeeded. The <em>Pangéran</em> of
<em>Madúra</em>, <em>Chákra Deníngrat</em>, a man of a selfish and haughty
character, considered himself, in consequence of the part
he had taken, so far exalted above the other chiefs, that he
neglected to make his annual appearance at court. Of this
the <em>Susúnan</em> complained to the Dutch, who interfered, but
without effect. The <em>Pangéran</em>, who, as before stated, had
taken possession of the provinces of <em>Sidáya</em>, <em>Túban</em>, <em>Jípang</em>,
and <em>Lamúng'an</em>, now refused to restore them either to the
<em>Susúnan</em> or the Dutch, to whom they had been ceded,
claiming them, as well as all the plunder he had obtained at
<em>Kérta Súra</em>, as conquered property. Determined to keep
them by force, he engaged in his service a number of men
from <em>Báli</em>, and fortified the island <em>Menári</em>, so as to command
the harbour of <em>Surabáya</em>.</p>

<p>He now commenced open hostilities by attacking a Dutch
vessel, and putting to death several European seamen. Two
thousand Madúrese entered the district of <em>Surabáya</em>, burnt
some villages, and laid the country waste; and five thousand
<em>Bálians</em> were posted on the frontiers of <em>Pamakásan</em>.
After having been twice or thrice defeated, the <em>Pangéran</em>
made a sudden attack upon <em>Súmenap</em> and <em>Pamakásan</em>, and
gained a complete victory over the natives fighting under a
Dutch commander, who lost six thousand men on the occasion,
the chief being obliged to fly the country.</p>

<p>It was not long before the Dutch regained possession of
<em>Súmenap</em> and <em>Pamakásan</em>, on which occasion a brother-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1246" id="Page_1246">[Vol II Pg 246]</a></span>in-law
of the <em>Pangéran</em>, with two chiefs, submitted to them;
but the Dutch troops were no sooner withdrawn, than those
provinces again fell under the authority of the <em>Pangéran</em>, who
laid them waste with fire and sword. The Dutch tried in
vain to dislodge him. <em>Rémbang</em> was now besieged by an
army of fire thousand Madúrese and Javans. <em>Lásém</em>,
<em>Pájang-kungung</em>, and all the villages as far as <em>Paradésa</em>,
were in possession of the <em>Pangéran</em>, who made himself
master also of the fort of <em>Rémbang</em>, and of the building yard
established there; but his fortune suddenly changed. The
prince was, in his turn, defeated in several engagements, and
at length compelled to fly from Java; and the Dutch forces
landing on <em>Madúra</em>, took the capital <em>Sámpang</em>, by storm,
and in a short time made themselves masters of the whole
island.</p>

<p>In this extremity, the prince of <em>Madúra</em> still refused to
come to terms, and went with his sons, <em>Sásra</em> and <em>Rána
Deníngrat</em>, to <em>Banjermásin</em> on Borneo, where he engaged his
passage on board an English ship bound to Bencoolen; to
which place he had previously, on his affairs taking an unfavourable
turn, sent his son, <em>Ráden Tumúng'gung Wíra
Deníngrat</em>, to request assistance from the English, and procure
men and warlike stores. His plan, however, of proceeding
to Bencoolen was frustrated; for the sultan of <em>Banjermásin</em>,
on application from the Dutch, sent him, with his
son <em>Sásra</em>, to Batavia, whence the father was banished to the
Cape of Good Hope, and the son to Ceylon.</p>

<p>In effecting a settlement of the country, the Dutch were
compelled to appoint another son of this prince, <em>Súra Diníngrat</em>,
to succeed as chief of <em>Madúra</em>, under the name of
<em>Sécha Deníngrat</em>. In the year 1758, this chief was also
appointed <em>Widána</em>, or chief, of several of the eastern districts.</p>

<p>But, however these successes on the part of the Dutch
might tend to the immediate tranquillity of the country, the
authority of the <em>Susúnan</em> had been seriously shaken. The
prince possessed neither the esteem nor attachment of his
subjects. To his evil star it was attributed that the empire
had not only lost much of its ancient grandeur, but was
brought to the brink of ruin. The chiefs no longer placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1247" id="Page_1247">[Vol II Pg 247]</a></span>
any confidence in him; they despised the man who had
granted such humiliating terms to the Dutch, and who, to
obtain their temporary aid, had thus sacrificed the permanent
integrity of the empire: they, therefore, were inclined to make
an effort to regain what had been lost.</p>

<p>The principal character and prime mover in this rebellion
was the <em>Pangéran Mungkubúmi</em>, a younger brother of the
<em>Susúnan</em>. During the Chinese war he had obtained considerable
experience, and was distinguished for boldness and
enterprize of character. On the Chinese being driven from
<em>Kérta Súra</em>, he had thrown himself on the protection of the
Dutch, and was now residing with his brother at <em>Kérta Súra</em>.
Next to <em>Mangkubúmi</em>, the most prominent character in the
war of Java was <em>Páku Nagára</em>, who was also called <em>Mas
Sáyed</em> but perhaps better known as the grandfather of <em>Práng
Widóno</em>. After the defeat of the Chinese at <em>Brambánan</em>,
this prince had also returned to court; but being coldly
received, again reared the standard of revolt, and escaping
into the southern mountains assumed the title of <em>Susúnan Adi
Prakúsa</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mangunónang</em>, the minister of <em>Susúnan Kúning</em>, and
<em>Mérta Púra</em>, had established themselves in the province of
<em>Sukawáti</em>, refusing to come into any terms. They invited
<em>Mangkabúmi</em> to come over to them, and promised their assistance
in raising him to the throne. <em>Mangkubúmi</em> accepted
their invitation; but finding himself deceived by them, he,
by his own exertions and those of the son of <em>Mérta Púra</em>,
obtained possession of that province, and established himself
under the title of <em>Pangéran Adipáti</em> of <em>Sukawáti</em>. He was,
however, afterwards induced to listen to terms offered him by
the <em>Susúnan</em>, who again received him into favour, and conferred
upon him the independent government of <em>Sukawáti</em>.
But these terms were not granted by the emperor without exciting
the jealousy and apprehensions of the minister <em>Prínga
Láya</em>, who easily availed himself of an early opportunity,
when the Governor-General, Van Imhoff, was on a visit to
<em>Súra Kértá</em>, to represent the danger arising from any subject
possessing so independent and extensive authority, as that recently
granted by the <em>Susúnan</em> to <em>Mangkubúmi</em>.</p>

<p>It was accordingly determined to deprive <em>Mangkubúmi</em> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1248" id="Page_1248">[Vol II Pg 248]</a></span>
this tract of country, and the resolution was personally communicated
to him in the hall of audience. The chief feigned
obedience; but in the course of the night, secretly quitted the
capital, and assembling his party proceeded to <em>Sukawáti</em>,
where he again reared the standard of rebellion. From the
flight of this prince is dated what is usually termed the war
of Java, which took place in the Javan year 1671.</p>

<p>The Dutch now took an active part in the war, but found
that they had enemies to contend with who possessed considerable
ability and enterprize, and who in the past disturbances
of the country had gained much experience. <em>Páku
Nagára</em> was, in the first instance, defeated, and fled for protection
to <em>Mangkubúmi</em>, who received him kindly, gave him
his daughter, <em>Rátu Bandára</em>, in marriage, and appointed him
his <em>Pateh</em>, or minister. The united forces of these two chiefs
resisted the attacks of the Dutch for about twelve months,
when <em>Mangkubúmi</em> assumed the title of <em>Susúnan Matárem</em>;
but a dispute arising between him and <em>Páku Nagára</em>, who
demanded his own nomination as presumptive successor,
<em>Mangkubúmi</em> took back his daughter, and the chiefs parted in
enmity.</p>

<p>While <em>Mangkubúmi</em> lay with his forces at <em>Bunáran</em>, a village
on the south coast, and distant about ten miles from the
present <em>Yúgya Kérta</em>, intelligence was received of the death
of the <em>Susúnan</em>; and such was the extensive power of <em>Mangkubúmi</em>
at the time, that the body of the deceased could not
be removed to the consecrated burial place at <em>Megíri</em> in the
southern hills, on account of his forces, and was in consequence
interred near the tomb of <em>Jáka Tíngker</em>, sultan of
<em>Pájang</em>, at <em>Lawian</em>, near <em>Súra Kérta</em>, whence this prince received
the appellation of <em>Susúnan Séda Lawigan</em>.</p>

<p><em>Mangkubúmi</em> had evinced a desire to come to terms, and
gave assurances to the governor of his attachment to the
Dutch, but demanded that his son should be proclaimed <em>Pangéran
Adipáti Matárem</em> (heir apparent); a condition to which
the Dutch would not listen.</p>

<p>The reduced state of the <em>Susúnan's</em> authority before his
death, and the distracted condition of affairs, afforded an
opportunity too favourable to be overlooked by the Dutch, of
at once attaining the grand object of all their political inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1249" id="Page_1249">[Vol II Pg 249]</a></span>ference,
the sovereignty of the country. A weak prince on
his death-bed was, under existing circumstances, easily
brought to any terms, in the hope of continuing even the nominal
succession in his family. He was compelled, by a
formal official deed, "to abdicate for himself and his heirs,
the sovereignty of the country, conferring the same on the
Dutch East India Company, and leaving it to them to dispose
of it, in future, to any person they might think competent
to govern it for the benefit of the Company and of
Java." After recommending his children, and especially
the heir apparent, to the protection of the governor, the unfortunate
monarch expired. This singular and important
deed was dated on the 11th December, 1749.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>From this deed is derived the right by which the Dutch
East India Company subsequently granted in <em>fee</em> to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1250" id="Page_1250">[Vol II Pg 250]</a></span>
native princes, the administration of those provinces which
still continued under native government.</p>

<p>On the death of this unfortunate prince, <em>Mangkubúmi</em>
caused himself to be formally proclaimed <em>Susúnan Pakubúana
Senapáti Matárem</em>, in the presence of a more numerous
assemblage of the princes and chiefs than attended the investiture
of the new <em>Susúnan</em> raised by the Dutch. He sent
ambassadors to the Dutch governor with many assurances of
attachment and fidelity, requesting to be acknowledged as
sovereign, and soliciting that the body of the deceased might
be delivered to him, for the purpose of solemn interment.</p>

<p>The son of the deceased <em>Susúnan</em>, however, was preferred,
and at the age of nine years was raised to the throne, under
the title of <em>Pakubúana</em> the third.</p>

<p>The enmity of the rebellious chiefs to each other soon
vented itself in open hostility, and a pitched battle ensued,
in which <em>Mangkubúmi</em> was defeated and driven to the westward.
Soon, however, recruiting his forces, he returned, and
had two successful engagements with the Dutch, one at
<em>Jánar</em>, a village in <em>Báglen</em>, the other at <em>Tídar</em>, a hill in <em>Kedú</em>.
In the battle of <em>Jánár</em> the Javan forces allowed the brunt of
the action to fall upon the Dutch, who were completely
routed: of those who had escaped the sword many were
drowned in an adjoining marsh, and the rest were murdered
in great numbers by the country people. The affair of <em>Tídar</em>
was of less importance. The forces of <em>Mangkubúmi</em> were
sometimes reduced to a few hundred, and at other times
amounted to as many thousands, the chiefs and people deserting
him in his distress, and flocking to him in his prosperity.
After three victories obtained over the Dutch, he
marched towards the northern coast, fell upon <em>Pakalóng'an</em>,
and plundered the place.</p>

<p><em>Mangkubúmi</em> now carried all before him, and was once at
the gates of <em>Sólo</em>, which capital the Javans represent to have
been saved from plunder by the superstitious veneration for
the gun <em>niái stómi</em>, which the rebels no sooner descried on
the <em>alun-alun</em> than they sounded a retreat. The Dutch, in
the hope of allaying his displeasure, had given the <em>Susúnan</em>
the choice of his officers of state, and prohibited the resident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1251" id="Page_1251">[Vol II Pg 251]</a></span>
from taking his seat on the throne with him (an indelicate
assumption which had previously given the greatest disgust
to the Javans); but after nine years of harassing warfare it
was still found impracticable to reduce the rebellious chiefs,
or to restore the country to order. The Dutch, therefore,
availing himself of the abdication in their favour executed by
the deceased <em>Susúnan</em>, listened to the proposals of <em>Mangkubúmi</em>,
who offered peace, on condition that one half of Java
should be ceded to him. A meeting took place at <em>Gingánti</em>,
a village not far distant from <em>Súra-kérta</em>, at which were
present the <em>Susúnan</em>, <em>Mangkubúmi</em>, and the governor of the
north-east coast of Java, when a treaty was signed.</p>

<p>One of the conditions of this treaty was, that <em>Mangkubúmi</em>
should use his utmost exertions to subdue <em>Páku Nagára</em>.
In conformity with this condition he immediately proceeded
against him; but <em>Páku Nagára</em> making his appearance with
his whole force, obliged him to retreat and conceal himself in
a cavern, while his troops, flying in every direction, allowed
his camp to be burned. <em>Mangkubúmi</em>, however, soon collected
his forces again. The Dutch offered a reward for the head of
<em>Páku Nagára</em>, who was obliged to proceed to the eastward,
being pursued and his whole force finally overthrown. He
still refused to submit, and the celebrity of his name and exploits
was sufficient to recruit his ranks.</p>

<p>In the year A.D. 1755, <em>Mangkubúmi</em> was solemnly proclaimed
by the Dutch Governor, under the title of <em>Súltan
Amangkubuána Sénapáti Ingalága Abdul Ráchman Sahédin
Panatagáma Kulifatólah</em>.</p>

<p>The united forces of the <em>Susúnan</em> and <em>Sultan</em> now resumed
the attack upon <em>Páku Nagára</em>; several of his chiefs were
forced to submit, and he himself, after having prolonged the
war for upwards of two years, seeing no <em>favourable</em> chance or
hope of ultimate success, at last sent his brother to the <em>Susúnan</em>,
requesting that certain districts and the southern mountains
might be granted to him for his support, promising on
that condition to lead a quiet and peaceable life for the future.
In reply to this he was informed, that the partition of the
lands had already taken place; that part of these lands might,
however, be granted, but that it was first necessary he should
make his appearance at court. To this he assented; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1252" id="Page_1252">[Vol II Pg 252]</a></span>
being stipulated that the <em>Susúnan</em> should pay him the compliment
of receiving him at the distance of half an hour's
walk from <em>Sura-kérta</em>, he came in, and throwing himself at
the feet of the <em>Susúnan</em> was kindly raised again, desired to
sit on the bench, and assured that he had nothing to apprehend.</p>

<p>Peace was then concluded, on the conditions that <em>Páku
Nagára</em>, commonly called <em>Mas Sáyed</em>, should assume the
rank and title of <em>Pangéran Adipáti Mangku Nágara</em>, with an
assignment of land to the extent of four thousand <em>cháchas</em>,
in the districts of <em>Kadwang</em>, <em>Malésa</em>, and the southern mountains.</p>

<p>Thus ended, in the year 1758, a war which had lasted
twelve years, in which the finest provinces of the island were
laid waste, thousands slain on both sides, and the independence
of the empire finally annihilated. The expenses incurred
by the Dutch on account of the war, from the year
1746 until the peace, amounted to 4,286,006. 12. 8. florins;
but, in the result, they acquired, if not the acknowledged sovereignty
of the whole island, at least an effectual control
over its future administration.</p>

<p>The <em>Susúnan</em>, on his death, was succeeded, in the Javan
year 1714, by his son, the present <em>Susúnan</em>, under the title of
<em>Susúnan Pakubuána</em> the fourth.</p>

<p>The sultan established his capital a few miles distant from
the ancient capital of <em>Matárem</em>, at <em>Yúgya-kérta</em> (<em>Djocjo
Carta</em>) the present residence of his successors. He died,
after a long reign, in the Javan year 1718, and was succeeded
by his eldest surviving son, under the title of <em>Amangkubuána</em>
the second. This prince was deposed by the British government
in the year 1812, and succeeded by his son, <em>Amangkubuána</em>
the third, who dying, was again succeeded, in 1815,
by his son, a child of nine years of age, the present sultan,
<em>Amangkubuána</em> the fourth.</p>

<p><em>Pangéran Prang Widóno</em>, still residing at <em>Súra Kérta</em>, is
the grandson of <em>Pangéran Adipáti Mángku Nagára</em>, and continues
to enjoy the independent administration of the lands
assigned to him at the settlement in 1758.</p>

<p>By the final settlement of the country in 1758 the Dutch
reserved to themselves the direct administration of all the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1253" id="Page_1253">[Vol II Pg 253]</a></span>vinces
lying on the northern sea-coast, from <em>Chéribon</em> to the
eastern extremity of the island of <em>Madúra</em>; but the inland
and southern provinces stretching from the islands of <em>Chéribon</em>
to <em>Málang</em>, were restored to the native princes, between whom
the lands were divided in nearly equal portions by <em>cháchas</em>,
according to the population and the peculiar usage of the
country, four thousand <em>cháchas</em> from the share of the <em>Susúnan</em>
being set apart for <em>Mangku Nagára</em>.</p>

<p>The terms on which the successors of these princes were
permitted to exercise the sovereignty, suffered no material
alteration until the year 1808, when Marshal Daendels officially
declared that the clauses of the existing treaties, by
which those princes held their territory in fee from the Dutch,
were void, and that in future he should consider them as independent
princes, having no other relation to the European
government than such as must of necessity exist between a
weaker and stronger state in the immediate neighbourhood of
each other. At this time the court of <em>Yúgya Kérta</em>, sensible
of owing its establishment chiefly to the military success of
its founder, and the weakness of the Dutch and the <em>Susúnan</em>,
and that it never fully submitted to the terms of the treaty of
1755 (which it is even stated were imposed upon the sovereign
by a false translation in the Javan language) evinced a desire
of independence and an appearance of internal strength,
which called for the immediate interference of the European
authority. Marshal Daendels, therefore, marched to <em>Yúgya
Kérta</em> with a considerable force, and a negociation being
opened, a treaty was entered into, by which the reigning sultan
consented to resign the administration of the country into
the hands of his son, who was appointed to exercise the same
under the title of regent, and to cede certain provinces.</p>

<p>But the stipulations of this treaty, thus entered into, had
not been carried into effect, when in the month of August,
1811, the British forces arrived in Java. The sultan, it is
true, had ostensibly resigned the administration to his son,
but he still took his usual place on the throne, and not one of
the districts ceded by treaty to the Dutch had then been actually
transferred.</p>

"As soon as the Dutch commander arrived at <em>Pasúruan</em> he assembled
the people, and offered a reward of one thousand dollars to any one
who would bring him the body of the deceased chief <em>Sarapáti</em>. The
body was accordingly brought in a perfect state of preservation, on
which the commandant ordered it to be placed upright in a chair, as if
still living. He then approached it, took it by the hand, and made his
obeisance to it as to a living person: all the officers and men followed
the example. After this they burnt the body, and having mixed the
ashes with gunpowder, fired a salute with it in honour of the victory."</p></div>

was entered into between the Dutch and the sultan of Bantam, of
which the following were the chief articles.
</p>
<p>
1st. The Dutch having deemed it necessary to send a detachment to <em>Lampung
Túlang Báwang</em>, in order to save that province from total ruin, the
sultan promised to cause a fort, or <em>páger</em>, to be erected at his expense, on
the spot which should be deemed most eligible for that purpose, either on
the <em>Palembang</em> river, or any where else.
</p>
<p>
2d. That the sultan should keep this fort in constant repair at his own
expense.
</p>
<p>
3d. That the sultan should repay to the Dutch the expense of maintaining
a small establishment, consisting of a resident, a commandant,
one sergeant, two corporals, twenty-four privates, one drummer, and
three artillery men.
</p>
<p>
4th. That the ground on which the fort was to be built, should be
ceded to the Dutch, with an extent of one hundred roods in every direction.
This ground to revert back to the sultan, in the event of the
Dutch establishment breaking up, in the same manner as had taken place
in regard to <em>Lampung Samángka</em>.
</p>
<p>
6th. With a view to hold out due encouragement to the industry of the
<em>Lampung</em> people, it was agreed that, previously to exporting their pepper
to <em>Bantam</em>, they should state the quantity to the Company's resident, who
should furnish them with a certificate, enabling them to obtain early payment,
pursuant to the existing contracts.
</p>
<p>
7th. The Company's servants at <em>Bantam</em> and <em>Lampung Túlang Báwang</em>,
were authorized to confiscate any quantity of pepper which was exported
from the latter place, unprovided with a certificate from the resident.

<p>The present Susúnan is consequently the eighteenth in succession
from the first Mahomedan sovereign, and not perhaps
less than the fortieth from the first Hindu prince. The
average reign during the Mahomedan government is nineteen
years. Taking the same average for the period of the Hindu
government, its origin would be four hundred and eighteen
years anterior to the destruction of <em>Majapáhit</em>, A. J. 1400,
and may be referred to the close of the tenth century of the
Javan era, or the middle of the eleventh century of the Christian
era.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1255" id="Page_1255">[Pg

<h2>ACCOUNT<br />
OF<br />
THE SEVERAL PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS<br />
OF<br />
JAVA AND MADURA.</h2>


<p>In several parts of this work, and in particular when treating
of agriculture and revenue, reference has been made to the
changes introduced by the British government in the internal
management of the country, and to the information of a
statistical nature which was collected with regard to its resources.</p>

<p>It may not be uninteresting to the reader to possess, in a
compressed form, the result of the surveys and inquiries which
were then set on foot, as far as the same were completed at
the close of the British administration on Java. The Appendix
L. contains a copy of the proclamation and of the
general instructions issued by the government; the latter will
sufficiently explain the principle on which the tables for the
eastern districts were compiled.</p>


<h3>BANTAM.</h3>

<p>Bantam, once rich in its pepper plantations and the emporium
of the Archipelago, had, in consequence of the restrictions
of the Dutch company and the vicinity of Batavia, lost
all its trade and importance, long before the arrival of the
British.</p>

<p>The succession of the throne of Bantam was generally disposed
of by the influence of the Dutch government: but the
administration of the country and the collection of the port
duties were till very lately entirely entrusted to him. This
European influence, though strongly resisted in the first instance,
had been long acquiesced in, till an attempt of the
Dutch government, in the year 1808, to draw additional benefit
from this province, gave occasion to an insurrection.
The successive measures of introducing the cultivation of coffee
into that part of the island, of opening the communication by
means of new roads, and of constructing a new harbour, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1266" id="Page_1266">[Vol II Pg 266]</a></span>
at <em>Mew</em> Bay, and afterwards at <em>Merak</em> Bay, imposed new and
unusual burthens on the people; and so many deserted from
the public works that an order was issued to the Resident,
requiring him to inform the sultan that his first minister
should be held responsible for the due execution of the public
task assigned to the sultan's subjects. The desertion still
continuing, an order still more peremptory was issued to the
Resident, requiring him to call upon the sultan to deliver up
his first minister immediately. In carrying these orders into
execution, the Resident having imprudently risked his person,
was murdered. This fatal accident was the occasion of sending
a considerable military force to Bantam, by which an
immediate and thorough change in the native government was
effected. The reigning sultan was removed from the throne
and banished to Amboina, and a relative was raised to the
sovereign power.</p>

<p>This prince was placed under regulations dictated by the
Dutch; for so fallen had the sovereigns of this once flourishing
and powerful kingdom now become, that the form and solemnity
of a treaty was not deemed necessary. The sultan
ceded part of his territories to the westward, adjacent to the
environs of Batavia, the bad administration of which had frequently
given occasion to disturbances in the Batavian districts.
The new sultan was allowed to administer the rest
of his dominions under the superior rule of the Dutch government.</p>

<p>The public works to be carried on in Bantam, and the unusual
burthens they imposed on the people, continued however
to excite, from time to time, disturbances and insurrections.
On one occasion a detachment, consisting of a lieutenant
and eighteen dragoons, were surprised and murdered
by the inhabitants. Several native <em>Pangérans</em> and chiefs fell
victims to the same spirit of discontent and revenge, and another
change in the person of the sultan was thought advisable;
the new sultan was in consequence allured on board a vessel,
and conveyed to Batavia, and in his place another chief was
installed sultan of the high lands of Bantam, the Dutch reserving
to themselves the direct administration of the low
lands.</p>

<p>The country, however, remaining still in a disturbed state,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1267" id="Page_1267">[Vol II Pg 267]</a></span>
the <em>Pangéran Akmet</em> united under his banner the discontented
people of all descriptions, in a more regular opposition
to the European authority. From this time an extraordinary
military force was constantly kept in Bantam: all attempts,
however, to arrest the person of <em>Akmet</em> failed. His influence
increased so much that proposals were made to him of a
cession of part of the country: these, however, not being
listened to, it was determined to abandon the interior to his
depredations, until the inhabitants themselves, wearied of his
arbitrary proceedings, might seek refuge with the European
government.</p>

<p>The Dutch force being withdrawn from Bantam, <em>Akmet</em>
availed himself of the presence of the British cruizers, during
the blockade in 1811, to strengthen his influence by an intercourse
with them, which he easily effected by furnishing them
with supplies plundered by him from the inhabitants. By the
cruizers he was considered as an unfortunate prince, maintaining
his independence against the Dutch; and when the
British troops landed, the sultan was his prisoner, and all
Bantam under his controul.</p>

<p>At the conquest of Java by the British forces the extensive
tracts of this fertile province were thus in the hands of a
lawless rebel, the inhabitants were in a state of revolt, and
universal anarchy and distrust had prevailed for several years.
All idea of raising a revenue on account of government had
been abandoned; and the general settlement of the country
under European controul, was the most that could be hoped
for.</p>

<p>In the year 1813 the sultan voluntarily resigned the administration
of the country into the hands of the British government,
in consideration of an annual pension of ten thousand
Spanish dollars. With the detailed system of land revenue
introduced into this province, an accurate survey was made of
all the northern divisions; and a settlement having been made
with each individual cultivator, the extent of population stated
in the annexed table, as far as these districts are concerned,
may be considered as in general correct. The population of
the southern districts is estimated; and it may be observed,
that the total population rather exceeds than falls short of
what is stated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1268" id="Page_1268">[Vol II Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<h3>BATAVIA.</h3>

<p>Of the splendour and magnificence which procured for this
capital the title of the Queen of the East, little is now to be
found. Streets have been pulled down, canals half filled up,
forts demolished, and palaces levelled with the dust. The
state-house, where the supreme court of justice and magistracy
still assemble, remains; merchants transact their business in
the town during the day, and its warehouses still contain the
richest productions of the island, but few Europeans of respectability
sleep within its limits.</p>

<p>The following table comprises all fixed residents within
the city and its immediate suburbs, to the distance of about
two miles. The municipal regulations of this part of the
island having been continued in force, and the execution of
them, for the most part, delegated to Dutch authorities, it is
to be apprehended that the return of the population now
given may be found deficient in accuracy. A poll-tax being
levied on the Chinese, and other town duties rendering it the
interest of the parties to withhold information as to the exact
numbers, it is also probable that the total amount considerably
exceeds that now given: certainly it does not fall short of it.</p>

<h3>ENVIRONS OF BATAVIA.</h3>

<p>The lands comprehended under the denomination of the
Batavian environs (<em>Ommelanden</em>), originally formed the principal
part of the <em>Jakátra</em> dominions. The native chiefs were
early deprived of the administration by the cautious policy of
the Dutch, and the lands subsequently sold in property to
Europeans and others. According to an official valuation in
1813, the amount of property in houses and lands, belonging
to individuals, in the city of Batavia and its environs, including
the private estates near <em>Buitenzorg</em>, exceeded eleven
millions of rix-dollars silver, and the taxes were levied on
that estimate. Various systems of government had been
attempted in this district before the arrival of the British in
1811, but so inefficacious were they, that it was considered
unsafe for Europeans to travel without arms. As a measure
of police, a portion of this division, formerly comprized within
the <em>Ommelanden</em>, was recently annexed to the regency of
<em>Buitenzorg</em>, and formed into a separate administration. For
the population of these two divisions, as they now stand, see
General Table, Vol. I, page <a href="#Page_62">62</a>, Table II.</p>


<h3>BATAVIAN OR PRIANGEN REGENCIES.</h3>

<p>Each of these regencies was administered by a native chief,
immediately dependent on government, and without any
power beyond his district. The chiefs, however, were mostly
allied by frequent intermarriages, and traced their descent
from different chieftains of the ancient empire of <em>Pajajáran</em>.
Separated, on the one hand, from the dominions of the
<em>Susúnan</em> and sultan by the country of Chéribon, and on the
other from Bantam by the Batavian environs, their power
never became formidable to the European government. The
coffee monopoly in the Western Districts having been maintained
on its former principle during the period of the British
administration, the inhabitants of these districts were precluded
from feeling the effects of the system introduced into
the more eastern districts; but as it was in contemplation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1272" id="Page_1272">[Vol II Pg 272]</a></span>
eventually, to render the change general throughout the island,
preparatory measures were taken, and a survey of these districts
being made, the annexed statistical table was framed.
The produce stated in the table is estimated according to the
native returns; these districts likewise furnish an annual
quantity of about seventy-five thousand hundred-weight of
coffee for the European market.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1273" id="Page_1273">[Vol II Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHERIBON.</h3>

<p>Chéribon fell under the European influence in the year
1666, and has now been subject to it one hundred and fifty
years. It was among the first cessions made to the Dutch by
the princes of <em>Matárem</em>.</p>

<p>This province had, like Bantam, been in a state of continued
insurrection for many years preceding the arrival of
the English. The importance of the town of <em>Chéribon</em> has
considerably declined, partly in consequence of these commotions,
and partly of epidemic fevers which prevailed some
years ago.</p>

<p>The extensive and fertile province of <em>Chéribon</em> did not,
under the administration of the Dutch Company, yield those
profits which were expected from its great natural resources;
especially of indigo, coffee, and teak timber. The Sultans of
<em>Chéribon</em>, descended from one of the founders of the Mahomedan
religion on Java, and on that account objects of religious
veneration among the more orthodox Mahomedans, were always
left in the entire management of the native administration.
The coffee and other produce exacted from the people,
was delivered by the Sultan, and paid for to him. Under this
system, the residents of <em>Chéribon</em> enjoyed an annual income
of from eighty to one hundred thousand dollars (£23,000),
while the Sultans were every year more and more impoverished.
At length an insurrection broke out in 1800, the ostensible reason
of which was the unjust removal of Sultan <em>Kanóman</em>, who
had been banished by the Dutch to Amboina, and the real
cause probably the great oppression of the common inhabitants,
occasioned by the distress of the Sultans, and the indiscriminate
admission of too many Chinese in the interior of
the country. The reinstallation of Sultan <em>Kanóman</em>, in 1808,
by Marshal Daendals, did not appease the minds of the people;
and the unwillingness or inability of that prince to restore
the public tranquillity, led to an entirely new organization of
the country.</p>

<p>When the island was conquered by the British troops, the
rebel, <em>Bágus Rángen</em>, still maintained himself in the eastern
parts of <em>Kráwang</em>, in perfect defiance of the power of govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1275" id="Page_1275">[Vol II Pg 275]</a></span>ment,
sternly rejecting the offers of pardon and oblivion which
were on that occasion offered to him, and eluding or defeating
all attempts to destroy or ensnare him. Such was the veneration
in which this man was regarded by the people of these
districts, and such the dread in which he was held by the
native chiefs (through whose means alone his apprehension
was to be accomplished), that he remained in perfect quiet
and security, maintained a correspondence with the disaffected
throughout the province, secured his regular supplies of ammunition
and provisions from all parts, and even from the
town of <em>Chéribon</em>, and tranquilly prepared for the ensuing
rainy season, to appear again in arms and ravage the country.</p>

<p>In a few months after the establishment of a British resident
in the district, the person of <em>Bágus Rángen</em> was secured,
and the country reduced to a perfect state of tranquillity, in
which it remained during the whole period of the British administration.</p>

<p>The following extracts from the report of the gentleman<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
intrusted with the introduction of the land revenue system
into Chéribon, may serve to illustrate the state of this province:​&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is, perhaps, with the exception of the environs of
Batavia and Bantam, no part of the island of Java which
has so severely felt the bad effects of mismanagement as the
district of <em>Chéribon</em>. These effects are visible in the character
of the people, who, even among the Javans, are remarkable
for a careless indifference to the pursuit of gain,
for indolence, for want of energy, and for a credulity and
ignorance, rendering them perpetually a prey to delusion.
Within the last forty years, in particular, a series of mismanagement
and oppression is said to have wrought a most
unfavourable change in the character of the people, to have
destroyed the habits of industry, and consequently to have
changed even the aspect of the country, so that it is no
longer to be recognized as the fruitful district which it is
once represented to have been. Within the last seven years,
famine, mortality, and civil commotion, have contributed to
aggravate the evils of mismanagement, and in one or other
form have desolated some of the finest parts of the district.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1276" id="Page_1276">[Vol II Pg 276]</a></span></p>
<p>"The history of the civil commotions alluded to afford a
striking illustration of the character of the inhabitants. It
certainly gives no countenance to the representation of those
observers who ascribe to the Javans in general a character
of the most invincible apathy, stupidity, and indolence, as
if these qualities had been irrevocably engrafted upon their
very natures. A better knowledge of their real character
enables us to draw very different inferences, and to ascribe
to them a much larger share of sensibility, than could from
reasoning be expected to result from the apparently overwhelming
causes which contribute to degrade their faculties
and blunt their energies and exertions.</p>

<p>"It is an instructive fact, highly worthy of remark, that
the successive commotions and insurrections which have
for many years disturbed the peace of <em>Chéribon</em>, have uniformly
had their origin in the Javan districts, where the
rights of private property in the soil were almost entirely
overlooked, that they have only occasionally extended from
the Javan to the <em>Súnda</em> districts, and have never reached
the <em>Priang'en</em> lands, where property in the soil is fully acknowledged
and respected.</p>

<p>"The taxes which fell upon agriculture were so various,
and at the same time assumed such a variety of shapes, that
it is impracticable to state in a word the actual portion
which by law or custom fell to the share of the sovereign.</p>

<p>"The most material, however, are comprehended in the
following catalogue, to which are added, others falling
equally upon agricultural industry, though not constituting
a direct source of revenue to government:</p>

<p>"1. The contingent, called in the language of the country,
<em>gántang</em>. This is usually estimated at fifteen parts in one
hundred of the rice crop; but it was, in truth, arbitrarily
assessed, according to a rough conjecture of the capability
of the country. In such of the <em>Priang'en</em> lands as continued
to be directly administered by their own native
chiefs, the amount paid to the latter was determined with
some accuracy to be one tenth of the gross produce, embracing,
as in the first case, the rice crop only.</p>

<p>"2. A poll tax, or rather a tax on families, called by the
natives of this part of the country, <em>pagalántang</em>. Part was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1277" id="Page_1277">[Vol II Pg 277]</a></span>
levied on account of government, and part on account of
the chiefs.</p>

<p>"3. Market duties or tolls. These were literally levied on
every article vended in the markets, embracing as well the
whole produce of their agriculture, as that of their petty arts
and manufactures.</p>

<p>"4. A tax on the slaughter of buffaloes, necessarily affecting
the price of food, and discouraging the rearing of an
animal indispensable to a successful prosecution of the labours
of agriculture.</p>

<p>"5. The charge of lodging and feeding travellers, and
transporting troops, baggage, and stores of all descriptions.
This is termed in the native language, <em>súguh</em>, or the rites
of hospitality.</p>

<p>"6. The obligation to construct and repair bridges, roads,
and public buildings, throughout the country.</p>

<p>"7. The obligation to cultivate and deliver, at inadequate
rates, certain foreign productions, which the actual condition
of the country, the habits of the people, and still less
their interests, could never have prompted them to undertake,
if permitted freely to pursue their own interest. Coffee
was the chief of these products.</p>

<p>"8. In speaking of the taxes which fall upon the husbandman
and the land, the <em>Zakat</em> must not be forgotten. This is
nominally a tithe, or tenth. The payment is indeed optional,
but from religious motives seldom withheld. Every
tenth sheaf of the rice crop is allotted to religious purposes,
but every man measures its size according to his own piety.
Its amount was of course very variable, but almost always
materially smaller, and generally indeed not half the size,
of the ordinary sheaf. This practice gives rise to a well
known distinction between the ordinary sheaf and that allotted
for the clergy, when the grain is brought to market."</p>

<p>The table annexed was framed on the introduction of the
detailed system; but it not being practicable, on account of
the extent of the province, for the European officer to visit
every part of the district, many of the particulars are stated
upon estimate; particularly the quantity of cultivated land
and amount of produce, which, it is to be apprehended, are
rather over-rated. The return, however, of the population
may be considered more accurate.

<h3>EASTERN DISTRICTS.</h3>

<p>The Dutch, in acquiring these extensive and valuable
provinces on the sea coast, were considered to have acquired
the same right as had previously been enjoyed by the native
sovereigns, and deemed it advisable to continue the long-established
principles and forms of native government. In the same
manner, therefore, as the emperors of Java were looked upon
as the ultimate proprietors of the land in their dominions, the
Dutch Company were considered as possessing the same
right with respect to the provinces under their immediate
administration; and the princes of Java having been in the
habit of entrusting the government, police, and revenue of
the different provinces to inferior chiefs, the same system was
adhered to under the Dutch. The native system of drawing
again the revenues of government from these inferior chieftains,
by means of contributions in kind, in money, and by
occasional fees and presents, was also maintained; a portion
of the common class of inhabitants under the native government
being assigned to the performance of different sorts of
public works, transports for government, the repair of the
roads, the construction of public buildings, the guarding of
public stores, the loading and unloading of government
vessels, the cutting of grass, the cutting of fire-wood, the
keeping a police guard, and other offices, the same principle
was adopted under the management of the Dutch, and as
under the native form of administration a reward for these
feudal services was granted, by the use of an assignment of
rice fields allotted either to individuals or to certain classes of
workmen, but withdrawn from them as soon as the public
duty ceased to be performed, the same mode of remuneration
was also adopted by the Dutch.</p>

<p>These principles of administration being combined with
the mercantile interests of the Dutch Company, gave rise to
certain contracts, which the native chiefs of the different
districts (termed by the Dutch <em>Regents</em>) were compelled to
enter into on their appointment, for the annual delivery to the
Company, either without payment, which was called <em>a contingent</em>,
or for a price far below that of the market, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1281" id="Page_1281">[Vol II Pg 281]</a></span>
was termed a <em>forced delivery at a fixed price</em>, of such quantity
of rice, pepper, cotton, indigo, and other articles, as the
market and present state of trade and commerce made most
desirable; while the planting of coffee and the cutting of
teak timber was always considered as a feudal service, for
which, besides the use of a certain portion of rice fields,
allotted to the individuals or villagers employed, a certain
payment was made, about equivalent to the expenses of
transportation to the government yards or storehouses.</p>

<p>The administration of the Eastern Districts, including
<em>Madúra</em>, was vested in a <em>governor and council for the north-east
coast of Java</em>. The governor was, at the same time,
director of the Company's trade, and resided at <em>Semárang</em>.
Subordinate to this government was that called <em>Gezaghebber</em>
and council, established at <em>Surabáya</em>, the chief place of the
east point of Java; while in the other principal districts along
the coast, as at <em>Tegal Pekalóngan</em>, <em>Japára</em>, <em>Jawána</em>, &amp;c.
residents were fixed: no direct correspondence from the
eastern part of the island was maintained with the government
of Batavia, except by the governor, usually termed the
governor of Java, or by the governor and council. Even the
residents at the native courts of <em>Súra Kérta</em> and <em>Yúgya
Kérta</em>, only communicated with government through him.
By him the succession to the throne of the <em>Susúnan</em> and of
the sultan was generally determined; the appointments of
native chiefs and regents were made on his proposal; the
Company's farms and duties for the Eastern Districts were
sold by him; and though he had literally no salary whatever
from the treasury of government, he was supposed to draw
from his situation a yearly revenue of between three and four
hundred thousand dollars. At the same time the correspondence
with the Eastern Districts was neither very regular nor
very expeditious, and the management of the Company's
affairs in those districts was as much a mystery to the chief
government at Batavia, as the governor of <em>Semárang</em> chose
to make it.</p>

<p>This system continued, without any essential alteration,
until after the arrival of Marshal Daendals in 1808.</p>

<p>Some of the contingents, such as indigo, cotton yarn,
pepper, &amp;c. to which, however, the regents had not without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1282" id="Page_1282">[Vol II Pg 282]</a></span>
great reluctance submitted for many years, were then indeed
partially abolished; but, on the other hand, all the peculations
of the Dutch servants residing along the coast, who had for
their own private emolument raised the deliveries, chiefly of
rice, at some places to double, and at others to more than
double the quantity legally assessed on the regents, at the
same time paying for them at some places two-thirds, and at
others only half the price assigned by the government, were
at once transferred and confirmed to government, by a single
decree, ordering, without previous inquiry or reserve, that all
the produce which had been usually delivered to the respective
residents along the coast, under whatever denomination,
should, in the same quantities and with their surplus
weight, be for the future delivered to government, and that no
higher prices should be granted for the same than that which
the residents used to pay.</p>

<p>Equally inconsistent and oppressive in its consequences
was a measure by which, on the one hand, the wages of
private labour and services were raised to an unusual price,
while on the other, the public works, the public transports,
and the plantations of coffee, were carried on either gratuitously
or at the former inadequate rate. This regulation
raised the price of all the first necessaries of life, and principally
of rice, which the common classes of the inhabitants
felt as a heavier grievance than any they had ever experienced
from the former system. Till then, the colonial
administration had always, as far as was consistent with their
own monopoly and forced delivery of produce at fixed rates,
taken particular care to keep down the price of rice and salt
as much as possible.</p>

<p>But a measure, still more pernicious in its consequences,
was that by which the native regents were each of them subjected
to a contribution in hard cash, while at the same time
the power of levying taxes on the inhabitants of these districts
was left in their hands; a system which, in all cases,
afforded them a pretext, and in many an apology, for the
most vexatious oppression.</p>

<p>The commendation which is due to this administration is
rather founded on those arrangements which had a tendency
to prevent peculations in the inferior European servants in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1283" id="Page_1283">[Vol II Pg 283]</a></span>
every department, and on the abolition of the subordinate
governments of <em>Semárang</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>. Fixed salaries
were allowed to the residents; they were prohibited from
keeping private vessels, and from all trade in the products of
their districts. The sale of the government farms and duties
was made public, and in a great measure free from corruption,
by which means they were immediately raised to more than
three times the former amount: each branch of public expenditure
and receipt was fixed and ascertained; new and
practicable roads were established; the appointment of every
native, from the first rank as low as a <em>Demáng</em>, was reserved
to the government alone; the Javan custom of pawning the
person for a small sum of money was prohibited; fees and
presents were abolished. By such measures, a much more
regular, active, pure, and efficient administration was established
on Java than ever existed at any former period of the
Dutch Company.

inaccurate, as sufficient time had not been given to complete

under the head of "Jungle Land" is capable of being converted into <em>sawah</em> and <em>tegal</em> lands, and the reason for such land not being found in a state of
cultivation, the soil being in general very rich, is the want of population.

<h3>MADURA.</h3>

<p>This island having been ceded to the Dutch, in the same
manner as the other possessions on Java, the Sultan of <em>Madúra</em>
and the chiefs of <em>Pamakásan</em> and <em>Súmenap</em> were always
considered by them in nearly the same light as the other
regents along the coast, with the exception only of a higher
title and some more personal consideration granted especially
to the Sultan of <em>Bankálan</em>, usually styled the Sultan of <em>Madúra</em>,
both on account of his birth and of some important
services rendered in the war of Java, from 1740 to 1748.

<h3>NATIVE PROVINCES.</h3>

<p>This extensive portion of the island was divided, agreeably
to the settlement of 1754, between the <em>Susuhúnan</em> and Sultan.
It consists of a number of separate provinces or districts.
Those still belonging to the <em>Susúnan</em> are:</p>

<p>In an Eastern Direction from the Capital:</p>


<ul><li>1. <em>Sríngat</em> and <em>Blítar</em> (forming one province).</li>
<li>2. <em>Kedíri.</em></li>
<li>3. <em>Pranarága.</em></li>
<li>4. <em>Paché.</em></li>
<li>5. <em>Charúban.</em></li>
<li>6. <em>Kadúwang</em>, (in part).</li>
<li>7. <em>Jagarága.</em></li>
<li>8. <em>Sukawáti</em>, (in part).</li>
</ul>

<p>And the smaller Districts of</p>


<ul><li>1. <em>Anju.</em></li>
<li>2. <em>Lorog.</em></li>
<li>3. <em>Pangol.</em></li>
<li>4. <em>Sumbreng.</em></li>
<li>5. <em>Rongkok.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In the Western Direction from the Capital:</p>


<ul><li>1. <em>Banyumas.</em></li>
<li>2. <em>Dayu Lúhur.</em></li>
<li>3. <em>Aya.</em></li>
<li>4. <em>Matárem</em>, (in part).</li>
<li>5. <em>Pamarden.</em></li>
<li>6. <em>Pasir.</em></li>
<li>7. <em>Bag'len</em>, (in part).</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides several smaller districts.</p>

<p>The ground on which the fort of <em>Súra Kérta</em> is built, with
a small part of the adjoining territory, has been ceded to the
European government, as has been also that portion of the
immediate site of the forts of <em>Boyaláti</em> and <em>Klaten</em>, which
was formerly the property of the <em>Susúnan</em>. These dominions
are divided among,</p>

<p>1. The eight active <em>Tumúng'gungs</em>, or Regents, (the first of
which is the <em>Raden Adipáti</em>, or prime minister), who constantly
resides at court.</p>

<p>2. The <em>Tumung'gungs</em> residing in the distant or <em>Mancha
Nagára</em> districts.</p>

<p>3. The princes of the blood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1329" id="Page_1329">[Vol II Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The particular favourites of the <em>Susúnan</em>.</p>

<p>5. (Which only respects the smaller territories) a number of
<em>Demangs</em> and <em>Mantris</em>.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the provinces of <em>Matárem</em> and
the adjoining districts, towards the southern part of the island,
called by the Javans <em>Ardi Kidul</em>, or southern hills, of the
province of <em>Kadúwang</em> and of the district of <em>Sukawáti</em> containing
altogether four thousand <em>cháchas</em>, having been ceded
by the predecessors of the present <em>Susúnan</em>, under the settlement
of 1752, to the prince <em>Mangku Nagára</em>, are still held
and exclusively enjoyed by his successors, the <em>Pangérang Aria
Prábo Prang Wedóna</em>.</p>

<p>The eight active <em>Tumung'gungs</em>, who reside constantly at
court, and belong to the state and household of the <em>Susúnan</em>,
are <em>Tumung'gungs</em> of the exterior (<em>Tumung'gung Jawi</em>), and
<em>Tumung'gungs</em> of the interior (<em>Tumung'gung lebat</em>). The
four former are mostly charged with external commissions or
orders, or those that do not immediately concern the household
of the prince; the four latter, or internal <em>Tumung'gungs</em>,
are mostly occupied near the person of the <em>Susúnan</em>, and
have alternately the care of the watch of the <em>Kráton</em> at night.</p>

<p>The following tables exhibit the result of a census taken
during the British government in Java; but as the information
they convey rests principally upon native authority, the
same reliance cannot be placed upon them as upon the tables
for the provinces under the immediate direction of the European
government. There is no reason, however, to believe
they are essentially wrong, as they were framed with great
care and every attention to accuracy, on the part of the native
officers employed.

<h2>APPENDIX, A.</h2>


<p>The annexed documents, as far as they can be relied on, afford evidence
of an extent of mortality in Batavia, as compared with the number of
inhabitants, that was perhaps never exampled, for the same space of time,
in any other quarter of the world.</p>

<p>The Table No. I., incomplete as it is, was drawn out with as much exactness
as the original lists and registers still in possession would admit of.
In explanation of some inconsistencies which are exhibited in it, it is
necessary to observe, that on the occasion of the capture of this island,
part of the most valuable papers were lost or destroyed, and amongst
them the register in which was stated the Chinese population, and the
number of their deaths and marriages annually, which is the reason why
no mention is made of them in this table.</p>

<p>The first and third columns contain only the numbers of <em>European</em>
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The last column, which shews the deaths of the <em>Natives</em> and <em>Slaves</em>, is
probably a list of the deceased slaves only; because there was a separate
list kept of the natives who died annually in the Batavian jurisdiction,
which, however, was for a long time incorrect, and at last destroyed in
1811.</p>

<p>It is also probable, that the column of <em>deaths</em> generally does not extend
farther than in the town and immediate suburbs; and the other two
columns of <em>baptisms</em> and <em>marriages</em> extend over the town, suburbs, and
environs together.</p>

<p>The specific lists kept in the different hospitals were likewise lost. This
is to be particularly lamented, because they would have shewn how many
of the European deaths were inhabitants, military persons, strangers, or
sailors or marines from the ships of the different nations in Batavia
Roads, who all sent their sick men into the hospitals of Batavia, who,
when dead, were comprehended in the number of European deaths. This
circumstance explains the incorrectness which appears to exist in the two
statements of the living and deceased Europeans.</p>

<p>The Table No. II. was discovered among the records of the Dutch
government at Batavia, and in the absence of a more official document,
may, perhaps, on that account, be entitled to some confidence.

<p>The unhealthiness of the climate of Batavia is connected, in the minds
of many, with the fabulous properties of the poison tree of Java, and
many are so ignorant of the island as to consider the climate of Batavia
as a fair example of that of Java in general. History attests that this city
has been highly pernicious to the health both of Europeans and Natives,
almost from its foundation, and recent experience concurs with the testimony
of history. The mines of America, when they were first discovered,
did not more strongly allure the Spaniards, nor urged them to sacrifice
more relentlessly the lives of the unresisting natives to their burning
thirst of gold, than the monopoly of Java and the Spice Islands led the
Dutch Company, in the track of wealth, through danger, injustice and
oppression. Though the unhealthiness of Batavia was at all times known
and formidable, there were times when the mortality became extraor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmix" id="Page_mmix">[Vol II Pg ix]</a></span>dinary
and alarming. Although not prone to any speculation, except that
of merchants, or to any inquiry, except for a new market or a more lucrative
channel of trade, the Company's Government in India was sometimes
forced to institute inquiries into the cause of this insalubrity, and
to speculate about the possibility and the means of removing it. Passing
by other occasions, there exists on the records of the High Regency a
reply to queries about the unhealthiness of Batavia, dated the 14th of
October 1753. This paper states that between 1732 and 1738, the
greatest number of casualties happened. It assigns, as a great cause of
the insalubrity complained of, the situation of the town in a bay, confined
on the west and east by projecting points of land, and inclosed in front
by a cluster of small islands. The space between the town and the sea
is chiefly mud, left by the retreating of the sea: a swamp surrounds the
town. The mouths of the rivers are generally covered with underwood
and a species of tree peculiar to swamps. The vegetation of these low
grounds, it is added, cannot but retain impurities of the most noxious
kind. The space which is formed at the mouths of the rivers <em>Táng'ran</em> and
<em>Ang'ki</em> is an entire swamp, covered with shrubs which emit exhalations of
an impure nature: these are interspersed with the burying grounds of
the natives, and the effluvia of these places is felt at some distance. It
was believed that the earthquake of 1699, by forcing mud from under the
earth and blocking up the mouths of the rivers more than formerly, contributed
to increase the previously existing unhealthiness. The lime kilns
in the neighbourhood, the close plantations of trees that prevent a free
circulation of air, the stagnation of the rivers from the bars of mud or
sand which obstruct their out-course into the sea, the kind of water which
the inhabitants are compelled to drink, the narrowness of their houses,
and the dirt and filth accumulated in the numerous canals that intersect
the town, have all their due share of pernicious efficiency assigned them
in this report. The buildings, it is said, are admirably adapted to keep
out the fresh air, and to retain that which is putrid or noxious. To
remedy the evils felt, a new construction of houses is recommended, and
a frequent pruning or entire extirpation of the trees.</p>

<p>The fever, which excited this inquiry, commenced in 1733 and lasted
till 1738, and, during its continuance, two thousand of the Company's
servants and free Christians annually died. In 1739 its violence abated;
but it broke out again in 1744, and continued with little diminution or
variation to the date of the report in 1753.</p>

<p>Without stopping to inquire whether it would be easier to remove disease
from Batavia, or the inhabitants of Batavia from disease, I shall take
the liberty of quoting an extract from a report on the climate of some
parts of Java, drawn up by Mr. Robertson, the late Superintending Surgeon,
which appears to me to afford a satisfactory account of the causes
of the insalubrity of the capital. After giving a statement of the mortality
that prevailed in an Indiaman, a part of the crew of which landed
at Batavia, he thus proceeds.</p>

<p>"Such is the melancholy instance of the noxious climate of Batavia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmx" id="Page_mmx">[Vol II Pg x]</a></span>
which came within my own observation. That it was not epidemic is
clearly evinced, from its not extending its influence to those who attended
the sick, nor to the rest of the crew, all of whom escaped its attack and
remained healthy. Among the Dutch who remain in the town, fevers
are, I understand, very prevalent at all seasons, notwithstanding their
being, in a manner, inured to the climate, and most of them have a
sallow sickly appearance. It is not uncommon, in riding through the
streets, to meet three or four funerals daily.</p>

<p>"The Chinese, however, who are very numerous, suffer more than any
class of the people; perhaps, from the worse situations of their houses,
the manner in which these are crowded, the closeness of their apartments,
and their gross manner of living. The number of casualties
among them, I am told, is incredible, especially during the dry season;
and if one may judge from the extent of their burial ground, and the
number of their tumuli, it cannot admit of a doubt. The preceding
facts are, I conclude, sufficient to establish the truth of the noxious
character the climate of Batavia has so long obtained, and I shall now
proceed to the causes which have been often investigated, and seem well
ascertained, though the knowledge of them has led to little exertion for
their removal.</p>

<p>"The baneful effects of marsh miasmata on the human system is well
known, engendering intermittent and remittent fevers, dysenteries, and
visceral obstructions. Batavia, built almost in a swamp, surrounded by
marshes in all directions, trees and jungles, which prevent the exhalations
being carried off by a free circulation of air, is peculiarly obnoxious
from this cause. Opposite the mouth of the river, and extending
a great way to the westward, is a mud-bank, which, in many parts at
low water, is uncovered by the sea, and is daily accumulating from the
quantities of mud and animal and vegetable matter carried down by the
river during its reflux. Again the sea, often at spring tides, overflows
the adjacent country, and, on its receding, leaves the soil covered with
slime and mud, which, exposed to the action of the sun, soon suffers
decomposition, and impregnates the atmosphere with its noxious exhalations,
which are carried by the sea breeze over Batavia, where the
trees and jungles surrounding the houses prevent their being dissipated.
During the heat of the day these exhalations are more diffused and
comparatively innoxious, but when the sun withdraws its influence they
become more condensed, and amalgamating with the descending evening
dews form a morbid atmosphere around the houses of the inhabitants.
This hypothesis will readily account for a fact well known, that
people whose commercial concerns require their presence in Batavia
during the day, and who retire during the night into the country, escape
this endemic, while scarcely any who sleep in the town, even for a
night, unless those who, by a long residence, are inured to it, escape.
In the ingenious and sensible work formerly alluded to (Mr. Johnson's),
I find this hypothesis so clearly and perspicuously expounded, that I
must take the liberty of quoting it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxi" id="Page_mmxi">[Vol II Pg xi]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The cause why the stench emitted by marshes and vegetable matter
in a state of decomposition is more perceptible immediately after sunset,
is not that the vapours are disengaged in greater quantities then
than during the day, but the marshes retain their heat for some time
after the sun's rays are withdrawn, and consequently continue to emit
vapours through the atmosphere, as during the high temperature of
the day by the sun. They therefore meet the descending dews, condensing
and forming a thick fog, which hovers over the swamps,
accompanied by a noxious and disagreeable odour. The miasmata
exhaled during the day, in all probability, descend with the dews
of the evening, which, meeting and combining with those that continue
to be disengaged from their source, must form a concentration
highly capable of affecting the constitution. Marsh effluvia become
at a certain distance from their source innoxious. Dr. Hunter observes,
'a few feet in height gives a comparative security in the same
buildings.' This will be accounted for by the supposition, that as
the miasmata exhaled during the day descend in the evenings, they
become more and more concentrated, till meeting the exhalations
from the still reeking marshes, a dense stratum of highly impregnated
atmosphere is found contiguous to the surface of the earth: hence the
salubrity of sleeping in upper apartments. This leads to another
practicable inference of considerable importance, that when necessity
compels exposure to these marshes, we should select that point of
time least likely to meet those miasmata, whether ascending or descending.
This period seems to extend from three to six in the
afternoon:<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> that is, after the greatest heat of the earth and air, and
consequently the greatest evaporation, and before the condensation
and return of such exhalations as rose during the day, and which
combine with those still issuing from the heated soil for some time
after sunset.'</p>

<p>"A second, and, I think, an equally powerful cause, is the stagnant
water of the canals, which, in all directions, intersect the city. In the
first place, they are filled with filth of every description; there is scarcely
at times any perceptible current in them to carry off that filth; and
lastly, the sluices are frequently kept shut, for the purpose of swelling
the waters above them to irrigate the fields, while those below, which
intersect the town, become almost dry, leaving an extensive surface of
mud, and every kind of putrified matter, to be acted upon by the sun,
raising the most pestilential vapours, with which, as before observed,
the atmosphere gets thoroughly impregnated.</p>

<p>"As a third cause, the state of the houses may be considered, and the
mode of living of the Dutch. Houses that are untenanted are seldom
opened, and thus collect much filth and foul, damp, pernicious vapours.
Those that are inhabited are generally shut up in the day time, most of
them being glazed, thus preventing a free circulation of air; and in the
lower story of most of the houses, the walls are covered some feet from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxii" id="Page_mmxii">[Vol II Pg xii]</a></span>
the ground with a greenish coat, and on entering the apartments a
stranger experiences a kind of chilly feel, and a damp raw kind of
smell. Although it cannot be enumerated among the causes, yet I
cannot help thinking the Dutch mode of medical practice, in as far as
it is inefficient to counteract the diseases of this climate, must tend to
increase the number of fatal terminations.</p>

<p>"The Dutch practitioners, little in the habit of theorizing, continue
the same practice in every form of disease, and they are particularly prejudiced
against the use of mercury, opium, and other powerful medicines,
in consequence relying solely on the most simple and inert remedies.
Some few of them, of more enlarged understanding, adopt the
English mode, and seem sensible of its superior efficacy.</p>

<p>"A fourth, and, I am convinced, a very general cause, especially of the
diarrhœas and dysenteries, which seldom fail to attack new comers, is
the water. This most essential article is taken either from the canals
or wells, and it is equally bad when passed through a filtering stone.
It retains a brackish, hard, unpleasant taste, and if allowed to remain
some time in vessels without previous boiling, generates small animalculæ.
Such, I conceive, are the most probable and principal causes of
the insalubrity of Batavia; though there are, I doubt not, others contributing,
which elude observation. It is generally received, though I
think an erroneous opinion, that the rainy season is the most unhealthy.
The most unhealthy appears to me to be that immediately
after the cessation of the rains; and the older and more experienced
Dutch residents have observed, that in years when there has been a
long continued drought, disease has been more than usually prevalent,
and they look forward with anxiety for the accession of the rains, as the
means of resisting its baneful dissemination.</p>

<p>"Weltevreden, at a distance of not more than three miles, being less
exposed to these causes, excepting the water, is exempt, in a great
measure, from its prevailing endemic fever; though diarrhœas are common,
especially among those newly arriving, but they are seldom of a
serious or alarming nature.</p>

<p>"Among the troops stationed at Weltevreden and Cornelis, diseases
are not more frequent than in the healthiest parts of India which I have
visited; though for some months since the Báli expedition, the casualties
in the 78th regiment have been numerous. At <em>Chemangis</em>, about
twenty-two miles from Batavia inland, a battalion of Sepoys is stationed,
where, from the returns I have received, it appears they enjoy comparatively
good health, and have very few casualties, though a much
larger quantity of rain falls than in the vicinity of Weltevreden. It is
on an elevated commanding situation, and open and clear of jungle for
a considerable extent around."</p>

<p>In support of the opinion which has been given of the general salubrity
of the climate of Java, the abstract returns of sick, &amp;c. among the
troops serving on Java and its dependencies, for the last two years, are
annexed, together with a statement of casualties, in His Majesty's 78th
regiment, while serving on the continent of India and in Java.

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note</span> <em>by</em> <span class="smcap">N. Currie</span>, <em>Esq. Surgeon of His Majesty's 78th Regiment, on the
foregoing Table</em>.</p>

<p>When the 78th regiment first arrived at Java, the men had been long
confined on board ship, living on salt provisions, and were afterwards
exposed, not only to the fatigues and privations incident to actual warfare,
but also to the inclemency of the weather in a tropical climate. All these
causes produced a tendency to disease, and when the regiment arrived at
<em>Surabáya</em> the quarters were bad; and being in the middle of the town,
free access could at all times be had to spirituous liquors. The number
of diseases and of casualties was consequently great; but it diminished
gradually, as the men were successively accommodated with good barracks
at <em>De Noyo</em>. The whole were comfortably lodged in plastered barracks in
March or April, 1813, and in May and the following month a very sensible
reduction of deaths took place, as may be seen by the abstracts of
those months. During the preceding months of January, February,
March, and April, the deaths were numerous, but the greater proportion
was among the men of a detachment of about two hundred men that
joined in January, and continued to be very sickly during those four
months. Almost all the men of this detachment had, when attacked,
violent diseases.</p>

<p>A very remarkable instance of the bad effects of exposure to night air
while asleep, occurred when part of the regiment was sent, in September,
1814, from <em>Weltevreeden</em> to <em>Chemangis</em>, where the barracks were built of
wattled bamboos, and the men lying with their heads to the walls, received
the current of air directly in their heads. Fifty were seized with
a highly inflammatory fever in the course of three days. Delirium was
always the first symptom in every case, and it was necessary to bleed
several of them largely before they could be sent to the hospital. By
referring to the returns it will be seen that almost every increase of sickness
happened after a change of quarters, as in the detachment above-mentioned,
and after the removal of the regiment from <em>Surabáya</em> to
<em>Ung'arang</em> and <em>Sirondol</em> in October, 1813, after the expedition to <em>Bali</em> at
<em>Weltevreeden</em> in June, 1814, and to <em>Chemangis</em> in September 1814. An
increase of sickness always took place after the use of spirituous liquors on
particular holidays, as Christmas, &amp;c.; and on the contrary, the good
effects of not exposing the men to morning dews or wet, and of regularity
in diet, may be seen in the healthiness of the regiment after the men got
settled in good barracks at <em>Surabáya</em> and <em>Weltevreeden</em>.</p>

<p>Java need no longer be held up as the grave of Europeans, for except
in the immediate neighbourhood of salt marshes and forests, as in the city
of <em>Batavia</em>, and two or three other places on the north coast, it may be
safely affirmed that no tropical climate is superior to it in salubrity. By
its insular situation, the temperature of the atmosphere is low and equable,
and from its lofty mountains it possesses this great advantage, that in a
few hours' travelling a climate of any degree of cold may be found.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX B.<br />

JAPAN TRADE.</h2>


<p>The empire of Japan has, for a long period, adopted and carried with
effect all the exclusive maxims of Chinese policy, with a degree of rigour
unknown even in China itself. Previously to the expulsion of the Portuguese
and the extirpation of Christianity in the latter part of the seventeenth
century, the Japanese trade was reckoned by far the most advantageous
which could be pursued in the East, and very much superior to
either the Indian or Chinese trade. After the expulsion of the Portuguese,
a very extensive trade was for some permitted to be carried on by
the Dutch, on account of the benefits which the Japanese imagined themselves
to have received from that nation during the Portuguese war, and
especially the detection of a formidable conspiracy of some of the Japanese
princes to dethrone the emperor, the correspondence relative to which
was intercepted at sea. It was for these services that the Dutch originally
procured the imperial edict, by which they were permitted to trade to
Japan, to the exclusion of all other European nations. This public act
of their ancestors, the Japanese have repeatedly declared that they will
not cancel; but they have done every thing but formally cancel it, for a
more limited and less free trade never was carried on by one rich nation
with another.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> For more than half a century, the Dutch trade has been
limited to two yearly ships from Batavia, the cargoes of both of which
scarcely ever exceeded the value of 300,000 dollars, and their only profitable
returns are Japan copper, and a small quantity of camphor. To
shew themselves impartial in their restrictions, the Japanese have limited
the traffic of the Chinese, the only eastern nation whom they suffer to trade
with them at all, in a similar manner to that of the Dutch, and they suffer
no more than ten Chinese junks to visit <em>Nangasaki</em> in the year. The trade
of those two favoured nations is also limited to the port of <em>Nangasaki</em>.</p>

<p>In pursuance of their exclusive maxims, and conformably to the terms
of their agreement with the Dutch, the Japanese have, on every occasion,
followed an uniform line of conduct, and rejected, in the most peremptory
manner, the various overtures of different nations of Europe,
refusing equally to have any intercourse, negociation or commerce, with
any of them. It must also be admitted, that the whole foreign trade of
Japan, compared with the riches of the country, is absolutely trifling;
nor is there any rich or powerful body of them, like the Hong merchants
of China, at all interested in its continuance. The yearly presents,
whether offered to the governor of <em>Nangasaki</em> or the emperor, are of no
great value, and rigidly limited by law and usage; and as the government
of Japan is much stronger and more vigilant than that of China, no such
abuses can be ventured on at <em>Nangasaki</em> as those which exist at Canton.</p>

<p>The commercial intercourse of the Dutch at Japan was established by
an imperial edict in their favour from the emperor <em>Gonging Soma</em>, in the
year 1611.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxviii" id="Page_mmxviii">[Vol II Pg xviii]</a></span></p>
<p>The first Dutch factory was established at Firando, but in the year
1641 it was removed to <em>Nangasaki</em>. The number of the Dutch ships, and
the kind of merchandize which they imported, were then left entirely to
the discretion of the parties; the merchandize was disposed of to the best
advantage, and the returns consisted of such articles as were expected to
yield the greatest profit. They were subject only to the municipal regulations
of the country, without any further restraint or incumbrance
whatever. The trade remained in this state till the year 1671. In the
Dutch records of this period, the only complaints made against Japanese
authority relate to restrictions laid upon them in matters of religion.</p>

<p>In the beginning the returns from Japan consisted of silver and copper;
and the former being coined, was received according to the current value
in that country, where the coins and weights went by the same name as
in China, viz. <em>katis</em>, <em>tahils</em>, <em>mas</em>, and <em>kandarins</em>. Ten <em>mas</em> were worth a
<em>tahil</em>, sixteen <em>tahil</em> a <em>kati</em>, and one hundred <em>kati</em> weighed one hundred and
twenty, or one hundred and twenty-one, pounds Dutch, equal to a mark.</p>

<p>There were two sorts of silver, of which the fine was called <em>zoma</em>, and
coarser bar-silver, generally distinguished by the Dutch under the terms
of <em>heavy</em> and <em>light</em> money. This was at first carried to account at the rate
of sixty-two stivers and a half per <em>tahil</em>, no difference being made in the
books of that time between the two kinds; but in the year 1635, the common
or bar-silver, was fixed at fifty-seven stivers the <em>tahil</em>. Both kinds,
according to this regulation, were considered by the Dutch as calculated
too high for an article of merchandize, and consequently were not much
in demand in the western parts of India, to which it was at first sent by
the Company.</p>

<p>The attention of the Dutch being, however, afterwards attracted to the
trade in gold from Japan, orders were issued to the factors in the year
1640, requiring gold as a return, to the amount of from ten to twelve
hundred thousand florins. These orders were executed with the best
success; and a wish seems, on this occasion, to have been expressed by
the factory, that Japan might, as formerly, be permitted to supply from
one hundred to one hundred and fifty chests of gold <em>kobangs</em>, <em>ubangs</em>, and
<em>zebos</em>. Gold and silver were, at this time, the principal articles in the returns
from Japan. Their copper was not much in demand, probably
because it was so little known in India or Europe; yet the directors, in
their requisition for the year 1655, state the price of Japan copper having
risen from thirty-six to forty-six florins per hundred pounds weight, and
an order having been sent to Japan for twenty thousand <em>pikuls</em> of that
metal, the same rendered great profit.</p>

<p>In 1644, requisitions were made from Surat for two thousand <em>pikuls</em>,
from Coromandel for one thousand <em>pikuls</em>, and from Batavia for four
thousand <em>pikuls</em> of copper; and in reply it is stated, that it would not be
difficult to furnish the quantity required; that the Japan copper consisted
of both sheet and bar copper, of which the former was purchased at twenty
<em>tahils</em> the <em>pikul</em>, or twelve stivers (inferior silver) per pound, being twenty
per cent. cheaper than European copper.</p>

<p>The gold, after being coined, was found a very profitable article, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxix" id="Page_mmxix">[Vol II Pg xix]</a></span>
purchased at a favourable rate. In the beginning the <em>kobang</em> was purchased
for six <em>tahil</em> eight <em>mas</em>, and for six <em>tahil</em> seven <em>mas</em>; and, as appears
from the books of 1669, 1670, and 1671, was within those years even
purchased as low as five <em>tahils</em> six <em>mas</em>, and five <em>tahils</em> eight <em>mas</em>, from the
great men of the country, or from merchants, according to circumstances.
During two of these years, more than one hundred thousand <em>kobangs</em> were
obtained, which rendered a profit of one million of florins.</p>

<p>In 1671, an edict was issued by the Japanese government, prohibiting
the further exportation of silver; but the profit on the gold being so considerable,
the restriction on the exportation of silver was a matter of indifference
to the Dutch, who still were enabled to obtain their returns in
the more profitable articles of gold and copper.</p>

<p>The exchange of the <em>kobang</em> was now fixed by the Japanese government
at sixty-eight <em>mas</em>; and the free and unrestricted trade which the Dutch
had hitherto enjoyed, was subjected to an arbitrary valuation of the import
cargoes, and limited first with respect to the articles of merchandize, and
afterwards with respect to its extent.</p>

<p>The loss of the island of Formosa in 1661, is supposed to have given
the first shock to the credit of the Dutch at Japan. Not long after that
event they experienced many instances of opposition, and several prejudicial
alterations in the trade.</p>

<p>"They (the Japanese) were consequently," observes Mr. Imhoff, in his
Memoir on the Japan Trade, "no longer under any apprehension of
being annoyed by us, while, if we had remained in possession of Formosa,
we were and might have continued masters of the navigation and
trade between China and Japan. In that opinion I am still further confirmed,
when I consider, in the first instance, that the prejudicial
change with respect to our situation at Japan, although it took place
only several years after the loss of Formosa, had been already in agitation
some time before; and, secondly, that notwithstanding the confidence
of the Japanese in their own superiority, which they always
evinced, that arrogance did not conceal altogether a certain fear of us,
very evident from their great precautions. This fear has, however,
since decreased, and if we may trust to the records, has frequently been
succeeded by brutality.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> It is an undeniable truth, that if a nation
renders itself respected and formidable it will flourish, and that otherwise
it is but little esteemed."</p>

<p>The decline of the trade seems not at first to have been much attended
to. "Whether the Japanese," says the same writer, "at that period
obtained advice of the advantages we derived from the trade, or that the
bad conduct of our servants gave occasion to further restrictions which
succeeded each other, we do not know, yet it is undeniable, that first
in the year 1685 our trade was limited to three hundred thousand
<em>tahils</em>, of which two-thirds were to consist of piece goods and weighable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxx" id="Page_mmxx">[Vol II Pg xx]</a></span>
articles, and the other third of silks. This was confirmed in 1689, and
we were allowed to export only twenty-five thousand <em>pikuls</em> of copper,
whereas our exports of that article formerly had been regulated according
to our requisition. In the year 1700, the number of our ships was
limited to four or five, in lieu of six or seven as were formerly sent, according
to circumstances."</p>

<p>The profits of the trade at this period would yet have deserved attention
had not a change in the current coin rendered the year 1700 still more
disadvantageous. In 1692 and 1693 and afterwards, rich cargoes were
sent to Japan which returned considerable profits, and the funds were
again laid out in copper, as far as thirty thousand chests or <em>pikuls</em>. The
new stipulation of twenty-five thousand chests was of little importance
with the Dutch, who knew how, as they confess, to obtain by bribes from
the governors and their servants a still further quantity. In the year
1685, the system of receiving the Dutch merchandize by valuation was
discontinued; and although it was introduced again in the year 1698, it
was once more abolished in the following year.</p>

<p>Various causes are assigned for the change in the current coin which
took place about this period; but whether, as was supposed by the Dutch,
the knowledge of the Dutch profits upon the <em>kobang</em> opened the eyes of
the Japanese, or that their long intercourse with Europeans rendered them
more attentive to their own interest, or that the Chinese, who are
known to be very expert in the art of coining, proposed that measure
to them, or that the easy compliance of the Dutch in all former instances,
and while they issued the most injurious orders against their
commerce, made them believe that they might purchase their friendship
at a cheaper rate than hitherto, or, as seems most probable, it was
principally occasioned by other and more weighty causes not yet discovered,
it is certain that in the year 1696 appeared, for the first time, a
new kind of <em>kobang</em>, of one-third less in value than the old, although
tendered to and received by the Dutch at the same rate. Here then was
said to commence the iron age.</p>

<p>The new <em>kobang</em> was assayed at thirteen carats six or seven grains, while
the old <em>kobang</em> was twenty carats eight and a half, nine, or even ten
grains; yet the Dutch were obliged to receive the former at the rate of
sixty-eight <em>mas</em> like the old, which weighed thirty-one stivers, and making
a difference upon one thousand of seventy-two marks. The old <em>kobang</em>
rendered a profit of twenty-five per cent., but the new produced a loss of
fifteen or sixteen per cent. on the coast of Coromandel, where it was recoined.
Some of the old <em>kobangs</em> being however estimated at the same
rate with the new, the Dutch still continued to derive some profits from
the gold, until the introduction of a third kind of <em>kobang</em>, denominated the
small <em>kobangs</em>, took place.</p>

<p>In 1710 the Japanese resorted to this further change in the coin, by
reducing the weight of the <em>kobang</em> nearly one half, the value being twenty-five
<em>kanderins</em>, while that of the former was no less than forty-seven <em>kanderins</em>.
This caused a loss of from thirty-four to thirty-six per cent., the
Dutch being obliged to receive the same at the rate of sixty-eight <em>mas</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxi" id="Page_mmxxi">[Vol II Pg xxi]</a></span>
the former <em>kobangs</em>, of inferior alloy only, were in consequence still preferable.
From 1710 to 1720, both sorts were in circulation; but the repeated
complaints of the Dutch were at last, in 1720, so far attended to,
that the old <em>kobangs</em>, of the same alloy and weight, were again introduced.
The latter, however, were called double <em>kobangs</em>, and they were charged in
the Dutch accounts at thirteen <em>tahils</em> six <em>mas</em>, which was twice as much
as in former times, so that they became still less profitable than the small
<em>kobangs</em>, of which two thousand weighed seventy-six marks, while one
thousand of the old coin only weighed seventy-two marks, and would
consequently, when received in lieu of two small <em>kobangs</em>, have produced
a loss of thirty-seven seven-eights per cent.</p>

<p>When an attempt was made, in 1714, to oblige the Dutch to receive the
small <em>kobang</em> at the same rate as the old, the exportation of copper was
limited to fifteen thousand chests, as was the number of ships to two or
three, according to the quantity of copper in store.</p>

<p>A fourth kind of <em>kobang</em> was introduced in 1730, about five per cent.
better than the third or small <em>kobang</em>, but the trade continued rapidly to
decline until the year 1744.</p>

<p>The loss of many valuable ships and cargoes,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> a reduction in the selling
price of the articles of merchandize which they imported, and an increase
of charges attending the visits to the Imperial Court, and the
maintenance of their establishment in Japan, contributed to render this
period particularly disadvantageous to the Dutch trade. Their submissive
conduct at the Emperor's Court was of no avail, nor did their presents
of horses, dogs, and other curiosities, produce any better effect. There
was no longer any possibility of exporting <em>kobangs</em>, as in former times,
for the balance of their accounts. The quantity of copper which they
were allowed to export annually had been fixed in 1721 at ten thousand
chests, yet even that quantity they were unable to obtain in 1743, so
that, together with the high exchange of the <em>tahils</em>, their establishment in
Japan now actually subjected them to a loss, and it was accordingly proposed
at this period that it should be abandoned, unless some favourable
change could be effected.</p>

<p>The charges had considerably increased during the last year. The
cargoes were of less value and of an inferior quality, so that their profits
were reduced to less than one quarter of what they had been: their expences
on account of the Japan trade were at the same time two hundred
thousand florins annually. During the last thirty years their profits
amounted to five hundred thousand, and for some years to six hundred
thousand, but latterly not to two hundred thousand florins per annum.</p>

<p>Thus, to sum up the disasters of this trade, after having been allowed
to remain free and unrestrained for a period of sixty years, the cargoes in
the year 1672 were subjected to an arbitrary valuation, and about the
same time the exchange of the <em>kobang</em> was altered. A tax was laid upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxii" id="Page_mmxxii">[Vol II Pg xxii]</a></span>
the cargoes in 1685, and further increased in 1689. In 1698 the new
<em>kobang</em> was introduced: in 1700 they were limited to four ships annually:
in 1710 an exchange still more disadvantageous was fixed: in 1714 their
exportation was reduced to fifteen thousand <em>pikuls</em> of copper; in 1717 an
order was issued, limiting the trade to two ships only: in 1710 the third,
and in 1730 the fourth sort of <em>kobangs</em> were introduced: and in 1743 the
Dutch were limited to one ship and to one-half of the cargo.</p>

<p>The Dutch, in deliberating upon the measure of abandoning the trade,
in the year 1744, trace all their disasters in this commerce, to their having
tamely submitted, in the first instance, to take the kobang of reduced
value at the same rate as the old one. It then occurred to them, that if
serious remonstrances had been made in the beginning, their firmness
might have prevented the subsequent losses. "In the first instance,"
says Mr. Imhoff, "our commerce was carried on as by a people groping
in the dark, neither knowing the actual price of purchase or sale; because
the <em>kobang</em> being the standard coin of the country, that <em>kobang</em>
ought to have been calculated in proportion to the value of the <em>tahil</em>,
and it would have appeared that since 1710 for forty stivers inferior
silver, thirty stivers superior silver were received, and all articles of
trade not disposed of with a profit of sixty-three per cent. rendered a
loss. And this being the case with most of the cargoes that were sent
to Japan after the period above mentioned, we ought either to have relinquished
that commerce, or had recourse to such means as might
have tended to re-establish the affairs of the Company. Instead, however,
of so doing, fruitless remonstrances and solicitations were employed,
which finally produced this effect, that the Japanese, during the
latter years, granted us, by <em>way of charity</em>, an additional sum of six
thousand <em>tahils</em> upon the sale of our cargoes."</p>

<p>From the deliberations which took place at this period, it appears that
the proposal then under consideration of relinquishing the trade, was rather
intended as a provisional and political measure, to induce the Japanese
to admit them to more favourable terms in future, than brought forward
with the view of finally abandoning or relinquishing the trade altogether.</p>

<p>The public opinion of the time was, that the Japanese had recourse to
these measures of restriction for no other purpose, but to oblige the Dutch
to depart from the country; but it occurred to the Dutch government,
that a nation which treated strangers in so despotic a manner, had no
need to resort to such shifts to dislodge them. Another opinion was,
that the restrictions laid on the trade proceeded from political motives, of
which the first and most important was their hatred against all the different
persuasions of the Christian religion without exception;<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> but the
government were inclined to consider these reasons as deserving of little
notice. "There is no probability," observes Mr. Imhoff, "that, in the
present enlightened age, it can be a consideration, even with the
Japanese, of what persuasion merchants are, who neither attempt to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxiii" id="Page_mmxxiii">[Vol II Pg xxiii]</a></span>propagate their religion with a view to promote their interest, nor to
endanger the safety of the state, of neither of which they appear ever
to have been suspected." The governor-general was further of opinion,
that the Japanese could derive no advantage from the expulsion of the
Dutch, as they would thus be cut off from all correspondence with Europeans,
and thereby become subject to greater inconveniences than at present,
being exposed to the visits of others, whose great increase in those
regions was not unknown to them; for, as he states, it is notorious that
the Japanese government took annual information of all that passed in the
world, and that the Dutch servants had orders to answer their queries
faithfully, in order that contrary reports might not injure their credit, by
which the Japanese were well aware that if the Dutch withdrew, others
would soon settle in the country.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Instead, therefore, of attributing the
conduct of the Japanese to either of these causes, the governor-general
laid it entirely to the account of their interested desire to take every
possible advantage of the weakness of the Dutch, who, by admitting the
first imposition, laid themselves open to all that followed.</p>

<p>In his very able and interesting memoir "On the Trade of Japan and
the Causes which occasioned its Decline,"​&mdash;"It is by no means surprizing,"
says Mr. Imhoff, "that the Japanese, when they altered the
<em>kobang</em>, likewise made a change in the delivery of the copper, observing
that our exchange remained always the same, and the <em>prices of our
merchandize unalterably fixed</em>. We cannot pass unnoticed, that this
wrong calculation has been the cause that, on our part, many valuable
articles of commerce, which were from time to time tendered to us by
the Japanese, were declined. Among those articles was yellow copper
or brass, Japan porcelain, of which musters were sent in 1736, and
camphor, which we might have exported from thence, if our return
cargoes had not been complete. Whether the sovereign right to regulate
the trade of their country is not equally vested in the government
of Japan with any other nation, I will leave undecided. Seeing us
patiently submitting to all kinds of restrictions, inattentive in keeping
our accounts in a regular order, they were encouraged to put us to the
last shift. I am not inclined to dwell upon our surprising indifference,
which was concealed at the same time under the cloak of mystery, from
whence so many evil consequences resulted. I am of opinion, that it
cannot be either the interest or inclination of the Japanese to oblige us
to relinquish all intercourse with their country, provided our trade be
carried on within narrow bounds, and they are not losing upon the
articles delivered to us in payment for our cargoes. It is not possible
that they can have any profit on the copper, if it is sold for less than
one <em>kobang</em>. The mines certainly cannot be worked at a cheaper rate
than formerly; and what profit do the venders of the copper derive
from our merchandize, after it has fallen into the hands of the interpreters
to government and others? Nothing is more natural, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxiv" id="Page_mmxxiv">[Vol II Pg xxiv]</a></span>
than that our exportation of copper from Japan should have become a
burden to that class of people, and that their complaints contributed to
the restrictions to which we are now subject. There is no doubt, that
if the Japanese could keep up the communication without allowing us
a single chest of copper, they would willingly grant us six thousand
<em>tahils</em> as a gratification, over and above the stipulated price for our
cargo."</p>

<p>In considering the reforms to be introduced into the management of
the trade in future, the first point which attracted attention was a better
calculation of the coin, with reference to the intrinsic value, and a calculation
being made upon a new basis, allowed a higher price to be paid for
the copper than before. It was estimated, that if the Dutch could annually
procure twenty thousand <em>pikuls</em> of copper at twenty <em>tahils</em>, the
Japan trade would still be lucrative, allowing the profits on the outward-bound
cargoes to be merely sufficient for the support of the factory.</p>

<p>But in order to purchase and to pay for such a quantity of copper, the
governor-general observes, "it is necessary that government should
strictly comply with the requisitions from Japan, because our failures
therein have brought us into such discredit with the Japanese, that they
do not any longer place confidence in our promises. We have passed
our word from year to year, that the quality and the quantity of our
merchandize should be better assorted, without ever attending to it.
Even at this moment, the supply differs so very much from the quantity
required, that it will be extremely difficult to convince the Japanese
that they shall be better served in future; and still it must be done,
because if we wish to obtain the value of eight hundred or four hundred
thousand <em>tahils</em> of copper annually, besides camphor and other articles,
different measures must be resorted to. We are hardly able, at present,
to supply one-third of that amount, and load the ships with coarse
goods.</p>

<p>"We have no doubt but other productions of Japan might also be procured
at a cheaper rate than at present. Camphor may be purchased in
abundance at thirty <em>tahils</em> the <em>pikul</em>, and it is probable the same could
still be obtained on more favourable terms, if we advert to what it cost
formerly; in which case it would become a profitable remittance to Holland,
and render one hundred per cent., or thereabouts.</p>

<p>"The white copper (tutenague) has been tendered to us at sixteen
<em>tahils</em> per <em>pikul</em>, but has not been accepted, the price being considered
too high. If, however, we can dispose of it merely at the same price
as the yellow copper (brass), which yields according to the price current
before us 41-43 f. per 100 lb., it will not only be acceptable, but
even render a reasonable profit of fifty per cent.</p>

<p>"Iron was formerly imported here from Japan, and might perhaps be
procured at a moderate price, which for the sake of the small distance
between us and that country would be very desirable.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>"Sulphur was also declined in 1726, on account of its being charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxv" id="Page_mmxxv">[Vol II Pg xxv]</a></span>
too high; yet it might still become an article worth attention, especially
if it were purified in Japan. And who knows how many other valuable
productions might be drawn from that extensive country, besides
those already mentioned, and which would be very acceptable, in an
economical as well as a mercantile point of view?"<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>The following facts are collected from the considerations at this time.</p>

<p>That in former times the commerce of foreign nations at Japan
amounted to ten millions of florins, and since then for many years to
3,150,000 florins, of which the Chinese share was two-thirds, and the Dutch
one-third; and it was consequently presumed, that in so extensive a country
as Japan, merchandize might still be disposed of to the value of one
million, especially if it was paid for in the productions of the country.</p>

<p>That one of the causes of the decline of the trade was the conduct of
the Company's servants, and the extent to which the private trade of
individuals was carried. The directors of the trade at Japan had been
selected from a very inferior class of society, and the peculations on overweight
of the copper, &amp;c. formed the subject of a regular complaint made
by the Japanese to the Dutch government.</p>

<p>That the trade of the Chinese to Japan had been reduced from eighty
to twenty junks in the year, the number then allowed.</p>

<p>In concluding his valuable and interesting Memoir, the Baron Van
Imhoff declares it to be his firm belief, that Japan was, in every respect,
what it had been formerly; that the same quantity of merchandize might
be disposed of there as in former times, and that returns of equal value
might be obtained; that although the profits should be less at present,
there could be no reason to relinquish that trade; that the means of the
Dutch were certainly inferior at that moment to what they had been, yet
that if they adhered to the measures proposed (namely, clear accounts,
correctness and honesty of conduct, and a good assortment of cargoes),
which were easy, and could not expose them to any risk or danger, they
might hope for a favourable issue.</p>

<p>In the course of all these deliberations, the Dutch seem to have concluded
that the debasement of the coin was resorted to by the Japanese,
solely with the view of affecting their trade, and never to have reflected
that so important a change in the intrinsic value of the standard coin of
the country, might have been occasioned by political causes, of far greater
magnitude to the Japanese than the paltry gain to be obtained on the
traffic of the Dutch cargoes. It is most probable that the empire of
Japan, at the periods when these changes took place, wished to check the
exportation of the precious metals of the country. In the first instance,
we perceive a prohibition against the exportation of silver. The loss of
this metal was first felt, because the principal exports were at first made
in this coin; but it is never hinted that this prohibition was occasioned
by any desire to take an undue advantage of the Dutch: on the contrary,
this measure was not found to affect the Dutch trade at all. The same
causes, however, which first led to a prohibition regarding silver, operated
afterwards in an equal degree with respect to gold; and it is easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxvi" id="Page_mmxxvi">[Vol II Pg xxvi]</a></span>
account for the rise in the value of this metal, and the consequent changes
in the coin, by the scarcity which ensued. Let us but reflect on the
enormous exportation of the precious metals, which took place from Japan
at the period when the trade was unlimited, and we shall find abundant
cause for these changes in the coin, without accusing the Japanese of
resorting to the measure as an imposition on the foreign merchant. "The
exports at one period," says Mr. Imhoff, "amounted to ten millions of
florins." These were principally made in the precious metals and in
the coin of the country; and when the trade fell exclusively into the
hands of the Dutch, it had been usual to export at first from one hundred
to one hundred and fifty chests of silver, and subsequently the trade
admitted of no less than two hundred chests of gold coin being exported
instead of the silver. On a moderate calculation, therefore, the exports
of the former period were about one million sterling, and those continued
by the Dutch could not be less than from half a million to a million sterling
in each year; so that, during a period of sixty years, the total export
would have amounted to from thirty to sixty millions of pounds sterling,
and this does not include what found its way to China and other neighbouring
countries.</p>

<p>The discovery of the mines of America reduced, in the sixteenth century,
the value of gold and silver in Europe to about one-third of what
it had before been:<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and might not the extensive drain on Japan have
produced in that country an opposite effect of the same magnitude? If
the gold and silver annually imported into Spain and Portugal, which did
not commonly exceed six millions pounds sterling, produced this effect on
the circulating medium, and the price of the precious metals throughout
all Europe, in one country of which alone the circulating gold and silver
amounted, by some accounts to eighteen, and by others to thirty, millions.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
Is it not easy to conclude, that a directly contrary and equally extensive
effect must have been felt in Japan? and that this effect must have been felt
in a still higher degree, while operating on the confined circulating medium
of one nation, than while operating on that of the numerous nations of
Europe, who again found means to dispose of large quantities by remittances
to the eastern world?</p>

<p>The extensive circulation of money throughout the populous and rich
empire of Japan, and the facility with which the drains upon it could be
supplied from the mines, was perhaps the cause that, in the first instance,
the exportation of the precious metals was not sensibly felt; but afterwards,
when probably the mint could not keep pace with the demand, and
what is not unlikely, the demand was even too heavy for the mines, the
intrinsic value of the coins increased in proportion to the scarcity; and it
is not surprising that the Japanese should have entertained an apprehension
lest the mines would become exhausted. Whether there were any
immediate grounds for such an apprehension is uncertain; but it is
generally believed that an edict was issued to discontinue working, first
the silver, and afterwards the gold mines, but not until the nominal, and
perhaps the real, value of both metals, and particularly of the latter, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxvii" id="Page_mmxxvii">[Vol II Pg xxvii]</a></span>been nearly doubled, as in the instance of the <em>kobang</em> of the original value
being offered to the Dutch for two <em>kobangs</em>.</p>

<p>That the Dutch perhaps owe the loss of this valuable trade, in a great
measure, to the incapacity and worthlessness of their own servants, cannot
but be admitted; for had they, on these continued reductions in the value
of the current coins, adverted to the political cause, and calculated their
commercial transactions according to the intrinsic, instead of the nominal,
value, they would not have subjected themselves, unknowingly, to a loss
of sixty per cent. upon the proceeds of all their exports: nor would they
have shewn their weakness and ignorance to the Japanese, but they would
immediately have devised the advantage of other returns from Japan, in
articles, the exportation of which might, at the same time, have improved
the industry and prosperity of that empire; and the Japanese, finding
them equally intelligent and enterprising under all circumstances, while
they felt an interest in the continuance of the trade, would have respected
the nation by whom it was carried on. If, however, by these means, the
European character and the value of foreign trade thus declined in the
estimation of the Japanese, how much lower must that of the Dutch
nation have fallen, when after once dictating the prices of all articles
both bought and sold, we find them obtaining at last an advance on their
proceeds of the outward cargo, by <em>way of charity</em>, and the Japanese themselves
appealing against the peculations and corruptions that were carried
on! When we see the Dutch, without power and without respect,
dictating in the mighty empire of Japan an arbitrary and extravagant
price for their commodities, in the same manner as they did at home, is
it surprising that we should find the Japanese having recourse to a fixed
valuation? When we observe the illicit trade to Japan carried on by
private individuals, to such an extent, that Valentyn, a Dutch author of
the highest authority, says it was so interwoven with the constitution of
the Company, and so extensive, that it formed the principal part of the
trade, and could never be prevented, and that the Dutch ships were frequently
lost by being overladen with cargoes of this kind, we cannot be
astonished at the decline of the prosperity of the Company, or the degradations
which were imposed upon its agents. The Dutch factory was,
and is, in fact, a sink of the most disgraceful corruption and peculation
which ever existed. The factor to obtain his own ends, submits to every
possible degradation, and the government of Batavia knows only just as
much of what is going on at Japan, as it is his interest to tell them. In
this work it has become a painful duty to advert occasionally to the
shameful scenes of fraud and corruption carried on under the very eyes of
the government of Batavia, and in the dependencies in the more immediate
vicinity of that metropolis, where their residents enjoyed such
extensive powers, and were so removed from controul and responsibility,
that their interests constantly interfered with their duties, and the struggle
between principle and opportunity generally ended in a resolution to make
fortunes, to connive at each other's peculations, and keep their own secret.
If this was the case on the island of Java, the seat of government, what
must it not have been in a country so remote as Japan, where the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxviii" id="Page_mmxxviii">[Vol II Pg xxviii]</a></span>nection
and intercourse were so peculiar? It is not surprising, that in
the accounts of such a factory, the government at home should find
nothing but intricacy and obscurity. It was the interest of the factor to
keep every thing involved in mystery, and no where was there a better
opportunity for doing so.</p>

<p>But had the shameful and disgraceful conduct of these people been felt
only in its effects upon the past, it would be trifling, compared to what
they are calculated to produce on the future. The unmanly degradation
to which these factors have submitted at the caprice, and often for the
amusement of the Japanese, in order to gain their own ends, seem to have
established an effectual bar against the future extension of the trade by the
Dutch nation, who will find it difficult, if not impracticable, ever to be
again respected in Japan. Unless, therefore, the Dutch have magnanimity
enough to abandon this trade, when they find it of little comparative
value to them, or when they see it must be conducted on principles
derogatory to the dignity of the illustrious House of Orange, it is to be
feared, that the day is far distant, when the opportunity will be afforded
of opening a liberal and honourable communication between Europe and
this interesting and important empire. Perhaps this will not happen
until, according to Humboldt, the two great oceans shall be united by
means of a channel across the Isthmus of Darien, when the productions
of Nootka Sound and of China will be brought more than two thousand
leagues nearer to Europe and the United States, and when alone any
great changes can be effected in the political state of Eastern Asia; "for
this neck of land," observes that writer, "the barrier against the waves
of the Atlantic Ocean, has been for many ages the bulwark of the
independence of China and Japan."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>From the year 1750 no essential alteration appears to have taken place
in the trade: the utmost exertions of the Dutch were required to provide
the cargoes, and whenever they succeeded, return cargoes were always
provided, to the extent of two or three ships in the year. In order to
afford a better view of the nature and extent of the restricted trade thus
carried on, the accounts of two of these expeditions to Japan are annexed,
from which it will appear, that in the voyage of 1804-5 the Company
exported from Batavia to the Japan market commodities to the amount
of 211,896 rix-dollars in value; that the charges attendant on the shipment
and freight amounted to 167,500 rix-dollars (including 2,915 rix-dollars
on account of customs), making the whole expenses of the voyage,
with the prime cost of the articles, amount to 379,397 rix-dollars. These
articles, when sold in Japan, brought 160,378 rix-dollars; but the
expenses and disbursements at Japan in one year for the establishment,
the loss on the weight of the sugar, and the expense of making the journey
to Japan, reduced that sum to 92,426 rix-dollars. The return cargo
brought to Batavia the sum of 886,554 rix-dollars, or a profit of 507,147
rix-dollars on the adventure. The cargo and return of 1806, and the
expense of the establishment, cost the Company 393,582 rix-dollars,
(including 2,846 for customs), and the sales and other receipts produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxix" id="Page_mmxxix">[Vol II Pg xxix]</a></span>569,089, leaving a balance of 175,505 rix-dollars in favour of the adventure.</p>

<p>A more correct judgment may perhaps be formed from the result of the
adventures undertaken from Batavia during the provisional authority of
the British government. The first of these was intimately connected
with a political object, to which the mercantile adventure was made subservient,
and both were undertaken without those previous arrangements
which would have insured a better assorted and cheaper cargo. The
articles were purchased on the spot and at the moment, and the vessels
engaged at a very high rate of freight. In the first, in particular, the
sugar being of inferior quality, there was a loss in the weight, and it was
otherwise less profitable than it would have been, had the assortment been
of the same quality which the Dutch company were in the habit of sending.
The freight alone amounted to the enormous sum of 82,309 Spanish
dollars. From the outward-bound cargoes it was necessary to pay the
debts of the former government, amounting to 48,648 Spanish dollars;
and this, with other disbursements and necessary provisions, rendering
the proceeds of the outward-bound cargo insufficient to furnish the
amount requisite for the payment of the copper; the Dutch factor
availed himself of the opportunity to supply the deficiency of fourteen
hundred <em>pikuls</em> at the rate of twenty-five dollars per 120⅞ pounds, amounting
to 25,000 Spanish dollars; differing from the rate paid to the
Japanese of 12.3.5 tahils, or ten rix-dollars per pikul, to an extent of
fifteen rix-dollars against government. Besides this, the whole of the
outward cargo was not sold: several articles of merchandize remained
undisposed of at Japan, amounting to 19,688 Spanish dollars, to be
accounted for in the ensuing year. All these operated essentially to reduce
the profits of a voyage, which depended exclusively on the return cargo.</p>

<p>The results of these voyages, however limited as the profits were,
appear fully sufficient to shew the importance of this trade to Batavia,
even as it at present stands, considering that it affords a market for so
large a quantity of the produce of the country, and that when the government
seemed disinclined to send a further adventure on their own account,
there were not wanting numerous individuals anxious to obtain a license
to undertake the trade, and to run all the risks attached to it.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxx" id="Page_mmxxx">[Vol II Pg xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1616, the English obtained a grant from the emperor, containing
the privileges for a general trade with Japan, in consequence of
which a commercial establishment was formed there by the Company.</p>

<p>In obtaining those privileges, one great object with the Company
appears to have been to introduce themselves to a connection with the
Chinese, and to carry on a general trade between India, China, and Japan;
but finding themselves disappointed in their endeavours to form connections
with China, and sustaining heavy losses in consequence of their trade
with Japan, they determined, in 1623, to abandon their establishment
there.</p>

<p>From that time, until the year 1673, no attempt appears to have been
made by the English Company to renew their intercourse with Japan.
The attempt made at that period entirely failed of success, owing, it was
stated, to the king of England having married a daughter of the king of
Portugal. About the same time the Company, with a view to the same
object, formed an establishment on the Island of Hounan; but after
struggling with great difficulties, sustaining heavy losses, and being totally
disappointed in their expectations of communicating with Japan, the
factory was ordered to be withdrawn in the year 1682.</p>

<p>At a subsequent period (in the year 1699), the Company having
established a regular communication with China, their supra-cargoes were
instructed to use every endeavour in their power to promote an intercourse
with Japan, for the purpose of introducing woollens, &amp;c. into that country,
but without any appearance of success.</p>

<p>A select committee of the East-India Company, appointed in 1792 to
take into consideration the export trade of Great Britain to the East
Indies, after detailing the cargo of a Dutch ship from Japan in the year
1664, which consisted principally of copper, camphor, silk-stuffs, and
china-ware, conclude their report by observing, that, in their opinion, the
trade with Japan never can become an object of attention for the manufactures
and produce of Great Britain; for supposing, they observe, that
woollens, lead, and curiosities for a cargo to Japan, could be made to
£8,000, what is to be required in payment? About £30,000 or £32,000
value in copper, an article which is also the produce of Great Britain, and
which must be disposed of in India, to the prejudice of their own mines.
Thus Great Britain would gain, on the one hand, £8,000, whilst the loss,
on the other, would be £32,000.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxxi" id="Page_mmxxxi">[Vol II Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>
<p>This opinion, however, would appear to have been formed on a very
partial view of the subject, and with reference to the limited nature of the
trade as it then existed; but it would be as unfair to judge of the value
of the Japan trade to the British nation from this narrow view, as it
would be to decide upon that subject merely from the result of the adventures
to Japan undertaken during the recent provisional government of
Batavia, which, besides other disadvantages, were, for political reasons,
carried on with a scrupulous regard to the restrictions under which the
trade of the Dutch had latterly laboured.</p>

<p>It is objected to a direct communication with Japan, and the consequent
exportation of British merchandize by British ships, that, in all
probability, it would entirely put a stop to the present exportation of
woollens by the Chinese, and that, in proportion as the exports from
Great Britain to Japan increased, those from Great Britain to China
might be expected to diminish; the Japanese being, at present, almost
exclusively supplied with British woollens by means of the Chinese: that,
however, the demand for teas would continue the same, and therefore the
defalcation in exports to China must be made up in bullion, or by drafts
on Bengal.</p>

<p>It is admitted that the Bengal government might provide for this
additional demand, by disposing of the copper brought from Japan in the
Calcutta market; but this, it is stated, would prove a considerable check
to the consumption of one of the most valuable articles of export from
Great Britain, and therefore it has been inferred, that the final result of
the trade with Japan would, in all probability, be the exchange of our
woollens for copper, which we have already in abundance, instead of
bartering them for teas, which, in the present state of Great Britain, will
be always required.</p>

<p>But this argument seems evidently to have been grounded on a supposition
that copper must always form the principal, if not only, article of
commerce with Japan. An inference by no means borne out by the
history of the Dutch trade; in the course of which, it is expressly stated
by the Baron Van Imhoff, who appears to have given the subject the most
mature and deliberate consideration, and to have been aided by much
local information, that the Japanese would willingly pay a sum of money
to be excused from the delivery of any copper at all.</p>

<p>But admitting that a connection between Great Britain and Japan might
not be attended with all the commercial profits which might be expected
from a consideration of the productions of the two countries, would it not,
in a political point of view, be of the most essential importance to her
interests in China, which are acknowledged by all to be so important?
Might we not expect from the Chinese a more respectful and correct
conduct than has been customary with them, if they knew that we were
in some measure independent of our connection with them? and is it not
important, that in case of our actual exclusion from China, there should
still be a channel open for our obtaining commodities, with which we are
at present supplied by that country?

ships to Japan, but few losses took place; whereas afterwards, when only two or three were sent
and the navigation better known, many were lost. The cause assigned is their being latterly
overladen with private trade.</p></div>

ours is the only European nation admitted to it, what humiliations we are obliged to suffer
for it, and what expenses we incur by our embassies to the court of <em>Jeddo</em>. This trade was
once very lucrative, but in the latter years I think it has done little more than cover the expences
incidental to it, and considering the loss of ships and people, is certainly not such as to
justify an exposure to so many humiliations.
</p>
<p>
"Notwithstanding this, we have not been inclined to resign the trade; nor indeed is it either
necessary or prudent to do so. But I am at a loss to know how the government of Batavia
will be able to account for sending there, in the years 1797 and 1798, a strange ship bearing an
American flag, by way of pretence, though really an English vessel, and commanded by Captain
Stuart, a real Englishman, though possessed of an American pass, although he belonged to
Madras or Bengal. To abandon this trade would be ridiculous, but as it is subject to such
regulations in Japan as it will be hardly possible to get rid of, it may be impracticable to make
it quite free and open. To pursue it on account of the state or of a company will never answer
the purpose. I therefore venture to propose the sale by public auction, to the highest bidder, at
Batavia, of a license or pass for one or two ships, of limited burthen, to trade there, either for
one or more years, as may be preferred. The chief of Decima should be appointed and maintained
by the government, and should act as a kind of consul, and proceed on the embassy to
<em>Jeddo</em>, if it were required. But beyond this, the whole system and regulation of the trade
should be left wholly to the owners of the ships, with the exception of such rules as the
Japanese laws may render necessary with regard to our trade.
</p>
<p>
"The yearly embassies, which are so very expensive, are already dispensed with by the Japanese;
and as they would be useful from time to time, it might be advisable to obtain permission,
for the future, to perform them only once in every ten years, or to have it fixed for each new
resident or consul to undertake it once during his stay.
</p>
<p>
"It will not be easy to obtain any other privileges or freedom of consequence, for whatever
some of our latter servants there may have wanted to make us believe on this point, it is very
clear that the Japanese are very indifferent whether we go there or not, and consider their
permitting us to do so merely as an indulgence on their part. It cannot be doubted, that as soon
as this trade is opened to individuals, they will find means to make the profits of it worth the
risk and danger; and in proportion as these profits become more valuable, the value of the
licenses will increase."​&mdash;<em>Hogendorp.</em>

<h2>APPENDIX C.<br />

TRANSLATION OF A MODERN VERSION OF THE SÚRIA ÁLEM</h2>


<p>There was a certain raja of the west, named <em>Sáng Prábu Súria Alem</em>,
who, being duly qualified, did, in the establishment of divine justice, frame
a code of judicial regulations, consisting of fifteen hundred and seven
articles, which being afterwards digested and reduced to the number of
one hundred and forty-four, were by him made known and explained to
all the people of the countries under his authority, thereby diffusing
knowledge and righteousness where ignorance and wickedness before
prevailed.</p>

<p>These regulations were also firmly established, and were put into practice
without any respect of persons, not excepting the relations and kindred
of <em>Sáng Prábu</em> himself; so that, if the left hand offended, satisfaction
was demanded by the right, and <em>vice versâ</em> for such is the law of God.</p>

<p>These judicial regulations originated in no ambitious views, nor was
their author, when he framed them, influenced by feelings of either regard
for his friends or hatred towards his enemies; neither was he actuated by
any selfish considerations: his sole object was the establishment of true
justice, founded on divine principles.</p>


<h3>I.<br />

<em>Of the Duty of the Jáksa.</em></h3>

<p>In the first place, he must possess a sufficient knowledge of the law, to
know how to act in regard to cases which may come before him, which of
the parties ought to be made to pay, what are and what are not proper
subjects for a law-suit, deciding against the person who would bring forward
any thing of the latter description. If the <em>Jáksa</em> is found ignorant
of these matters, he shall have his tongue cut out.</p>

<p>In the second place, if the <em>Jejénang</em> (the next in order to the <em>Jáksa</em>)
shall, in acting for the <em>Jáksa</em>, prove deficient in a knowledge of his duty,
he too shall either have his tongue cut out, lose both his ears, or have
red-hot pincers applied to his lips.</p>

<p>In the third place, any incorrect statement in writing shall be punished
by the loss of both hands.</p>

<p>Should neither of these sentences be carried into effect, the <em>Jáksa</em> ought,
at all events, to be banished the country.</p>

<p>This punishment, however, may be mitigated by the <em>Rája</em>, who, having
compassion on the <em>Jáksa</em>, may recal him after one year's exile.</p>

<p>Should the <em>Rája</em> suffer to pass unpunished such a total dereliction of
duty on the part of the <em>Jáksa</em>, as stated, difficulty and distress will necessarily
arise in those times.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxxxix" id="Page_mmxxxix">[Vol II Pg xxxix]</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The establishment fixed by <em>Sáng Prábu</em> for the <em>Jáksa</em> consisted of twelve
persons, viz. two <em>Jejénangs</em>, two writers, six <em>Máta Mátas</em>, and two men
whose business is to be in constant attendance on the court.</p>

<p>The fees authorised to be taken by the <em>Jáksa</em> from persons who have
any business to settle, are forty-four  for the <em>Jáksa</em> himself, three thousand
for the <em>Jejénangs</em>, eight thousand for the writers, one thousand for those in
attendance in the court, and eight thousand for and on account of the state.
That for the <em>Panghúlu</em> is left to the liberality of the party.</p>

<p>If the <em>Jáksa</em> shall not conform in practice to what is here laid down, it is
required that he be disgraced and branded in the common market-place.</p>

<p>If any one shall find fault with the conduct of the <em>Jáksa</em>, without being
able to substantiate his charges against him, and shall make the same public,
that person shall be fined agreeably to the rank and quality of the accused,
viz. fifteen thousand (<em>pichis</em>).<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The reason of so large a sum being
awarded is, because the <em>Jáksa</em> is the chief of the <em>Mántris</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Bopáti</em> is, as it were, the door to the <em>Jáksa</em>, the <em>Kabáyan</em> that to the
<em>Bopáti</em>, and the <em>Panghúlu</em> that to the <em>Raja</em>. These four form a body,
through which every thing is minutely investigated.</p>

<p>Let it be understood, that the Raja, who fills so exalted and conspicuous a
situation, is not without something to do. What he says is the result of
observation and deliberation. His disposition and way of thinking is that
which he has received at the hands of the Almighty, who dwelleth where
no one knoweth, at whose hands the wicked will meet with their deserts.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The <em>Tri-rása-upáya</em>, as known among men, comprehend three things,
which are intimately connected with each other, but which, nevertheless,
must not be confounded, viz. 1. <em>Húkum</em>; 2. <em>P'réntah</em>; 3. <em>Kasúsahan</em><a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.</p>

<p>Where a sentence is very severe, or of a nature which will not admit of its
being fulfilled, a mitigation or commutation thereof can only take place, by
a careful consultation of what is written in the book of laws.</p>


<h3>IV.<br />

<em>Of the Dása Wigúna.</em></h3>

<p><em>Dása</em> signifies ten, and <em>wigúna</em>, very powerful, and under this name is
comprehended: 1. Sentence of death; 2. Amputation; 3. Disgrace;
4. Confiscation of property; 5. Banishment; 6. Extorting evidence by
inflicting bodily pain; 7. Getting at evidence by kind treatment and giving
money; 8. Obtaining it by skilful management alone; 9. Compulsion;
10. Letting off from punishment, by receiving a consideration for the
same.</p>

<p>There are degrees of those which are to be known and observed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxl" id="Page_mmxl">[Vol II Pg xl]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.<br />

<em>Of the Gúntur G'ni.</em></h3>

<p>Under this head is comprehended five things, viz. 1. The customs of the
country; 2. The orders of the sovereign; 3. Loss by an enemy; 4. A
change of the Raja and of his orders; 5. Difficult queries given by one
country to another to solve.</p>

<p>Under the head <em>Mal</em> come three things, viz. Water, land, and people.
The water is necessary to keep alive what has been planted in the land.
Mankind take all that comes, good as well as bad.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The term <em>mal</em> properly means cloth, money, and gold; which three
articles, above all others, are the grand and most frequent subjects of law-suits,
that arise out of the various transactions which take place among
men.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>In law-suits there are seven circumstances of material consequence, viz.
1. Where the cause being good can be taken up and supported; 2. When
the articles can be minutely described; 3. When the articles, as well as the
persons, can be pointed out; 4. When marks can be shewn; 5. When the
party suing has been an eye-witness; 6. When all those things happen to
take place; 7. When confession is made of what is the subject of the law-suit.</p>


<h3>VIII.<br />

<em>Of the Precious Stone, and that in which it is set.</em></h3>

<p>To these may be compared the Raja and his people. The former is in
a dependant state. Those who surround him are the <em>Pandíta</em>, the <em>Bopáti</em>,
and the <em>Jáksa</em>: and those immediately entertained by himself are, 1. One
who possesses his confidence; 2. A <em>Jérutúlis</em> skilled in writing; 3. An
interpreter well versed in language; 4. A good messenger; 5. An intelligent
doorkeeper; 6. A person who knows in what a want of manners consists;
7. An experienced general.​&mdash;Then will the country flourish.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The <em>Jáksa</em> is, according to his character, distinguished by the following
appellations, viz. <em>Wíra páksa</em>, when he inclines to the side whence he
receives most bribes; 2. <em>Pátra kilása</em>, when he goes by what he is told,
without duly weighing and considering the merits of the case himself;
3. <em>Ami jáya</em>, when he punishes the guilty with severity; 4. <em>Permána</em>, when
he awards the just sentence of the law as it is written, without lenity or
severity.</p>


<h3>X.</h3>

<p>There are three things which ought not to be allowed to exist in a country,
viz. 1. Witchcraft, particularly at critical junctures. The fine to be imposed
in such cases is forty thousand; and if any thing is lost, it is to be
laid to the charge of the persons who practise that art.</p>

<p>2. Should the <em>Adipáti</em> be the person, he shall be treated according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxli" id="Page_mmxli">[Vol II Pg xli]</a></span>
<em>Sábda suwára</em>, i. e. he shall be dismissed from his office, and his officers
and relatives will be considered as implicated in the crime.</p>

<p>3. Should the <em>Mántris</em> be found guilty of witchcraft, they shall be fined
one hundred thousand.</p>


<h3>XI.<br />

<em>Of the boundaries or Limits of Lands named Túgu.</em></h3>

<p>By which is meant landmarks, such as stones, trees or fences, or whatever
else serves to form an enclosure.</p>

<p>This may and does often become a subject of litigation, especially where
any thing has been planted: 1. With respect to lands of inheritance;
2. With respect to such as have been given away; 3. With respect to
those which have been purchased; 4. With respect to those in which
something has been planted.</p>

<p>Disputes arising on any of those subjects are proper to be litigated; and
in settling them, besides examining such witnesses as there may be, it will
be necessary to consult the old men of the village, as well as the <em>Lúra</em> who
collects the annual land revenue, before a decision can be given.</p>

<p>The true proprietor of a piece of land under dispute, will be he who can
prove his having enclosed it; and the true proprietor of any crop will be
he who can prove his having sown or planted it.</p>

<p>Proof is to be obtained by administering an oath, which is done by immersion
in water, or by drinking it.</p>


<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>He in whose hands is vested the power of administering justice, must be
well acquainted with the nature of the ten following things, and know how
to proceed in regard to them, viz. 1. Informations; 2. Grounds for a law-suit;
3. The proper time for trial; 4. The occupation and condition of the
parties; 5. The object sought by the parties; 6. The prosecution; 7. The
defence; 8. Pleading not guilty; 9. Evidence; 10. Eye-witnesses.</p>


<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>A sufficiency of evidence alone will obtain a favourable decision; and
when the witnesses brought forward to prove any fact do not, upon examination
do so, the party who summoned them ought to be cast and also
fined.</p>


<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>With regard to the <em>Páncha báka</em>, which is the case of a woman accused
by four men of fornication; if, on examination, these four men do not
agree in their testimony, they ought to be put to death, or else fined agreeably
to the <em>Jána trésna</em>, which leaves it to those who have charge of the
woman to determine the extent of the fine.</p>


<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>There are two descriptions of orders, viz. 1. <em>Purúsa</em>, or those which
come from the Raja or from an enemy; 3. <em>paparéntahan</em>, or those of the
<em>Bopáti</em>.</p>

<p>If the <em>Bopáti</em> is more severe or more lenient than he ought to be, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxlii" id="Page_mmxlii">[Vol II Pg xlii]</a></span>
shall be fined one hundred thousand, or else agreeably to the <em>Sábda suwára</em>,
which is the arbitrary will of the Sovereign.</p>


<h3>XVI.</h3>

<p>The following are thirty different cases of law-suits, viz.</p>

<p>1. <em>Amra kádang</em>, where one who is accused of theft, points at either
another person or the accuser himself.</p>

<p>2. <em>Kundáng chíri</em>, where a person presents a paper to the court, with
something additional written under the signature and date of it.</p>

evidence.</p>

<p>13. <em>Sudésit kemú</em>, i. e. a thing belonging to two persons and found by a
third; the point forthwith litigated, and decided in favour of the former,
each of whom hopes to get it: the thing, however, cannot be restored to
either, or to any of their relations; it must be appropriated for the purpose
of assisting in defraying the expenses of the state.</p>

<p>14. <em>Sáksi rumémbi</em>, where a person first of all calls upon only one person
as a witness, and afterwards, when the cause is decided, wishes to adduce
further evidence.</p>

<p>15. <em>Sasástra perálara</em>, where a person presents a written statement of
his grievances without a date to it.</p>

<p>16. <em>Ang'ríka-rája</em>, where a person engaged in a law-suit speaks hesitatingly,
and at the same time refers to some respectable person for the truth
of what he would assert.</p>

<p>17. <em>Chini ropáti</em>, where a person acts in a compulsory manner towards
the people or relations of another.</p>

and keeps himself back.</p>

<p>24. <em>Páncha perkása</em>, where those engaged in a law-suit display rage and
cunning.</p>

the sentence of the <em>Jáksa</em>.</p>

<p>29. <em>Katóya rása úpaya</em>, where a person, before his cause is decided,

<p>30. <em>Kasábda malícha permána</em>, where a person denies what he has once
publicly declared.</p>

<p>With respect to the thirty foregoing cases, it will be for the <em>Jáksa</em> to
consider and determine when a law-suit can, and when it cannot, be instituted.</p>


<h3>XVII.</h3>

<p>Here follow eight more cases, viz.</p>

<p>1. <em>Cupíta sábda permána</em>, where one of four persons engaged in a law-suit,
being deputed to act for the others, it appears, on examination of the
witnesses, that the affair cannot be settled with this one person.</p>

<p>2. <em>Hanúk meng tan wíring wísa</em>, where a witness, on re-examination,
gives a different account from that which he gave when previously examined
by the <em>Jáksa</em>. In such case the <em>Jáksa</em> must endeavour to discover
which is the most plausible account of the two.</p>

<p>3. <em>Kawílut tára</em>, where opposition takes place between the witnesses, or
between those whose cause it is, and others who have been eye-witnesses
of what is the subject of litigation.</p>

<p>4. <em>Bháning hanámpuh tóya</em>, where a person is assisted by one who is in
the administration of justice.</p>

<p>5. <em>Ng'ádang tárka</em>, where, on a trial taking place, the deposition of a

this case, such party should be cast.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxliv" id="Page_mmxliv">[Vol II Pg xliv]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVIII.<br />

<em>Of cases where a Law-Suit cannot be instituted.</em></h3>

<p>These are five in number, viz. 1. Where the evidence is not clear;
2. Where an article which has been lost by one person is found in the
possession of another, who cannot tell whence he got it; 3. Where the
evidence of the witnesses produced by any party varies from that of the
parties themselves; 4. Where no evidence exists. In this case, the party
who can give the most plausible story will obtain a decision in his favour;
5. Where the agent of another in any law-suit is cast.</p>


<h3>XIX.</h3>

<p>A law-suit will be instituted with success under any of the five following
circumstances, viz.</p>

<p>1. <em>Táta</em>, where the declarations of all those who support the suit are
uniform and connected.</p>

<p>2. <em>Títi</em>, when the time of the deed or action is known.</p>

<p>3. <em>Kárta</em>, where the object of the suit is universally allowed to be good
and just.</p>

<p>4. <em>Sang'ára</em>, where there is a readiness to swear to what is asserted.</p>

<p>5. <em>Dupára</em>, where probability and plausibility exist.</p>


<h3>XX.</h3>

<p>Of things sent by one person to another, and destroyed under circumstances
which admit of no redress, called <em>Páncha Sedrása</em>, of which there
are five cases, viz. 1. Where it is occasioned by lightning; 2. When by
the attack of an enemy; 3. By being sunk; 4. In consequence of an order
from the Raja; 5. By fire communicated from an adjoining house.</p>


<h3>XXI.</h3>

<p>There are three things which, from their baneful nature, are universally
deprecated, and considered and treated as inimical to the welfare of man,
viz. 1. Theft; 2. The injury which crops are liable to sustain from the
depredations of noxious animals; 3. The mischief which is to be apprehended
under water, from crocodiles or the like.</p>


<h3>XXII.</h3>

<p>In a law-suit, the successful party obtains damages of the one that is
cast. As the agitation of the leaves marks the presence of the wind, so
does the stir and noise of contending parties shew the existence of a law-suit.</p>


<h3>XXIII.</h3>

<p>There are two cases where it will go hard with any party, viz. 1. When
a mark or proof can be given, as well as evidence produced; 2. Where in
a violent dispute between two chiefs respecting the boundaries of their
lands, one of them is the first to bring weapons with him: such a one
must be found guilty, and will be cast. The fine to be levied, in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxlv" id="Page_mmxlv">[Vol II Pg xlv]</a></span>
case, will, according to the rank of the parties, be one of the following:
1. <em>Utáma</em>, or that awarded to chiefs, viz. one hundred and forty thousand;
2. <em>Díada madén</em>, or that awarded to those of an inferior degree, viz. seventy
thousand; 3. <em>Nésta</em>, or that awarded to the common people, viz. forty-five
thousand.</p>


<h3>XXIV.</h3>

<p>Sentence of guilt will be awarded to any party under the three following
circumstances.</p>

<p>1. <em>Cháya rásmi</em>, where advice has been received from the <em>Jáksa</em>.</p>

<p>2. <em>Príng'ga ráksa</em>, where the assistance of the officers of the court has
been received.</p>

<p>3. <em>Andría ráksa</em>, where a case which has been decided is revived at the
instance of the party that was cast, in consequence of other people's advice.
In such case, if the party which formerly gained the suit fail to
appear on the day appointed for a second trial, they shall be cast; and in
like manner will it be with the other party, if they fail to attend. For such
proceeding, however, the <em>Jáksa</em> shall be fined fifty thousand.</p>


<h3>XXV.</h3>

<p>1. <em>Wilút sábda bíksa masábda upáya</em>, where a person sues another who is
connected with the business of the suit, but who is not the responsible
person, and only from his being the more eligible person is attacked on
account of his means. In such case the prosecutor will lose his cause.</p>

<p>2. <em>Sáka dípa</em>, where a person incurs the obligation of paying for any
thing he has lost or destroyed, and refuses to do so according to a proper
valuation which shall be fixed thereon. In such case he shall be cast.</p>

be found guilty, and fined forty thousand.</p>

<p>4. <em>Bháning máya permána</em>, i. e. if a thief, who is pursued, runs into
certain premises, by a gap in what serves to enclose them, the proprietor
thereof will be held responsible for one-third of the amount stolen.</p>

<p>5. <em>Ng'ámbága páti</em>, i. e. a person having pursued, without effect, a thief
whom he had surprised in the act of stealing, and the tools of the thief,

in the house of any one, the owner of the house shall be held guilty.</p>

<p>6. <em>Lukíta búkti</em>, i. e. the person in whose possession thieves' tools shall
be found, will be held guilty of any robbery which may, at the time, have
been committed.</p>

<p>7. <em>Síma mamángsa táta upáya</em>, i. e. where a person pursues a thief into

<h3>XXVI.</h3>

<p>Of cases where a cause will be lost, there are twenty-five in number, viz.</p>

<p>1. <em>Hína sáksi</em>, where the witnesses are worthless disreputable persons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxlvi" id="Page_mmxlvi">[Vol II Pg xlvi]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <em>Hína sábda</em>, where a thing is lost, and the owner thereof does not give
information thereof to his chief.</p>

<p>4. <em>Hína wang</em>, where a person whom another deputes to act for him, in
any law-suit, is deficient in what is required of him.</p>

<p>5. <em>Kagúndang sáksi</em>, where a witness produced by one party is the declared
enemy of the other.</p>

<p>6. <em>Hang'ímbu chína</em>, where a person who has been robbed gets hold of
the thieves' tools without making it known that he has done so.</p>

<p>7. <em>Ng'edong sáksi</em>, when a person brings false witnesses whom he has
suborned.</p>

<p>8. <em>Hakúto sáksi</em>, where the witnesses have been bribed.</p>

<p>9. <em>Hakádang sáksi</em>, i. e. where a person instructs his witnesses what to
say previous to their examination.</p>

<p>10. <em>Sábda laksána</em>, i. e. where a thing is stolen within certain premises,
and a person residing therein shall refuse to concern himself about the
matter. Such person shall be made to make good one-third of the property
lost.</p>

<p>11. <em>Hamátang bubúkan</em>, i. e. where a person makes one of his enemy's
people his agent. Such person shall be cast.</p>

<p>12. <em>Sídam wárut</em>, i. e. where persons concert in concealing an unlawful
pregnancy and in producing an abortion. Such persons shall incur a fine of
one hundred and fifty thousand each; the whole of the people of the village
where it took place shall each be fined fifty thousand; and every person
of the village opposite to it shall be fined twenty-five thousand. All
persons, too, who, though living at a distance, are still under the authority
of the chief of the village when the thing happened, shall be each fined
four thousand. A person of great means shall be fined one million.</p>

<p>13. <em>Tatarápan raja pepáti</em>, i. e. if a person is found dead without its
being known how he came by his death, nothing can be done; and it will
rest with the Raja to cause the body to be disposed of in any way he may
deem proper. If a corrupted dead body, found in a certain village, is
first discovered by people of another village, the whole of the persons belonging
to the former shall be each fined fifty thousand. Should those
persons have endeavoured to conceal the dead body, they shall each, in
that case, be fined one hundred thousand. If it is in a field where the
dead body is discovered, and that by others than the proprietors of the
land, the fine to be imposed upon the latter shall be one hundred thousand.
If the dead body is first discovered by a person of the village, and he immediately,
by sounding an alarm, summons all the people of that village to
see and bear witness thereof; and if those persons afterwards, on examination,
deny the fact, the whole of them shall be fined fifty thousand. The
favourable testimony of thirteen women, however, will get them off from
the said fine.</p>

<p>14. <em>Ngépi g'ni</em>, i. e. a person is wounded and sounds the alarm: many
people quickly repair to the spot, but see no appearance of any one by whom
the wound could have been inflicted; presently is heard the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxlvii" id="Page_mmxlvii">[Vol II Pg xlvii]</a></span>
another alarm, at a different place, by persons who declare they have just
wounded a thief who has escaped from them, producing at the same time
proof of the fact: in such case the person who first sounded the alarm
shall be considered the thief. If there is found a person who has been
wounded somewhere, but without its being known where or when, and
without there being any thing to lead to a suspicion of his being a thief,
nothing can be done to him.</p>

<p>15. <em>Ang'gús súra</em>, i. e. a wound having been proved to have been inflicted
by any party who has been prosecuted for the same, if the skin only
is broken, the fine to be imposed shall be four thousand. If it is a flesh
wound, the fine shall be eight thousand; if a bone be broken or sinews cut,
forty thousand: but if the injury done to the wounded party be of such a
nature as to deprive him of the means of earning a livelihood, the offending
party must, in that case, provide for him.</p>

<p>16. If a person wounds a thief, and can shew marks of his having done
so (as a bloody weapon), and if it has been done in the presence of many
people, and it has been plainly seen whither the thief betook himself, and
an alarm is presently sounded in the place to which the thief fled, and a
person then declares he has just received a wound, such person shall be
accounted the thief.</p>

<p>17. <em>Wardáya chuménda</em>, i. e. if a person is observed to pass through a
village with thieves' tools in his possession, although nothing be stolen,
that person shall be accounted the thief.</p>

<p>18. <em>Artísi wádía dan dérma dénda</em>, i. e. the disputes of ministers with
ministers, priests with priests, and <em>pundíta</em> with <em>pundíta</em>, must be decided
according to the <em>Wartárja sawung eng kerta</em>, i. e. by taking into consideration
their different dispositions and natures, as well as their proneness to
falsehood.</p>

<p>19. <em>Tríta chándrang guira raditia</em>, i. e. the law (in the inflexibility and
unchangeableness of its nature) resembles the sun, moon, and water.
Whoever acts in opposition to the law, must be found guilty and punished
accordingly.</p>

<p>20. If any person be courageous enough to seize or kill a thief, he ought
to receive a reward of four thousand. If the thief has a master, the latter
ought to be fined twenty-four thousand.</p>

<p>21. If a person enter a village at an improper hour, and is thrice challenged
without making any reply, he shall be considered as a thief. A
person skulking behind a door or fence, under similar circumstances, shall
be considered in the same light.</p>

<p>22. <em>Nóya résmi</em>, i. e. a respectable person who may endeavour to screen
a thief, shall be fined agreeably to the <em>untára</em>, viz. one hundred thousand.
If the delinquent is a person of the middle class, he shall be fined eighty
thousand; if a person of the lower orders, forty thousand.</p>

<p>23. <em>Tri maláni nagára</em> comprehends three things, which are inimical to
the welfare of a country, viz. 1. Corrupt judges; 2. Breach of promise
or agreement; 3. <em>Wígu wigúna</em>, i. e. Where the Raja, or others who are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxlviii" id="Page_mmxlviii">[Vol II Pg xlviii]</a></span>
authority, inconsiderately decide or give hasty orders about any thing,
whereby much mischief never fails to follow.</p>

<p>24. This section is the work of the Púndita, <em>Pagáwan Chínde Guána</em>,
and contains seven articles, viz. 1. <em>Súria wíguna</em>, i. e. the Raja's court is
like the sun, whose refulgent rays spread in all directions and penetrate
through every thing. 2. <em>Anla súria kuntáka</em>, i. e. the displeasure of the
Raja in his court is like the heat of the sun, which causes those who are
exposed to it to faint away. 3. <em>Kasíla trésna perláya</em>, i. e. when sentence
of death is passed on any one by the Raja in his court, it must be carried
into effect, as in the case of <em>Kadúrga sangúra</em>, where a person commits

antúka</em>, where a person forgets himself and wrangles in the court of the
Raja; or <em>Kabérna antáka</em>, where a fight takes place, by which death or

is <em>Tírta prábu táru láta</em>. <em>Tírta</em> signifies water, the qualities of
which are clearness, and a disposition to proceed straight forward, which
nothing will check or overcome. Those who are thus like unto water,
let them be ever so humble and poor, shall not fail to be successful in any
cause in which they may be engaged. The lowly, who are thus successful,
shall have as much cause to rejoice as the rich (<em>prábu</em>), who are the
reverse, shall have to be depressed. The former resemble a stately tree

<p>Persons having forfeited their right of liberty through misdemeanors,
and thus become dependant upon another, pay fifty <em>pichis</em>.</p>

<p>All the above fines might be paid in money, goods, gold, silver, horses,
buffaloes, and other necessary articles.</p>


<h4>THEFT AND ROBBERY.</h4>

<p>A free subject having committed a robbery, he was delivered up (on
detection) to the chief or tribunal of the place to which he belonged; and
if unwilling to restore the stolen goods, or unable to pay the value, he was
to be delivered over to the person whom he had robbed, and made to
serve him as a bondsman: but no claim whatever was enforced upon the
wife or children, who did not, on this account, forfeit their liberty. It was,
however, lawful to deprive a thief of his life when caught in the act.</p>

<p>When a robbery was committed by a person in a state of servitude, the
proprietor of such person's services was bound to pay the value of the
stolen property, or to deliver the person over to the injured party; but
on being caught in the fact, and the thief being put to death, the proprietor
was no further liable.</p>

<p>Robberies having been committed in the day time, were punished by a
fine or by servitude.</p>

<p>If one or more stolen buffaloes were killed in or near a village, and sufficient
proof thereof adduced by the owner, the village people were condemned
to pay the value of such stolen cattle, unless they produced the
thief or thieves.</p>


<h4>HOMICIDE AND MURDER.</h4>

<p>A free person who killed a male dependant, was punished by a fine of
two and a half <em>tahils</em>: one who killed a female dependant was fined three
and a half <em>tahils</em>.</p>

<p>If in an affray between two free persons the one killed the other, and
the offender was seized in the act, he could be put to death by the relations
or friends of the deceased; but if he succeeded in taking refuge with
the head of a village, he was only liable to a fine of five <em>tahils</em> if the deceased
was a male, and three and a half <em>tahils</em> if a female.</p>

<p>When a prince, chief, or petty chief, was murdered by one of his subjects,
the party was punished by death, for having killed his superior.</p>

<p>But a prince or head chief had the right to deprive his subjects of their
lives whenever he chose, though, when one of their sons, either a <em>Menak</em>,
<em>Rang'ga</em>, or other chief, put to death a free person or dependant, he was
bound to pay to the friends or master of the deceased two and a half
<em>tahils</em>, besides a fine for a male person five, and for a female three and
three quarters <em>tahils</em>. These persons were not liable to be put to death,
although caught in the fact.</p>

<p>In case, however, that a prince or chief caused to be put to death a
dependant who was not guilty of any offence for which he deserved such
punishment, the prince or chief was bound to make good half of the
estimated value of the deceased's property, beside being condemned to
servitude, and a fine of ten <em>tahils</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmliii" id="Page_mmliii">[Vol II Pg liii]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Amok</em> being cried, it was lawful for every one to destroy such as ran
<em>amok</em>; but in the event of its being a false alarm, and any one was killed
by the crowd, the person that exclaimed <em>amok</em> was liable to be fined.</p>

<p>In a crowd or assemblage of people, if a dispute ran so high that one
party was killed in the affray, and lay dead on the ground, the offending
party was exempt from fine, but punished by the prince according to the
circumstances of the case.</p>


<h4>ADULTERY.</h4>

<p>A man having received information that his wife had committed adultery,
was restricted from believing it, even if he was told by credible persons,
unless he found her in the act; he might then deprive her of life.
If she escaped, however, and concealed herself among her friends and
neighbours, it was not lawful to put her to death; but on complaint being
made by her husband, she was prosecuted and punished according to the
circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>A man found guilty of adultery was liable to a fine of ten <em>tahils</em>, and the
woman to the same. Being unable to discharge the sum, they were
transferred to the servitude of another, who was willing to pay the amount
of the fine, which was then given to the husband of the adulteress.</p>

<p>An adulteress causing her husband to be put to death was also to suffer
death.</p>

<p>A man having run away with the wife of another, on her being seized
by her husband at their abode, both parties could be put to death; but if
they were not discovered for a length of time, during which they kept
themselves quiet and had begotten children, the adulterer was only liable
to pay, as well for himself as for the woman, a fine of ten <em>tahils</em>. He
was, however, bound to forfeit the half of the children so begotten for
the benefit of the lawful husband, to whom they were transferred in servitude.</p>


<h4>DIVORCE.</h4>

<p>Lawfully married persons wishing to separate from each other, each retook
the property brought at the marriage, and an equal division was
made of what had been gained since the marriage. This included the
children; the eldest was always to remain with the mother, the second
with the father. After the separation on the decease of either, the whole
effects were to be taken possession of by those children who, at the separation,
had come to the share of the deceased; but they were also
obliged to pay the debts of the deceased, whatever the same might amount
to. When the number of children was unequal, the odd one was to fall
to the share of the wife; but such as were imperfect or deformed were
excluded from the division, and maintained by both parties.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX, D.<br />

PROCLAMATION.</h2>


<p>For the satisfaction of the inhabitants and people of Java, the following
provisions are made public, in testimony of the sincere disposition
of the British government to promote their prosperity and welfare.
The refusal of their late government to treat for their interests, although
disabled by the events of war from affording them any further protection,
has rendered the consequent establishment of the British authority unconditional.
But an English government does not require the articles of
a capitulation to impose those duties which are prompted by a sense of
justice and a beneficent disposition. The people of Java are exhorted to
consider their new connection with England as founded on principles of
mutual advantage, and to be conducted in a spirit of kindness and affection.</p>

<p>Providence has brought to them a protecting and benevolent government;
they will cheerfully perform the reciprocal duties of allegiance and
attachment.</p>

<p>1. His Majesty's subjects in Java will be entitled to the same general
privileges as are enjoyed by the natural-born subjects of Great Britain in
India, subject to such regulations as now exist, or may hereafter be provided,
respecting residence in any of the Honourable Company's territories.</p>

<p>2. They will have the same privilege and freedom of trade to and with
all countries to the east of the Cape of Good Hope, and also with His
Majesty's European dominions, as are possessed by natural-born subjects
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>3. Dutch gentlemen will be eligible to all offices of trust, and will enjoy
the confidence of government, according to their respective characters,
conduct, and talents, in common with British-born subjects.</p>

<p>4. The vexatious system of monopoly, which is understood to have
heretofore prevailed, in some instances to an oppressive and inconvenient
extent, will be revised, and a more beneficial and politic principle of administration
win be taken into consideration as soon, and to such extent,
as full information on the subject can be obtained, as established usage
and habit may admit, and as may be consistent with a due regard to the
health and morals of the people.</p>

<p>5. The Dutch laws will remain provisionally in force, under the modifications
which will be hereinafter expressed, until the pleasure of the
supreme authorities in England shall be known; and it is conceived that
no material alteration therein is to be apprehended.</p>

<p>The modifications to be now adopted are the following:</p>

<p>First. Neither torture nor mutilation shall make part of any sentence to
be pronounced against criminals.</p>

<p>Secondly. When a British-born subject is convicted of any offence, no
punishment shall be awarded against him, more severe than would be
inflicted by the laws of England for the same crime. And in case of doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlv" id="Page_mmlv">[Vol II Pg lv]</a></span>
concerning the penalty by English law, reference shall be made to the
Honourable the Recorder of Prince of Wales' Island, whose report shall
be a sufficient warrant for awarding the penalty stated by him to be agreeable
to the laws of England. No sentence against any British-born subject,
for any crime or misdemeanor, shall be carried into execution, until
a report shall have been made to the lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>Thirdly. No sentence of death against any person whatever shall be
carried into execution, until report shall have been made to the lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>Fourthly. The lieutenant-governor will have the power of remitting,
moderating, or confirming, all penalties; excepting inconsiderable fines,
short imprisonment, or slight corporal punishment.</p>

<p>Fifthly. British-born subjects shall be amenable to the jurisdiction of
the Dutch tribunals, and to the Dutch laws in all cases of civil complaint
or demands, whether they be plaintiffs or defendants.</p>

<p>Sixthly. All British-born subjects shall be subject to the regulations of
police, and to the jurisdiction of the magistrates charged with the execution
thereof, and with the maintenance of the peace and of public tranquillity
and security.</p>

<p>Seventhly. All persons belonging to or attached to the army, who are
by their condition subject to military law, shall, for the present, be tried
for any crimes they may commit only by courts-martial, unless sent by the
military authorities to civil courts.</p>

<p>Eighthly. It being necessary in all countries that a power should exist
of forming regulations in the nature of legislative provisions, adapted to
change of circumstances, or to meet any emergency that may arise, and the
great distance of the British authorities in Europe rendering it expedient
that the said power should, for the present, reside in some accessible
quarter, it is declared, that the lieutenant-governor shall have full power
and authority to pass such legislative regulations, as, on deliberation, and
after due consultation and advice, may appear to him indispensably necessary,
and that they shall have the full force of law. But the same
shall be immediately reported to the governor-general in council in Bengal,
together with the lieutenant-governor's reasons for passing the said regulation,
and any representations that may have been submitted to him
against the same; and the regulations so passed will be confirmed or disallowed
by the governor-general in council with the shortest possible delay.
The mode in which the lieutenant-governor shall be assisted with
advice will hereafter be made known, and such regulations will hereafter
be framed as may be thought more conducive to the prompt, pure, and
impartial administration of justice, civil and criminal.</p>

<p>Regulations respecting the paper currency, as well as the relative value
of coins circulating in Java, will be published in a separate paper of this
date.</p>

<p class="center">Done at Molenvliet, the 11th September, 1811.<br />

<h3>REGULATION,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1814,
PASSED BY THE HON. THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR IN
COUNCIL,
<em>On the 11th of February, 1814</em>,
FOR THE MORE EFFECTUAL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
IN THE
PROVINCIAL COURTS OF JAVA.</h3>

<p>The Honourable the Lieutenant Governor in Council being deeply impressed
with the necessity of framing one adequate, impartial, and consistent
code, for the prompt and equitable administration of justice, in the
provincial courts of this island, with a view to give to all ranks of people
a due knowledge of their rights and duties, and to ensure to them an enjoyment
of the most perfect security of person and property, has been
pleased that the following regulation be enacted; which, by assuming as
its basis, rather the ancient usages and institutions of the Javans, than
any new innovations founded on European systems of internal government,
may confidently be expected to be, at once the most pleasing to
them, and the best adapted to the existing state of their society.</p>

<p>1. The Resident shall be the Chief Judge and Magistrate in his districts;
but the administration of police and justice, in the towns of Batavia,
<em>Semárang</em>, and <em>Surabáya</em>, shall, as heretofore, be entrusted to the
particular Magistrates and other officers appointed by government for
those places.</p>

<p>2. The <em>Bopátis</em>, or chiefs of districts, and all other public officers, who
may be retained to carry on the duties of this department, are placed
under the immediate authority and control of the Resident himself, or of
his Deputy duly empowered by him. These various duties, whether relative
or direct, will be clearly defined in the course of the following sections.</p>

<p>3. To render more easy the attainment of justice, and to carry on better
the general police of the country, a subordinate jurisdiction shall be constituted
in the following manner.</p>

<p>4. The Residency shall be divided into such number of districts, as extent
of land, population, former custom, or other circumstances may
render necessary. Each of these shall be consigned to the care of a <em>Bopáti</em>,
or native chief, with such an establishment, as being deemed by the Resident
adequate to the purpose, and by him submitted to government, shall
have received their sanction.</p>

<p>5. These districts, again, shall be subdivided into divisions, the extent
and limits of each of which will be clearly marked out and made known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlvii" id="Page_mmlvii">[Vol II Pg lvii]</a></span>
Their size must, of course, entirely depend on the greater or less propinquity
of the villages they contain, and on the more or less numerous population
by which these are inhabited; but, generally speaking, no division
shall be less than ten, or more than twenty, square miles in extent. It
must also be observed, that the limits of the division follow those of the
villages; it being quite contrary to a system of good police, that inhabitants
of the same place should be subject to different authorities.</p>

<p>6. In each division there shall be fixed a station of police, to which
shall be appointed a competent officer, with such number of inferior
<em>Mántris</em>, <em>Peons</em>, &amp;c. as shall be deemed necessary for the execution of the
various duties allotted to his office, and the due maintenance of the tranquillity
of his division.</p>

<p>7. In each village there shall be a Head-man (whether recognized under
the name of <em>Penting'gi</em>, <em>Bakal</em>, <em>Lurah</em>, <em>Kuwu</em>, <em>Mandor</em>, or otherwise, according
to the custom of the country), to be freely elected by the inhabitants
of the village itself from among themselves; the only requisites on
the part of government being, that he actually reside and hold land in it.
Should any of these be found unfit to carry on their respective duties, or
other good objection arise to their being continued in the posts they hold,
a representation to such effect will be made by the Resident to the villagers,
who will accordingly proceed to the nomination of some other person,
who, if approved of by the Resident, shall then receive his confirmation.</p>

<p>8. These Head-men shall, in every respect, be considered as the representatives
of the villages, and shall be held responsible for all such acts
committed within them, as fall justly under that controlling and preventive
power vested in them by their fellow-inhabitants.</p>

<p>9. This mode of election and consequent power, it must be observed,
are no new introductions, but subsist in immemorial usage, and their
nature and limits are well understood by the Javans throughout the island.</p>

<p>10. The Heads of villages will receive and carry into execution all such
orders as government, either directly by the Resident, or through the
medium of the <em>Bopátis</em> and officers of divisions, may be pleased to issue
to them; and they will furnish, at all times, such oral or written information
as may be required from them.</p>

<p>11. The care of the police, in their respective villages, shall be entrusted
to their charge; and for the due preservation of peace, the prevention of
offences, and the discovery and arrest of offenders, they are required to be
particularly careful that a sufficient night watch be regularly maintained.
For this purpose they are authorized to require each of the male inhabitants
to take his turn in the performance of this duty; and, at any time,
to call on all to aid in the pursuit and apprehension of offenders, or to
execute generally any of the other duties that may occur.</p>

<p>12. The Heads of villages will also be held responsible for the amount
of all property belonging to travellers, which may be lost within their
villages, provided, however, that the same shall have been placed under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlviii" id="Page_mmlviii">[Vol II Pg lviii]</a></span>
their charge; and they are required to take charge of all travellers' property
which may be brought to them for that purpose.</p>

<p>13. They are directed to keep a register of all persons under their
authority, describing the name, age, country, occupation, size, and appearance
of each individual, with any other remarks that may be deemed necessary.
They will also, with the assistance of the village priest, form a
register of the births, marriages, and deaths, which occur within their
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>14. These will be drawn up every six months, according to forms to be
furnished to them by the Resident. A copy of each will be retained in the
village, and another will be forwarded to the police officer of the station,
to be kept by him as records, and to furnish the grounds of such reports
as he may be called on to give in.</p>

<p>15. Whenever a stranger arrives for the purpose of settling in a village,
or any one of its former inhabitants absconds, the head of it is required to
furnish immediately to the officer of the division a detailed account of the
particulars relative to either circumstance, who will accordingly take such
measures for the apprehension or pursuit of either, or forward such intelligence
to his superiors, as the case may require.</p>

<p>16. Any person producing the express permission of the Resident, shall
be allowed to settle in a village; but without this, or unless he can procure
two respectable inhabitants to become securities for his good behaviour,
he shall not be permitted to do so.</p>

<p>17. As well heads of villages as officers of divisions are required to keep
a watchful eye upon all new settlers, to ascertain, if possible, their several
characters, from their former places of abode; and to observe, most particularly,
the conduct of such individuals as have no ostensible means of
earning a livelihood. They will, too, follow vigilantly the motions of
armed persons, preventing them, as much as they can, from travelling
together in large bodies; and, as far as may be practicable, they ought
to hinder individuals of every description, but most especially such as are
armed with spears, swords, &amp;c. from travelling at all after eight o'clock at
night.</p>

<p>18. After this hour they are authorised to stop, and detain in their custody
till the next morning, all such persons as may, by having with them
more than usual property, or in any other way, justly give grounds for
suspicion. But on a summary examination, should nothing further appear
against them, they must, on no account, keep them detained beyond
eight o'clock the next morning; nor ought detention at all to take place,
if the account they first give of themselves be deemed satisfactory.</p>

<p>19. Should any thing further appear against them by complaint or otherwise,
they will then be proceeded with as with other accused persons, relative
to whom directions will be given in a subsequent section.</p>

<p>20. In the above case only, it is competent to the officers of police to
apprehend any person of their own authority, unless detected in the actual
perpetration of crime; or to release any person once apprehended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlix" id="Page_mmlix">[Vol II Pg lix]</a></span></p>

<p>21. It having been represented, that though when the inhabitants are
settled in one place, in habitations contiguous to each other, the duty of
the head of a village becomes easy of execution, yet that it is extremely
difficult for him to perform it adequately, when, from caprice or other
cause, any of its members are allowed to leave the main part, or <em>désa</em>, to
go and reside in lonely and remote spots, forming thereby small settlements
of two or three cottages only together, termed <em>dukus</em>, which being
necessarily, from their distance, without the guard of night watches, &amp;c.
must frequently become liable to be attacked and plundered, or more often,
perhaps, from the absence of all controul, will themselves form the resort
and shelter of robbers and other abandoned characters; and, on the other
hand, it not being wished to repress too much this out-settling, as by the
creation of new villages (which must owe their formation to such small
beginnings), a great part of the land, at present waste, may be brought
into cultivation; it is ordered, that the following be the line of conduct to
be observed in these cases.</p>

<p>22. The head of a village shall, in every instance, report to the officer
of division when such an out-settlement takes place; who shall then proceed
to the spot, and forming a committee of three heads of villages (not
to include the one in which the circumstance occurred) shall judge whether
or not it be expedient, for the benefit of agriculture, to permit its continuance,
and measures shall be taken accordingly. If the new settlement be
allowed to remain, a vigilant eye must be kept over its infant state, both
by the officer of division and head of the neighbouring village; and when
it shall have grown to a size that may admit of this, it ought to be separated
from the authority of the mother village, and a similar constitution
be bestowed on it.</p>

<p>23. It is the duty of heads of villages, generally, to preserve tranquillity,
as far as their authority extends, to obey zealously the orders of their superiors,
to furnish every useful information, and, in short, to contribute
all in their power to the establishment and preservation of a good state of
police.</p>

<p>24. Their rewards for this will be a certain portion of land in each village,
and the favouring eye and protection of government.</p>

<p>25. The police officers of divisions are to be considered as immediately
under the authority of the <em>Bopátis</em>. They will furnish to these all such
accounts, reports, &amp;c. as may be required, and will act always on the
orders received from them, or, of course, directly from the Resident himself.</p>

<p>26. To the <em>Bopátis</em>, or chiefs of districts, they will forward every six
months abstract accounts of births, marriages, and deaths which have
occurred in their division, and of the general state of cultivation and
population, with such remarks accompanying them as may seem requisite.</p>

<p>27. Of these and other papers forms will be furnished them, and they
will prepare them from the general account obtained from heads of villages,
whom they will, at any time, require to supply them with such further information
as may be deemed necessary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlx" id="Page_mmlx">[Vol II Pg lx]</a></span></p>

<p>28. On every Saturday they will give in to the <em>Bopáti</em>, or chief of the
district, a detailed statement of the occurrences of the preceding week, the
crimes committed, offenders apprehended, number of new settlers, their
employment, from whence arrived, what individuals have emigrated,
causes of emigration, and, in short, whatever has happened out of the
common track of occurrences.</p>

<p>29. The officers of divisions shall be held responsible for the due administration
of the police within their respective jurisdictions; and to
enable them better to execute their assigned duties, the heads of villages
are placed immediately under their authority. They shall accordingly be
watchful that these vigilantly and zealously perform such services as may
be allotted to their situation; and they shall report fully to the <em>Bopáti</em> of
the district, on the conduct of any heads of villages who may prove neglectful
of their charge, or in any way appear remiss in the execution of the
duties entrusted to them.</p>

<p>30. They shall, on no account, exert their police authority in any undue
interference with the collection of the revenues, that being considered a
distinct department, to which they will only render their assistance when
called upon under the distinct rules laid down in another Regulation for
the guidance of their conduct in it; here only it is considered that they
are to lend their aid at such times, and in such manner, as may be expressly
pointed out to them in orders from their superiors. But they are
at all times, on a regular application being made to them by the inferior
officers of revenue, to take charge of, and give effectual escort to, treasure
passing from or through their divisions; and after receipt of the same,
they will be held responsible for it until such treasure shall have been by
them delivered to the next constituted authority.</p>

<p>31. The <em>peons</em>, and other inferior servants attached to their offices, shall,
of course, be employed in the serving summonses, apprehending offenders,
giving escort, and in other regular duties; but when not in any way thus
engaged, they shall, as leisure admits, be sent to make the rounds of the
division; acquiring, by this means, not only competent information of
all that is transacted within it, but serving also, by this occasional and
uncertain visitation, materially to prevent the undertaking of nefarious
acts.</p>

<p>32. As before observed, the officers of divisions, and those subordinate
to them, shall only, of their own authority, apprehend such persons as are
taken actually in the commission of crime. They are never empowered to
seize others (with the exception of those mentioned in Section 18 of this
Regulation) but when a written order for that purpose has been received
from their superiors, or when a regular charge of an original nature has
been given in against them by any respectable individual.</p>

<p>33. In these cases, they will take suitable measures for the apprehension
and securing of the persons complained of; and when once apprehended,
they will, on no account of their own authority, again liberate them.</p>

<p>34. Should the persons have been so arrested in consequence of orders
received to that effect, the officers of divisions will, in forwarding them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxi" id="Page_mmlxi">[Vol II Pg lxi]</a></span>
their destinations, be careful to observe such instructions as they may have
received on the subject.</p>

<p>35. But should the prisoners have been apprehended on complaints, or
other proceedings originating in the division itself, they will, on their
arrival at the police station, cause to be written a clear and summary statement
of the offence alleged, and of the facts in the case which have come
under their observation, whether witnessed by themselves, or borne testimony
to by any persons present.</p>

<p>36. They will then, with this statement accompanying, forward under
a sufficient guard the prisoner or prisoners, together with the persons complaining
or aggrieved, and the witnesses of the facts, towards the chief
town of the district where the <em>Bopáti</em> resides.</p>

<p>37. Under no pretence whatsoever, shall any persons be detained at the
police station longer than twenty-four hours after their arrest.</p>

<p>38. Should the division in which the arrest has taken place be not that
in which the chief town of the district is situated, the officers of it shall
make over the charge of persons and papers to the police officers of the
division next in the way; and, in similar manner, they shall be forwarded
on from station to station, to the chief town of the district, or from thence
to the principal seat of the residency.</p>

<p>39. In this transmission, the officers of divisions will take particular
care that as little delay as possible occur; any unnecessary infringement on
the personal liberty of the subject, being that of which this government
will ever be most jealous.</p>

<p>40. Whenever a human body is found dead, of which it is not certainly
known that the death was natural, or even though such illness precede it
as might be considered as possibly the cause, should any suspicious circumstances
or appearances attend the death, it will become the duty of the
head of the village in which this may occur, to take cognizance of the
fact; and ordering it so that every thing remain in the state first found, he
shall report the circumstances, without delay, to the officer of the division,
who will immediately appoint a commission of three heads of villages,
assisted by himself or officers, to proceed to the actual spot where
the body lies, and there make due inquiry into every particular that may
serve to elucidate the affair. For this purpose, such evidence will be taken
as may, in any way, be thought to bear on the subject.</p>

<p>41. When the investigation is completed, the persons appointed for the
inquest shall deliver to the officer of division a statement of what they have
done, seen, or heard, and annex to it the opinion they have finally formed
of the manner of death, or degree of guilt any where attaching.</p>

<p>42. The officer of division shall forward this statement, without delay,
to the superior authorities; from whom, in return, he will receive instructions.</p>

<p>43. But should any degree of guilt be imputed, in the opinion expressed
by the commissioners acting on this inquest, the officer of division shall,
without loss of time, proceed to apprehend the suspected person or per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxii" id="Page_mmlxii">[Vol II Pg lxii]</a></span>sons,
and take such other measures upon that opinion, as he would, had a
complaint to the same effect been regularly lodged.</p>

<p>44. As it is most necessary that the cultivators of the soil, and other
industrious inhabitants of a village, should not, on every frivolous or
inconsiderable occasion, be taken away from their labours to attend a distant
seat of justice, where, even though it be more equitably and impartially
administered, the benefit of this is, in many cases, quite counterbalanced
by the loss of time and expenses of the journey and suit,​&mdash;it is
ordered, that there be a subordinate jurisdiction constituted, by means of
which the distribution of justice will be rendered far more easy to the
governing power, and the acquisition of redress will be presented to every
one aggrieved, with the greatest facility, and the least possible expense of
money or time.</p>

<p>45. The heads of villages are required to look on themselves, and to act
with regard to the persons under their controul, as fathers of families; to
maintain, to the extent of their power, a spirit of harmony and tranquillity
in the villages entrusted to them; to curb every approach to feud and litigation;
and, with the aid of their officers, to interpose their authority in
settling, with justice and impartiality, all such petty quarrels as may arise
among the inhabitants.</p>

<p>46. Should, however, the dispute be of sufficient magnitude to entitle it
to higher consideration, courts are regularly established to which it may
be referred.</p>

<p>47. The officers of division shall, at least once a week, or oftener, attend
in some open place at the station of police, with their <em>mantris</em>, or other
subordinate servants, for the purpose of inquiring into and deciding on all
such complaints as may be given in to them, for petty offences committed
within their divisions, as abusive language and inconsiderable assaults or
affrays.</p>

<p>48. These, if satisfactorily proved, they shall be authorized to punish,
by fine not exceeding ten rupees, of which fine the one-half shall be given
to the individual or individuals aggrieved, the other be carried to the account
of government.</p>

<p>49. They shall also be empowered to hear and determine on all such
petty civil cases as may be referred to them, provided the amount at issue
exceed not the sum of twenty rupees.</p>

<p>50. And further, they shall investigate the trifling disputes that may be
brought before them about trespass, nuisance, the irregular distribution of
water, encroachment on boundaries, and other such minor grievances of
usual occurrence in villages.</p>

<p>51. Whether civil or criminal, they shall not, in any case, be authorized
to arrest or imprison.</p>

<p>52. But the complaint having been given in, the person complained of,
if not present, shall be summoned to appear by the next day of sitting,
when the cause shall be heard and decided on without delay. In failure
of attendance on the part of the plaintiff, the case shall be dismissed; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxiii" id="Page_mmlxiii">[Vol II Pg lxiii]</a></span>
the part of the defendant, the cause shall be proceeded with <em>ex parte</em>. The
sentence, whatever it may be, shall be carried into execution, by means of
the authority vested in the heads of villages.</p>

<p>53. Should any persons refuse to obey their award, they shall be committed
for trial before the Resident, who will not only cause the original
sentence to be carried into execution, but, at his discretion, order a punishment
suited to their contumacy.</p>

<p>54. An appeal may be made in the usual manner, in civil cases, from
the officer of the Division's Court to that of the <em>Bopáti</em> at the chief town
of the district; and any complaint for unjust or arbitrary proceeding, on
the part of the subordinate police officers, will likewise be received there.</p>

<p>55. Of every proceeding of this court a regular record shall be kept;
one copy to remain at the police station, and another to be forwarded to
the chief of the district.</p>

<p>56. A fee of half a rupee from each party shall be levied prior to hearing
the cause, to be divided among the officers of police; and ten per cent. on
the amount of the sentence in civil cases is, according to the custom of the
country, to be taken from the loser of the suit, to be carried to the account
of government.</p>

<p>57. The officers of divisions will be held fully responsible for a zealous
and conscientious discharge of the important duties entrusted to them,
and shall meet with exemplary punishment, in the case of any negligence
or corruption being established against them.</p>

<p>58. To the <em>Bopátis</em>, or heads of districts, is consigned the general superintendance
and care of their respective districts. But as these high
officers must frequently be required to attend at the place where the Resident
himself lives, that their districts may not suffer any inconvenience
from their absence, they are empowered to delegate their full authority to
their deputies, or <em>Pátehs</em>, who shall preside in their courts, and issue and
receive orders, in every respect, like themselves.</p>

<p>59. They shall, every six months, furnish to the Resident abstract accounts
of the state of cultivation and population within their districts,
according to forms which will be given to them, and accompanied with
such remarks as may suggest themselves.</p>

<p>60. On every Monday morning they shall deliver to the Resident a detailed
statement of the proceedings of the foregoing week, containing an
account of new settlers, persons emigrated, offences committed, offenders
apprehended, and in short, of every thing remarkable.</p>

<p>61. The heads of districts shall receive all orders directly from the Resident,
and take due measures for carrying them into immediate execution.
The officers of divisions, heads of villages, and all other police servants
within the district, are placed immediately under their control; and they
will most vigilantly watch over the conduct of them, reporting instantly
to the Resident every instance of negligence or crime that may fall under
their observation.</p>

<p>62. They will be open to receive complaints or petitions of every de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxiv" id="Page_mmlxiv">[Vol II Pg lxiv]</a></span>scription;
reporting and issuing the necessary orders on them without
delay.</p>

<p>63. In forwarding persons apprehended within their districts to the seat
of the residency, they will be particularly careful that the least practicable
delay occur; no prisoner, on any account, being detained by them, of
their own authority, for a longer space of time than twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>64. In forwarding persons, papers, or treasure, they will observe the
mode prescribed in Section 38 of this Regulation.</p>

<p>65. On the receipt of an inquest report from the officers of divisions, it
shall be submitted to the chief <em>Jáksa</em> and <em>Panghulu</em> of the district for their
opinion, and on this opinion the necessary measures shall be taken.</p>

<p>66. At the chief town of each district a regular court shall be established,
in which the <em>Bopáti</em> or, in his absence, the <em>Páteh</em>, shall preside,
assisted by the <em>Jáksa</em>, <em>Panghulu</em>, and other law officers appointed.</p>

<p>67. This court shall be held in some open spot in the town, at least
twice a week, or oftener, if necessary.</p>

<p>68. Its authority shall, however, be confined entirely to civil matters;
all cognizance of criminal cases, beyond that already allotted to the officers
of divisions, being vested solely in the court where the Resident himself
presides.</p>

<p>69. In the <em>Bopáti's</em> court shall be received appeals from those of the
officers of divisions, on institution of which the appellants shall pay a fee
of one rupee.</p>

<p>70. Before deciding on these causes, the record of the former trial shall
be read, and such new evidence taken as may be produced.</p>

<p>71. If the former sentence be reversed, the costs which shall have been
kept in deposit shall be refunded to the appellant, and levied from the other
party.</p>

<p>72. And in confirming it, an enhancement of these costs is left to the
discretion of the court; provided, however, the whole never exceed fifteen
per cent. on the sum originally sued for.</p>

<p>73. A second appeal to any other authority shall, in no instance, be permitted.</p>

<p>74. The <em>Bopáti's</em> court shall be competent to receive complaints in civil
cases, where the amount at issue is not less than twenty, nor exceeds fifty,
rupees.</p>

<p>75. This complaint being filed, a copy of it shall be sent to the person
complained of, with an order to answer it at most within a week; and, on
receipt of this answer, notice shall be given on what day (at farthest a
week from the time of the receipt) the cause will be tried. Such witnesses
as are necessary will be summoned; and, on the day prescribed, the complaint
and answer being read, and evidence being taken, the court shall
give its decision.</p>

<p>76. In failure of the complainant's appearance, the cause shall be dismissed;
and on the part of the defendant, if he give not in his answer as
required, or appear not when summoned, the case shall be proceeded with,
and sentence given on <em>ex parte</em> evidence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxv" id="Page_mmlxv">[Vol II Pg lxv]</a></span></p>

<p>77. The <em>Bopáti</em>, or his deputy, shall require the <em>Jáksa</em> and <em>Panghulu</em> to
assist him with their advice throughout the trial, and to expound the law
where it is not sufficiently clear. Should their opinions concur with that
of the president of the court, he shall pass his decision, and carry it into
execution without further delay; but when their opinions are at variance
with his, he shall, previously to pronouncing sentence, refer the case, with
the several reasons detailed which have influenced each opinion, to the
Resident, who shall consult with the chief <em>Jáksa</em> and <em>Panghulu</em> of the residency,
and return his orders on the subject.</p>

<p>78. A fee of one rupee shall be taken from each party, on giving in the
complaint and answer; and ten per cent. on the amount of the sentence
shall be levied from the loser of the suit. The fees to be divided among
the officers of the court, and the costs to be carried to the account of
government.</p>

<p>79. All proceedings are to be carefully noted down, and preserved as
records. One copy to be kept in the archives of the <em>Bopáti</em>, and another
to be forwarded to the Resident.</p>

<p>80. An appeal, in causes originating in this court, shall lie to that of the
Resident; provided notice of the appeal being intended to be made, be given
in on the day of trial, and the appeal itself be made within a week after.</p>

<p>81. In this case the costs shall, nevertheless, be immediately levied, and
held in deposit till the appeal be decided on. Sufficient security shall also
be given for the amount of the sentence.</p>

<p>82. Moreover, on the first institution of all civil cases, in this and every
other court, good security must be taken for the amount of possible costs,
both from the complainant and person complained of.</p>

<p>83. The <em>Bopáti</em> will be held responsible for the faithful and just discharge
of these his high duties. To him does government look, not only
for the vigilant administration of police, and impartial distribution of justice
throughout his district, but for the zealous execution of every measure
that can at all conduce to the preserving that district in a flourishing
and happy state.</p>

<p>84. The duties attached to the office of Resident itself are fully explained
in the general instructions given to that officer on his first entering into
his situation. In this regulation only such parts of the charge committed
to him will be dwelled on, as belong properly to the judicial department of
his service, to his deliberative and executive powers as chief judge and
magistrate of the province.</p>

<p>85. As, however, the due exertion of these powers may require a much
larger portion of time than can be possibly devoted to them by a single
individual, and more particularly, as much of his attention must be
directed to other objects, he is empowered to delegate their full participation
to his deputy or assistant, whether in presiding in his court, or in
issuing and receiving such orders and instructions as the government of
his residency may render necessary.</p>

<p>86. The several Residents, and their deputies or assistants, previously to
entering upon the execution of the duties of their office, shall take and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxvi" id="Page_mmlxvi">[Vol II Pg lxvi]</a></span>
subscribe the following oath before the Honourable the Lieutenant-governor
in Council, or such person as he may appoint to administer the same.</p>

<p>"I,​&mdash;​&mdash;, solemnly swear that I will truly and faithfully execute
the duties of my office; that I will administer justice to the best of my
ability, knowledge, and judgment, without fear, favour, promise, or hope
of reward; and that I will not receive, directly or indirectly, any present,
either in money or in effects of any kind, from any party in any
suit or prosecution, or from any person whomsoever, on account of any
suit, prosecution, or other legal proceeding to be instituted, or which
may be depending, or have been decided, in any court under my jurisdiction;
nor will I, directly or indirectly, derive any profits from my
station, except such as the orders of government do or may authorize me
to receive.​&mdash;So help me God."</p>

<p>87. The presidents of other subordinate courts shall take and subscribe
before the Resident, oaths of a similar nature and form, to be administered
by the priests, according to the custom of the country.</p>

<p>88. The <em>Jáksas</em> and <em>Panghulus</em> shall likewise be required to take and
subscribe an oath in the following form:</p>

<p>"I, ​&mdash;​&mdash;, <em>Jáksa</em> (or <em>Panghulu</em>), do solemnly swear, that I will faithfully
execute the office entrusted to me; I will answer truly to the questions
put to me in writing, or by word of mouth, by any judge of the
courts to which I belong, declaring or writing down freely, without fear
or partiality, what is the written acknowledged law or local long established
usage; and I will declare or give in writing nothing that is not
warranted by the law or custom. And I promise and swear not to accept
of any consideration, in money or otherwise, for any opinion or
declaration of the law or custom I may deliver, as <em>Jáksa</em> (or <em>Panghulu</em>)
of any court."</p>

<p>89. In the sixth clause of the Proclamation by government, dated 21st
January, 1812, provision was made for the establishment of a Landrost's
court; but, in the present state of circumstances, government deeming it
advisable that a considerable extension of the powers vested in that court
should be given, for the more prompt and effectual administration of justice,
it is ordered, that the following sections be considered as an enlargement
and modification of that clause, and that in lieu of the landraad therein
appointed, there be constituted a court, to be in future called the Resident's.</p>

<p>90. This court shall be composed in the following manner. The Resident
or his assistant shall sit in it as sole judge or magistrate. The
<em>Bopátis</em> of the several districts, or their deputies, shall attend to assist the
Resident, through every stage of the proceedings, with their advice, or
with such information as he may require. The head <em>Jáksa</em> and <em>Panghulu</em>
shall be in waiting to expound, where necessary, the law, to state the local
usage, and to take down notes of the evidence. The <em>Jáksa</em> of that
district in which any crime has been committed, shall be the public prosecutor,
where no private one appears. The other native officers shall be
such as have been used heretofore to compose courts of this nature.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxvii" id="Page_mmlxvii">[Vol II Pg lxvii]</a></span></p>

<p>91. This court shall be held at least twice in every week, or oftener if
necessary, in the <em>Passerban</em>, or Residency public court-room, for the purpose
of hearing complaints of every description that may be brought before
it, of examining into all offences reported to have been committed,
and trying all causes, whether civil or criminal, that occur in the Residency;
with the exception only of those that will, in a subsequent section,
be pointed out, as belonging to another and higher authority, the Court of
Circuit.</p>

<p>92. The court shall be held open from the hour of ten in the fore to that
of three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>93. For greater precision, the court days may be fixed to the Monday
and Thursday of every week. It is, however, left to the Resident to alter
these days of sitting, whenever he may deem that there is sufficient reason
for so doing, observing, in such cases, to give public notice of the intended
change at least one court day preceding it.</p>

<p>94. The chief <em>Jáksa</em>, who will have the custody of all persons apprehended
and brought into the town until regularly committed to gaol, shall immediately,
on opening the court, present to the Resident a list of such
prisoners as have been confided to his care since the last court day, stating
from whence they came, what the nature of the offence alleged against
them, the names of the witnesses brought to prove it, and other necessary
information connected with their apprehension.</p>

<p>95. The Resident shall then commence on the investigation of the cases,
ordering in each that the report of the officer of division, and original complaint,
be first read, and proceeding afterwards to the examination of the
witnesses.</p>

<p>96. Should it appear to the Resident that there is not sufficient evidence
against the accused, and should the complainant not be able to adduce any
further, the prisoner shall be immediately released out of custody.</p>

<p>97. But should the complainant state that he can produce more witnesses,
he shall be required to enter into a penalty-bond for their appearance
on a given day (that day to be as little distant as possible, nor, if
practicable, to exceed a week from the time of this first examination), and
the prisoner shall, in this case, be admitted to bail, provided the offence be
of a bailable nature.</p>

<p>98. If the offence charged against him be one that does not admit of
bail being taken, the Resident shall sign a warrant to the gaoler, to receive
and hold him in safe custody until he shall be discharged by due course of
law.</p>

<p>99. On the second examination, should the innocence of the prisoner
appear sufficiently clear, he shall be forthwith released; but should, on
either the first or second day of inquiry, such presumption of guilt be
established, as to render necessary a regular trial, the prisoner shall stand
fully committed for it, and be remanded to gaol, there to remain until that
day of trial arrive.</p>

<p>100. If the crime imputed to him be murder, treason, gang-robbery, or
any other for which the sentence may amount to death, the Resident shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxviii" id="Page_mmlxviii">[Vol II Pg lxviii]</a></span>
not himself proceed further in the case, but commit him to prison, to take
his trial before the Court of Circuit, of which more shall be said hereafter.</p>

<p>101. Should the offence with which he is charged be one of any less
magnitude than capital, the Resident shall, in ordering him to jail, notify
to the prisoner on what day his trial shall come on before himself. That
day must not, without some good and sufficient reason, to be reported to
government, exceed the distance of a week from the day of his commitment
to prison.</p>

<p>102. On the day of trial, the prisoner being brought up, the former proceedings
shall be read, and the witnesses again examined, and such further
evidence, on the part of the prosecution, be taken as may be necessary.
The prisoner shall then be called on for his defence, and the witnesses
adduced by him be heard and examined.</p>

<p>103. The Resident shall finally sum up the evidence, and stating the
reasons that have influenced his opinion, and the law of the case, pronounce
sentence accordingly.</p>

<p>104. In these, and all other cases, whether civil or criminal, which come,
before him, the Resident shall be guided in his decisions by the existing
native laws, and ancient customs of the island; provided the same be not
decidedly at variance with the universal and acknowledged principles of
natural justice.</p>

<p>105. In every instance where the opinions of the <em>Panghulu</em> and <em>Jáksa</em>
are in accord with the judgment of the Resident, and in which the punishment
fixed to the crime does not amount to imprisonment or transportation
for life, the sentence of the Resident shall be final, and be immediately
carried into execution.</p>

<p>106. But whenever the opinions of the <em>Panghulu</em> and <em>Jáksa</em> shall be in
opposition to that of the Resident, or in which the punishment of the
crime shall amount to imprisonment or transportation for life, all the proceedings
shall be immediately transmitted to government, with the Resident's
statement of the reasons and regulations on which he has formed
his opinion; but he shall delay the pronouncing sentence, until the approval
of the Honourable the Lieutenant-Governor shall have been obtained.</p>

<p>107. In all cases whatever of trial before this court, the Resident shall
transmit to government, in English, a statement of the offence charged
against the prisoner, the substance of the evidence on the prosecution and
defence, the law of the case as it exists in the regulations of government,
or in the written or customary laws of the island, and the particular reason
on which he has formed his own opinion. The <em>Jáksa</em> and <em>Panghulu</em>
are required to take notes of the evidence, and to state their respective
opinions on the case in the vernacular language; which document,
signed by them, shall be transmitted to government by the Resident, together
with his own statement of the case.</p>

<p>108. The civil jurisdiction of this court shall be constituted as follows:</p>

<p>109. It shall be competent to receive original complaints of every de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxix" id="Page_mmlxix">[Vol II Pg lxix]</a></span>scription,
and to try such appeals as may be made to it from the decisions
of the <em>Bopáti's</em> court.</p>

<p>110. On receipt of this complaint, if the amount at issue exceed not
twenty rupees, the Resident, at his pleasure, may refer it to be inquired
into and tried by the court of the officer of the division in which the
matter complained of occurred; or should the amount be not above fifty
rupees, he may make it over to the authority of the <em>Bopáti's</em> court of that
district in which the subject at issue has originated. But all complaints
which concern a sum of money exceeding this, must be tried only by the
Resident's court.</p>

<p>111. It is also competent to this court alone to take cognizance of any
suits, however trivial the amount at issue, which may be considered as
involving in them any of the rights of government.</p>

<p>112. In trying appeals from the <em>Bopáti's</em> courts, after reading the proceedings
on the former trial, and re-examining such old, or hearing such
new evidence as may be adduced, the judgment which shall then be passed
shall be considered as final.</p>

<p>113. In reversing the former decree, the appellant shall have refunded
to him the costs which have been kept in deposit, and these shall be then
levied from the other party; but if confirming the former judgment, it
shall be left to the discretion of the Resident to enhance those costs as he
may think fit; provided, however, that the whole sum do not exceed
fifteen per cent. on the amount of the sentence.</p>

<p>114. The appellant, on the institution of the suit, shall pay such fees as
are customary in the institution of original suits; but the other party
shall not be charged with any fees whatever.</p>

<p>115. When an original complaint is given in, it shall be filed, on a fee
of one rupee being paid, and sufficient security given for the possible
amount of costs.</p>

<p>116. A copy of this shall then be sent to the person or persons complained
of, who shall be required, within a certain given time, not to exceed
a fortnight, to send in the answer; at which time they will also pay
a fee of one rupee, and give good security for the amount of possible costs.</p>

<p>117. On receipt of this reply, a day shall be appointed for the trial of
the cause, notice of which shall be given to each of the parties; and both
they and such others, witnesses or accessaries, as may be necessary, shall
be summoned to attend on that day. The cause shall then come to a
regular hearing, and be decided on, according to the mode already laid
down for the inferior courts.</p>

<p>118. On the decision of the suit, a fee of two rupees from the gainer,
and of one from the loser of it, shall be received; and costs, at the rate
of ten per cent. on the amount of the sentence, being the custom of the
country, shall be levied from the party against whom the decision has
been given.</p>

<p>119. In all causes originating in the Resident's court, an appeal shall be
permitted to the Honourable the Lieutenant-Governor; provided that
notice of such intention be given on the day of trial, that the costs be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxx" id="Page_mmlxx">[Vol II Pg lxx]</a></span>
lodged in court, and sufficient security offered for the amount of the sentence,
or that amount be paid in, to be kept in deposit until the appeal
shall have been determined on.</p>

<p>120. Appeals from the Resident's decisions are limited to the space of
one month from the day of trial.</p>

<p>121. The Honourable the Lieutenant-governor will, of course, after
due investigation, alter, reverse, or confirm the former sentence, with remission
or enhancement of costs, as to him shall seem best.</p>

<p>122. Whenever the two parties in a civil suit, in any stage of it previous
to the decree, shall give in to any of the courts an agreement signed by
both, stating that they are willing that all further judicial proceedings in
the case be dropped, as being satisfied with what has already passed, or
mutually content to settle whatever further is requisite between themselves,
or by the arbitration of friends, the court shall place this paper among
their records, and cause the proceedings in such suit to be immediately
closed.</p>

<p>123. In these cases, half costs, or five per cent, only on the amount of
the suit, shall be levied. Of this the two parties shall pay an equal share,
or two and a half per cent each, with a fee also of a rupee each to the
court.</p>

<p>124. All fees will be divided among the officers of the court, and all
costs be carried to the account of government, for the purpose of defraying
the expenses to which they are put in the establishment of these courts.</p>

<p>125. The same attention shall be paid to the opinions of the <em>Jáksa</em> and
<em>Panghulu</em> in civil as in criminal cases; namely, that when at variance with
that of the Resident, reference shall be made to the Honourable the Lieutenant-Governor,
accompanied by the detailed statements, and the decision
only carried into execution when his instructions, in reply, shall have been
received.</p>

<p>126. A record of each trial shall be kept in the archives of the court,
consisting of the original complaint, the reply to it, a statement of the
proceedings that ensued, and the judge's final decision.</p>

<p>127. Copies of any of these shall be given to any one who may apply for
them, on the payment of half a rupee for each paper.</p>

<p>128. Registers shall be framed from these records, one in English and
one in the vernacular language (of course separate ones for civil and criminal
matters), stating the charges, names of parties, of witnesses, nature
of evidence, sentence passed, &amp;c. according to forms to be furnished to the
Resident; and of these, one copy shall be kept in the court, and another
shall be transmitted, before the 5th of every month, to the Honourable the
Lieutenant-governor.</p>

<p>129. A register shall also be framed, and sent at the same time, of all
persons apprehended, but afterwards released, stating their names, crimes
imputed to them, nature of evidence for and against, and reasons for releasing
them.</p>

<p>130. Quarterly reports shall likewise be furnished by the Resident of
the general state of the districts entrusted to his care; and every six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxi" id="Page_mmlxxi">[Vol II Pg lxxi]</a></span>
months abstract accounts must be forwarded of the increase or decrease of
population, the general condition of the cultivation, number of new settlers
and persons emigrated, and generally of whatever relates to the details of
his administration, with such remarks and comments as he may deem
necessary.</p>

<p>131. In summoning persons to attend his court, he shall have a certain
regard to the loss or inconvenience those persons may sustain in being
taken away from their usual employments or duties. The cultivator of
the soil, in particular, is not unnecessarily to be brought from his fields;
and, in many cases, a slight delay of trial may be better than causing the
industrious inhabitant to lose the fruits of his labour by attendance at
court, when harvest, or other rural duty, demands his presence and entire
attention. This, however, is an evil that cannot always be guarded
against; but it ought to be so, to the extent of the Resident's power, and
as far as the satisfying the more important ends of justice will admit of.</p>

<p>132. As an additional check to its occurrence, a discretionary power is
vested in the Resident, of punishing by fine the complainant in such
suits as may, in the opinion of the Resident, be satisfactorily established
to have owed its origin to grounds merely vexatious, and this fine will of
course be given to the person who has suffered by the process.</p>

<p>133. As it is most essential that access to justice and redress be rendered
as easy and free as possible to the injured, the Residents are ordered
to receive at all times, and to pay the utmost attention, to every petition
that may be presented to them.</p>

<p>134. But as, in the ordinary course, the officers or servants of government,
or others, may, from interested, partial, or resentful motives, find
means to debar approach to the Resident in his house, he shall cause a box
to be placed at the door of the court, into which petitions may be dropped;
of this he shall himself keep the key, and, on going into court, open it
with his own hand, and have the contents read to him. He shall, at the
same time, in the open space before the court, invite the giving in to him
any complaints from persons who may consider themselves as aggrieved.</p>

<p>135. It must be observed, that in all causes which come into the courts,
the respective parties in them shall plead in their own behalf. It not
having been heretofore usual to employ <em>Vakeels</em>, or native lawyers, for this
purpose; no persons of this description shall be admitted. And it is
trusted that litigation will be considerably reduced and discouraged by this
measure, as the trouble of it will then fall heavily and entirely on the
principals themselves; that class of people not being allowed to exist, who,
as deriving from litigation their sole subsistence, may fairly, and without
invidiousness, be considered as having some interest in increasing the
business of the courts.</p>

<p>136. The Resident is particularly enjoined to pay the greatest attention
to the state of the persons in confinement by his orders.</p>

<p>137. There shall be one gaol only in each Residency, and that at the
place where the Resident himself resides. He shall visit it at least once a
fortnight, and redress all complaints that may be preferred to him by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxii" id="Page_mmlxxii">[Vol II Pg lxxii]</a></span>
prisoners of ill treatment, punishing amply every instance that shall come
to his knowledge, of misconduct in the gaoler or other officers in charge
of the prison.</p>

<p>138. He shall take, too, the necessary measures for the preservation of
the health and cleanliness of the prisoners; requiring the Surgeon of the
Residency to visit them at least once a day, and to administer to the sick.
The Surgeon shall be further directed to deliver in a monthly report to
the Resident on this subject, stating the number of sick, nature of disease,
cause of it where assignable, and result of his medical operations in the
several cases. To this may be added any suggestions that may be deemed
beneficial.</p>

<p>139. The internal arrangements of the gaol ought to be so ordered,
that the prisoners shall not be confined together promiscuously, but different
apartments be allotted, not only for persons of different sexes, but
also for those in confinement for different gradations of offence. For the
following descriptions of prisoners, separate wards ought to be formed.
Prisoners under sentence of death. Prisoners confined under sentence of
the Court of Circuit or of the Resident. Prisoners committed to take
their trial before the Court of Circuit. Prisoners committed to take their
trial before the Resident. And one spacious and airy apartment should be
reserved for such persons as are awaiting the preliminary examination in
the court.</p>

<p>140. All prisoners or witnesses detained in criminal cases shall be maintained
at the expense of government. But the subsistence of persons confined
on civil accounts shall be furnished in the usual manner by the complainants
in those suits.</p>

<p>141. The rate of maintenance must depend on the general price of food
in the district where the confinement takes place. It ought to be sufficiently
ample to secure the necessaries of life, but by no means any thing
further; it ought not, in short, to be higher than the price for which the
lowest description of labour could be obtained. On this principle the
Residents will regulate the allowance for prisoners, and when settled and
approved of by government, it shall be considered as fixed, and be publicly
made known.</p>

<p>142. The Residents finally shall see that the prisoners receive all the
comforts compatible with their respective situations, and that the allowance
granted by government, or others, for their support, be properly
applied.</p>

<p>143. With respect to the authority of the Resident's Court over Europeans,
Chinese, or other foreigners, though it has not heretofore been
ordered that they be amenable to any but the courts of justice in Batavia,
<em>Semárang</em>, and <em>Surabáya</em>; yet as great inconvenience may be, and has
been experienced, from their being under a separate jurisdiction from their
fellow-inhabitants, and as it is the wish of government that they be allowed
to partake of every benefit afforded to its other subjects, of which a prompt
and easy access to justice must be considered as the chief, the following
orders are issued respecting them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxiii" id="Page_mmlxxiii">[Vol II Pg lxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>144. No Europeans, Chinese, or other foreigners, at present settled, or
who, in future, may wish to settle in the interior, shall be allowed to reside
in any part of the country without the immediate limits of the towns of
Batavia, <em>Semárang</em>, and <em>Surabáya</em>, unless they present themselves to the
Resident, to be regularly enrolled in a register to be kept for that purpose,
and obtain from him a license for remaining. This license shall not be
granted, unless each individual enter into a penalty-bond of five hundred
rupees, that he will abide by the civil decisions of the Resident's Court to
that amount; but if this be agreed to, the license shall on no account be
withheld, unless the Resident can, and does, give such reasons for withholding
it as the government shall approve of. No fee whatsoever shall
be given for these licenses.</p>

<p>145. Should it, at any time, happen that a cause, in which more than
five hundred rupees is at issue, should come before the Resident, wherein
a foreigner living in the interior is concerned, the Resident shall call on
him to execute a further bond, which may cover the amount of the suit;
and in case of refusal to do so, he shall not be permitted any longer to
reside within his jurisdiction.</p>

<p>146. After taking out these licenses, foreigners shall, in every respect,
be considered in the same light as other inhabitants, and sue and be sued
precisely in the same manner as the natives.</p>

<p>147. Should any foreigner, after these precautions, refuse to abide by
the decision of the Resident, a report on his conduct shall be forwarded to
government, and he shall instantly be made to leave the interior, and be
prosecuted for the amount of the penalty he has incurred, in the established
manner, in the courts of justice at Batavia, <em>Semárang</em>, and <em>Surabáya</em>.</p>

<p>148. In criminal cases, where a foreigner is charged with any offence,
the Resident shall execute the duties of a justice of the peace, issuing a
warrant for his apprehension, examining into the evidence adduced, and,
according to circumstances, releasing him forthwith, or committing him
to take his trial before the Court of Circuit.</p>

<p>149. It must be understood, that the term here of "foreigners" is intended
only to include Europeans, Chinese, Arabs, Mussulmen from the
various parts of India, or, in short, the natives of any country that is
without the limits of the Malayan Archipelago. But as there will resort
to the coasts of Java, in small trading vessels, very many of the inhabitants
of the neighbouring islands, to whom the entering into bonds, or
being subject to other such legal forms, would prove a serious inconvenience,
serving perhaps eventually to discourage them considerably from
engaging in such commercial adventures, which it is rather the wish of
this government in every way to promote; and as by the religion, laws,
and usages of this and the various islands in the vicinity, being, both in
form and substance, nearly identified (differing only in some few instances
in shades slight and of little moment), it cannot be considered as repugnant
to the principles of justice, that they be at once held amenable to
the jurisdiction established for this island, during their continuance on it;
and it is therefore ordered, that they be looked on and proceeded with in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxiv" id="Page_mmlxxiv">[Vol II Pg lxxiv]</a></span>
manner no way differing from that prescribed for the actual natives of
Java.</p>

<p>150. In the event of the death of any British inhabitant or passenger
within his district, it is the duty of the Resident to place the seals of office
immediately on the effects of the deceased, after defraying the expense of
interment; and to report the same immediately for the further orders of
government; and, in the event of the death of Burghers, Chinese, Mussulmen,
or others, he will be guided by the laws and regulations existing
on that head. In all cases, he will be careful that no injustice be practised
in this important subject, and that where arrears are due to government,
no property be transferred or sold until the same have been satisfied, or
until the pleasure of government is known.</p>

<p>151. The Court of Circuit has already been established by the fifth
clause of the Proclamation by government, dated the 21st January, 1812.
But as the taking away at once the president and one member from the
courts of justice rendered those courts, in their absence, incompetent to
carry on the current business of their districts, and as a more particular
definition of the duties attached to this department is deemed necessary,
the following sections must be considered as an enlargement and modification
of that clause.</p>

<p>152. In order to ensure the regular, certain, and impartial administration
of justice throughout the different districts of the island, one member
of the Supreme Court of justice at Batavia, and of the courts of justice at
<em>Semárang</em> and <em>Surabáya</em>, shall four times in the year, at stated periods, or
oftener if necessary, make a circuit through the districts, under the jurisdiction
of their respective courts, for the purpose of hearing and trying
all such offences and criminal cases within the same, as shall have been
made over to them by the magistrates appointed for that purpose.</p>

<p>153. Previously to entering upon the execution of the duties of his
office, each of these judges shall take and subscribe, before the Honourable
the Lieutenant-governor in Council, or any person appointed by him
to administer the same, an oath in the same form as already laid down for
the Residents in section 86 of this Regulation.</p>

<p>154. Upon the arrival of the judge of circuit, the Resident or magistrate
shall have in readiness to deliver to him a list of the persons committed
to prison, or held to bail, for trial, together with the copies of the
charges preferred against each, their confessions, if any have been made
(but these, it must be observed, must always be received with circumspection
and tenderness), or if they have pleaded not guilty, the depositions
of the witnesses, and all other proceedings held by him in the respective
cases, previously to their commitment to prison, or being held to bail.</p>

<p>155. He shall likewise submit to the judge of circuit, on his arrival at
the station, a separate list of all such persons as he may, within the last
three months, have apprehended and discharged for want of sufficient evidence
against them; that is, of all such as would, had presumption of
guilt been sufficiently established, have been made over to the court of
circuit for trial.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxv" id="Page_mmlxxv">[Vol II Pg lxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>156. The judge of circuit shall then proceed to hold his court. Such
officers shall belong to it as he may have brought with him for that purpose,
and he shall be attended by all such others belonging to the Resident's
establishment, as he may deem necessary.</p>

<p>157. The court shall be held in the <em>Paserban</em>, or usual chief room of
justice belonging to the station; and the Resident, in carrying on any
judicial or magisterial proceedings, during the continuance of the judge of
circuit at his station, shall use for that purpose some other convenient
place.</p>

<p>158. On opening the court the head <em>Jáksa</em> shall present a list of persons
summoned to act as jurymen; out of which five shall be taken in the
usual manner, and be empanelled.</p>

<p>159. The persons composing this jury ought to be as near on an equality
as to rank in life with the prisoner as possible. But no one under the
rank of a head of a village shall be competent to act as a juryman, as
persons below that office, or in the very lower orders of life, cannot be
supposed to possess either independence or knowledge sufficient to qualify
them to execute justly the duties of the situation. The person senior in
dignity among them shall be appointed to act as foreman; and, for this
purpose, it may be as well that one of higher rank than the other four
should be always selected in the first nomination of the jury.</p>

<p>160. A right of challenge shall belong, as in the English courts, to both
the prosecutor and the prisoner.</p>

<p>161. The head of the village in which the offence is alleged to have been
committed, shall not be permitted to act as juryman in the trial.</p>

<p>162. No other prescribed disqualification exists against persons of that
or higher rank; the right of challenge being deemed sufficient to secure
the forming of a competent, unbiassed, and independent jury.</p>

<p>163. The cause shall then be proceeded with; and sentence being passed,
it shall become the duty of the Resident to see that it be carried duly into
execution, a warrant for that purpose being given to him, under the seal
and signature of the judge of circuit.</p>

<p>164. The circuit judge, throughout the conduct of the cause, in his
mode of proceeding, of summing up the evidence, receiving the verdict of
the jury, and passing sentence on the prisoner, shall be guided entirely by
the established rules of his court, the regulations of government, and the
general instructions he will receive.</p>

<p>165. And with respect to the law which must guide him throughout, he
must, in the first instance, take down the native law in the case as may be
expounded by the <em>Panghúlu</em> and <em>Jáksa</em>; and modify thereon his decision,
according to the provisions of the colonial law, and the acknowledged
principles of substantial justice.</p>

<p>166. He shall not only try such cases as may have been made over to
his court, previously to entering the district, but also any such as the Resident
may make over to him while there.</p>

<p>167. He shall, on closing his court at each station, forward to the Honourable
the Lieutenant-governor, a clear and full report of all his proceed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxvi" id="Page_mmlxxvi">[Vol II Pg lxxvi]</a></span>ings,
stating the names of the prisoners tried by him, the nature of the
evidence adduced on behalf of both prosecution and defence, the verdict
of the jury, and his consequent sentence thereon.</p>

<p>168. If, in any case, his opinion differ from that of the jury, he shall
detail the reasons which have influenced him in that difference; and he
shall always state any such circumstances as may warrant a mitigation, or
even total remission of the punishment.</p>

<p>169. The approval of these proceedings, and the instructions on them
from the Honourable the Lieutenant-governor, must be received prior to
his issuing his warrants to the Resident.</p>

<p>170. But as this communication, and the reply to it, may induce too
great a delay, the judge of circuit must, on shutting his court, remand
the prisoner to gaol, and move on himself to the next district he has to
visit; from whence he will be able to send back the warrants to the Resident,
when an answer to his report shall have been received.</p>

<p>171. Accompanying this report, the judge of circuit shall forward to
government a detailed opinion on the state of the Residency, with respect
to its police, its general administration, and other circumstances connected
with its actual condition; suggesting, at the same time, any such improvement
as, in his opinion, would be conducive to its general prosperity.</p>

<p>172. It remains, finally, to be observed to the Residents, that as the
police of different districts must be, in some measure, adapted to various
circumstances and localities, they are authorized to enlarge upon these
general regulations for the administration of that department within their
respective jurisdictions, reporting their suggestions of improvement to
government. But it is recommended to those officers to become well
acquainted with the ancient usages and institutions of the people placed
under their authority; and in submitting their observations, they will be
solicitous rather to improve upon the solid foundations of ancient regulations
and customs, both acknowledged and understood by the people, than
to invent new systems of administration, which for some time must, of
necessity, be quite unintelligible to the inhabitants, and which, after the
experience of a few years, may probably be found to be by no means congenial
to their genius or habits.</p>

<p>173. Copies of this Regulation shall be forwarded to the various officers
of government concerned in the carrying it into execution; and translations
of it, in the Javan and Malayan languages, shall be furnished to the
<em>Bopátis</em> and other native officers. It shall be the duty of these to explain
and cause to be made known its purport throughout the country; and
for the doing this the more effectually, copies shall always lie on the tables
of the several courts, to be open for public reference and inspection.

<h2>APPENDIX F.<br />

ACCOUNT OF CELEBES.</h2>


<p>Celebes is an island of which hitherto the public has had but very scanty
accounts. The part of it best known to Europeans is <em>Makásar</em>, situated
nearly at the southernmost extremity of the western side: it was here the
first European settlement on the island was established. On the south
part of Celebes there are not any ascertained volcanos, but some are said
to exist in the northern division. Some of the mountains are very high.
The Bontain mountain, called by the natives <em>Lámpo Bátan</em> (big belly), is
the highest on the south part of the island, and being seen at the distance
of one hundred and twenty miles, must be about eight thousand five hundred
feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>The largest river on the southern limb is that called <em>Chinrána</em>, which
formerly constituted the boundary between the kingdoms of <em>Bóni</em> and
<em>Lúwu</em>. It rises on the north side of the Bontain mountain, and runs
northward as far as <em>Mario</em>, whence, inclining towards the north-east, it
passes through part of <em>Sóping</em>, and then, turning to the east, enters <em>Wáju</em>,
after having received a navigable stream from the <em>Laut-Sála</em>, or Fresh-water
Lake. After passing through <em>Wáju</em> it follows a south-east course,
and falls into the bay of <em>Bóni</em>, a few miles below the town of <em>Chinrána</em>.
This river is navigable for boats as far as <em>Mário</em>, and admits of the passage
of <em>práhus</em> of five or six <em>kóyans</em> as far as the fresh-water lake. Along the
whole of the coast, at no great distance from each other, smaller streams
fall into the sea, some of them being so considerable as to admit of a
navigation of five or six miles, and many of them at their mouths affording
shelter to trading <em>práhus</em>. Among the most considerable are <em>Baróbo</em>, <em>Linjé</em>,
and <em>Kájang</em>, to the east; <em>Duniáng</em>, <em>Lémbang</em>, <em>Halikóngkong</em>, <em>Pónre</em>, and
<em>Jenepónto</em>, on the south; and <em>Chikoang</em>, <em>Tape Jára</em>, <em>Sándra bóni</em>, <em>Gúa</em>,
<em>Télu</em>, <em>Mā́ros</em>, <em>Benáng'a</em>, <em>Langkára</em>, and <em>Pontiána</em>, on the west.</p>

<p>It has not been ascertained by whom, or at what particular time, the
name of Celebes was conferred on this island. It is generally attributed to
the Portuguese, and certainly is of foreign origin: none of the natives,
except those who have intercourse with Europeans, recognize either the
whole island or any part of it under this appellation; even among those
who make use of the word, it is applied to <em>Sumbáwa</em>, an island about two
hundred and fifty miles to the south-west of it, as well as to what we call
Celebes.</p>

<p>In the south-western limb of the island there are two principal languages,
called by Europeans the <em>Makásar</em> and <em>Búgis</em>, and by the natives
<em>Mengkása</em> or <em>Mengkasára</em>, and <em>Wági</em> or <em>Ugi</em>. The former, or some dialect
of it, is spoken in all the districts extending from <em>Bálu kúmba</em> to <em>Segére</em>.
The petty states included in this compass are <em>Bálu kúmba</em>, <em>Bontain</em>, <em>Tara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxxvi" id="Page_mmlxxxvi">[Vol II Pg lxxxvi]</a></span>báya</em>,
<em>Gúa</em>, <em>Máros</em>, and <em>Segére</em>. The <em>Búgis</em> is much more general beyond
and over the whole tract extending from <em>Bóni</em> to <em>Lúwu</em>, comprehending
the four great states of <em>Lúwu</em>, <em>Bóni</em>, <em>Wáju</em>, and <em>Sóping</em>, besides their
numerous dependencies.</p>

<p>In <em>Mándhar</em> and its vicinity is spoken the <em>Mándhar</em> language. The
centre and body of the island to the northward is distinguished by being
inhabited by the <em>Turájas</em> or <em>Harafúras</em>, who speak a more simple dialect,
and are considered the aborigines of the island; and on the north-east
corner of the island at <em>Manádu</em> and <em>Gúnung télu</em>, the inhabitants are distinguished
by some peculiarities.</p>

<p>The following observations must be understood as principally referring
to the south-western limb, the part of the island which fell under the influence
of <em>Makásar</em>.</p>

<p>It is impossible to ascertain, with any degree of precision, either the
origin of the inhabitants or their present numbers. From the most correct
accounts that could be obtained, it would appear that the southern
limb contains a population of about half a million; but from the quantity
of land now lying waste, which bears the appearance of having been once
cultivated, from the number of decayed and half-choked water-cuts, evidently
once used for the purpose of irrigation, and the multitude of spots
where ranges of cocoa-nut trees mark out the sites of villages and cottages
no longer in existence, we may infer that the number of inhabitants has
greatly declined. At present there seem to be no serious checks to population,
except the wars and the lawless violence of the people, and what
often occasions, and always aggravates them, slavery and the slave trade.
The people seem to procure a sufficient subsistence without much exertion.
The climate is salubrious, and there is abundance of water. Marriages
are early. In the history of the island the years of famine are particularly
noticed. The women are held in more esteem than could be
expected from the state of civilization in general, and undergo none of
those severe hardships, privations, or labours, that restrict fecundity in
other parts of the world. Polygamy prevails, the number of wives being
limited only by the means of the husband to purchase or support them.
It is more difficult to procure a wife than a husband; a female slave bears
a higher price in the market than a male; and the compensation fixed for
the murder of a man is only thirty dollars, while that required for the life
of a woman is forty.</p>

<p>It cannot be known with certainty, whence the aboriginal inhabitants of
Celebes emigrated to this island. The countenances of the natives, particularly
of the women, more nearly resemble the Tartar features than any
other. There are no early or generally received traditions concerning the
time when the island was first peopled, or the adventures of the first race.
Each state, however, has its traditionary tales, most of which relate to
remote antiquity, or to a condition of society very different from that
which at present exists. In the <em>Búgis</em> states, the earliest stories refer to a
period subsequent to the <em>Galígas</em> of <em>Sawéra Gáding</em>, and in the <em>Makásar</em>
states to the <em>Rupáma</em> of <em>Ma Beséang</em>, which will be mentioned here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxxvii" id="Page_mmlxxxvii">[Vol II Pg lxxxvii]</a></span>after.
The <em>Galígas</em> contain an account of the peopling of <em>Lúwu</em> or <em>Láwat
from heaven</em>.</p>

<p>The first of the two following accounts was given by the <em>Búgis</em> ambassador;
the other is an extract.</p>

<p>"In the first place, there was a supernatural being of the female sex,
who, being married to <em>Taja Rasupa</em>, a person sprung from under the
earth, had issue a boy and a girl, who were named <em>Ladiwati</em> and <em>Chuli-puji</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Chuli-puji</em> married <em>Lasikati</em>, and by her had a son, called <em>Léptau</em>, who
had two or three other names besides, <em>viz. Matan-tika</em>, <em>Malati-saprang</em>,
and <em>Pulu Datu Pamusu</em>.</p>

<p>"<em>Pamusu's</em> place of residence was in the country of <em>Teku</em>, afterwards
known by the name of <em>Boni</em>. At this time <em>Pamusu</em> and all his children
dying, the country of the <em>Bugis</em> was left without a raja, and remained
so for about seven generations; at the end of which period a raja springing
up among the <em>Bugis</em> themselves, government was again introduced
into the country.</p>

<p>"On one occasion there came a storm of thunder and lightning, so
violent as to rend the earth and cause it to rock like a boat tossed by
the waves of the sea. On the thunder and lightning abating, and the
earth ceasing to be longer agitated, there was observed in the middle
of a plain, dressed in white, one of human shape, who was generally
supposed to be a supernatural being, and to whom many people went
up in a body, saying to it, 'remain then here and fly not about from
place to place.' To them the being replied, 'what you say is well;
but you cannot take me from your raja, as I am myself but a slave.
If, however, you are really desirous of having a raja, there is my
master at your service.' The <em>Boni</em> people then observed to the being,
'how can we make a raja of him, whom having never seen, we cannot
tell what he is like?' 'If,' answered the being, 'you do really desire
it, he shall be shewn to you.' They said, 'we do earnestly wish it,
and request thou wilt be so kind as to carry us where we may see him
of whom thou speakest.'</p>

<p>"When these people of <em>Boni</em>, together with the being who led them,
had reached the open plain called <em>Matajam</em>, there came on a violent
storm, accompanied with thunder and lightning, which rent and shook
the earth. There arose, at the same time, a thick fog, which totally
obscured every thing.</p>

<p>"As soon as the storm was over, and the earth no longer continued to
be rent and shaken by the thunder and lightning, the clearness which
immediately succeeded discovered to the view, seated on a stone, four
supernatural beings, of whom three were separately employed in holding
the umbrella, fan, and siri-box of the other, who was dressed in
yellow. The being dressed in yellow then said to him in white, 'What
would'st thou?' The being in white replied, 'I have conducted
hither those people of <em>Boni</em> whom you now see before you;' and then
said to the <em>Boni</em> people, 'Behold my master, of whom I spoke to you.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxxviii" id="Page_mmlxxxviii">[Vol II Pg lxxxviii]</a></span>
Those people went up to the supernatural being in yellow, and thus
addressed him: 'We, the slaves of your mightiness, have come to
present ourselves before you, to solicit that you will favour and oblige
us, by remaining among us as our raja, and that you will not continue
to wander about from place to place.'</p>

<p>"The being complied with the wishes of the people of <em>Boni</em> and settling
at <em>Matajam</em> had issue five children, of whom the first was a son and the
four succeeding ones daughters. One of the daughters was married to
a man of <em>Palaka</em>. The son was married to a <em>Bóni</em> woman.</p>

<p>"After being forty years in <em>Bóni</em>, the supernatural being disappeared,
and was succeeded by the son, who, in point of size and height, had not
his equal in <em>Bóni</em>, neither could any one be compared to him for strength
or valour, or for the adulation which was paid him. He was the first
who introduced the manufacture of krises, which he could model out of
pieces of iron, by means of his fingers alone."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<em>Bitara Gúru</em> was the eldest son of <em>Déwata Pitutu</em> by <em>Déwi Paléng'i</em>,
and inhabited the seventh heaven. <em>Déwata Pitutu</em> had a brother, called
<em>Gúru Réslang</em>, who held the rule of the region under the earth. <em>Déwata
Pitutu</em> had nine children in all.</p>

<p>"When <em>Bitara Gúru</em> was sent down upon earth by his father, <em>Déwata
Pitutu</em>, he was provided with the following articles, viz. <em>Telatingpéba</em>,
<em>Siri ataka</em>, <em>Telarasa</em>, <em>Wampung</em>, <em>Wanu</em>, <em>Chachu-bana</em>.</p>

<p>"From these, which were scattered about, every thing living and dead,
in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, which are to be found
in the country of <em>Lawat</em>, originated. Preparatory to this, <em>Déwata Pitutu</em>
having compounded a medicine, of which the juice of chewed betel
was an ingredient, rubbed <em>Bitara Gúru</em> all over with it, which immediately
occasioned him to swoon. <em>Déwata Pitutu</em> then put his son into
a hollow bambu, and, having rolled this up in a piece of cloth, and
caused the gates of the sky to be opened, he hurling sent down his son
to earth, amidst a tremendous storm of thunder, lightning, wind, and
rain, which arose on that occasion. Having reached about half way
between the earth and sky, <em>Bitára Gúru</em> (dreadfully alarmed at the
situation he was in) threw abroad all the articles which had been given
to him, agreeably to the instructions of his sire. After his arrival on
the earth, <em>Bitara Gúru</em> remained for three days and three nights shut
up in the bambu, without food or drink. By his exertions, however,
the bambu at last burst, when, getting out, he wandered through the
woods till he came to the side of a river, where he met with a king of
the gods dressed in yellow. One night there arose a violent storm of
thunder, lightning, wind, and rain. On its clearing up there was seen
a fine country, with a superb palace and fort, and houses, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the
most beautiful structure. In this beautiful country <em>Bitara Gúru</em> sat
himself down as sovereign, with a complete establishment, and gave it
the name of <em>Lawat</em>."</p>

<p>No account can be procured of any intercourse having subsisted be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmlxxxix" id="Page_mmlxxxix">[Vol II Pg lxxxix]</a></span>tween
this island and Western India or China, prior to the introduction of
Mahomedanism. No inscriptions or other monuments, indicating the
former prevalence of the Hindu worship over Celebes, have as yet been
found. There not having been found, however, is no proof that they do
not exist, for the wars that have lately prevailed have prevented Europeans
from exploring in search of such objects in that part of the country
where they are most likely to present themselves. The best informed
natives call themselves descendants of Hindus, and the names of their
divinities, <em>Batara Gúru</em>, <em>Baruna</em>, &amp;c. seem to indicate either a common
origin or a former intercourse. It is also remarkable, that some of the
inhabitants of <em>Lúwu</em> and the neighbouring state of <em>Bontain</em> are said to
dress in the same manner as the Hindus of Western India, and that Hindu
temples are reported to exist in some parts of this state. <em>Brahma</em> and
<em>Budha</em> have, however, never been heard of; and though <em>Déwas</em> are often
mentioned, their attributes are equally unknown.</p>

<p>The intercourse of these islanders with the natives of Java seems to
have been ancient and frequent. The earliest records of the <em>Búgis</em> and
<em>Mákasar</em> states denote not only an early communication with Java, but
render it highly probable that a colony from Java settled in the south-west
limb of Celebes. In no other way can we account for the transfer of
the names of places from the former to the latter island, such as those of
<em>Majapáhit</em>, <em>Grésik</em>, <em>Japan</em>, and some others. In the genealogy, too, of the
sovereigns of <em>Lúwu</em>, one of the first of their <em>Déwa</em> princes is said to have
been married to a princess of <em>Majapáhit</em> on Java.</p>

<p>Though some of the <em>Búgis</em> states have a good deal of trade, they principally
depend upon themselves for subsistence. The mode of husbandry
is, of course, very rude, and feudal institutions stand in the way of their
improvement; but private property in the soil is established, and lands
are held in free tenure or by rent-hold. The amount of the rent, in the
latter case, is generally one-third of the produce, paid in kind; the cultivator
is entitled to one-third, and the owner of the buffaloes or bullocks
which assist is entitled to the remaining third. Labourers employed to
reap are paid a sixth of what they collect. No class is excluded from a
proprietary right in the soil, and the proprietor can dispose of his land by
sale whenever he chooses.</p>

<p>The people of Celebes are active and enterprising traders; the character
of a merchant is held in esteem, and the sovereign princes reckon it no
disgrace to enter into commercial speculations. Unfortunately, however,
they are actuated by the narrow spirit of the trader, to the prejudice of
the liberal policy of the monarch, and make their power subservient to
their love of gain, by establishing in their own favour monopolies against
their subjects. Monopolies are common in every state on the island, but
most of them are only of a temporary nature. The sovereign of <em>Lúwu</em>
monopolizes the trade in brass; the Raja of <em>Sóping</em> that of <em>siri</em> (betel
leaf), which yields him three hundred dollars a month; and the Raja of
<em>Sedendreng</em> that of salt and opium.</p>

<p>So strong is the spirit of commercial enterprise among the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxc" id="Page_mmxc">[Vol II Pg xc]</a></span>
of this island, that they frequently borrow sums for the purchase of commodities
on which they expect profit, and stake their personal liberty, and
that of their families, on the success of an adventure. In their trading
voyages each person in the <em>práhu</em> has his own share of the cargo, and conducts
business on his own account: each person likewise carries his own
provisions; the latter practice, especially, is never departed from. The
owner of the vessel agrees to undertake the voyage with a number of
people, great or small, in proportion to its size, and apportions the vessel
among them in the following manner. The two <em>júru múdus</em>, or steersmen,
receive one <em>pétah</em> (or division) before the <em>sanketan</em>, and the whole space
abaft of it; the owner is entitled to two <em>pétahs</em> in the broadest part of the
boat; and the two <em>júru bátus</em> to the whole space between the masts; the
remaining <em>pétahs</em> are divided among the crew, from whom the owner, or
<em>nakóda</em>, receives a freight of one-tenth or one-twentieth of the price of all
the commodities they sell, according as they are bulky or small, in proportion
to their value. The <em>júru múdis</em> and <em>júru bátus</em> only pay one-half of
the proportion of freight paid by the rest of the crew. Sometimes the
owner supplies the crew with an advance of money for an adventure, and
receives at its termination not only re-payment of his loan, but a third of
the profits of the speculation.</p>

<p>The principal articles of trade are cotton, which is imported from the
surrounding islands, and re-exported after being manufactured into
cloths, known by the name of <em>Búgis</em> cloths, which are in great demand
throughout the Archipelago, and, in general, of a more delicate texture
than those manufactured in Java; birds' nests, <em>trípang</em> (sea slug), shark's
fins, tortoise-shell, <em>ágar ágar</em>, hides, and other articles calculated for the
Chinese market, are collected in considerable quantities, and furnish return
cargoes for the annual Chinese junks which visit Celebes. Gold is obtained
on Celebes, but in much smaller quantities than on Borneo or
Sumatra.</p>

<p>Although the <em>Búgis</em>, in general, are considered as great traders, the
foreign commerce seems to be almost exclusively confined to the people
of <em>Wáju</em>. These people are settled in considerable numbers in all the
trading ports, from Acheen to Manilla, and it is they who form the crew
of almost all the <em>Búgis práhus</em> that navigate the eastern seas.</p>

<p>Several <em>Búgis práhus</em> from <em>Mákasar</em> annually visit the northern coast of
New Holland and the Gulf of Carpentaria in search of <em>trípang</em>, and sometimes
a small party is left to collect the <em>trípang</em> in readiness for the arrival
of the <em>práhus</em> in the following year.</p>

<p>The <em>Búgis</em>, indeed, is the great maritime and commercial state of the
Archipelago. The cargoes of their vessels, particularly in opium, gold,
and cloths, often amount to fifty or sixty thousand dollars each, and the
people who navigate and are concerned in them are acknowledged to be
fair and honourable traders.</p>

<p>The natives of the southern limb of Celebes are of a light active form of
body, generally well made, and rather below the middle stature. They
are said to be revengeful; but during the period of the British govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxci" id="Page_mmxci">[Vol II Pg xci]</a></span>ment
at <em>Makásar</em>, few, if any, examples occurred to support such an
assertion. Certain it is, that in no single instance, was the death of
those who fell in a recent war between the two parties of the <em>Makásar</em>
nation, avenged by their relations, although the persons by whose hands
they had fallen were perfectly well known.</p>

<p>They attach themselves to their chiefs principally for their own convenience,
but, in some cases, they have evinced a devoted fidelity. They
often change their chief, but scarcely any thing can induce them to betray
the chief they have left. In no instance has the <em>práhu</em> of a Dutchman
or Chinese been carried off when navigated by <em>Makásar</em> or <em>Búgis</em>
people. Agreements once entered into are invariably observed, and a
<em>Búgis</em> is never known to swerve from his bargain. "That natural politeness
which characterises the various nations distinguished by wearing
what is termed the Malayan <em>kris</em>, is no where more forcibly exhibited
than among the inhabitants of Celebes. Their minor associations are
held together by all the attachment and warmth which distinguished
the clans of North Britain:​&mdash;the same bold spirit of independence and
enterprize distinguishes the lower orders, whilst the pride of ancestry
and the romance of chivalry are the delight of the higher classes.
Attached to the chase as an amusement, rather than as the means of
subsistence, the harvest is no sooner reaped, than each feudal lord, with
his associates and followers, devotes himself to its pursuits. The population
being equally at the command of the feudal lord, whether in time
of peace or war, agricultural pursuits, beyond a bare subsistence, are but
little attended to." On the other hand, they are throughout notorious
thieves, and scarcely consider murder as a crime. Instances of cold-blooded
barbarous murders frequently occurred within two miles of the
European fort, previously to the arrival of the British and the abolition of
the slave trade. The unfortunate people who had been kidnapped and
brought down to <em>Makásar</em> for sale, were often murdered to prevent discovery
where a ready sale was not found.</p>

<p>Many of their customs are also extremely savage. The head of an
enemy of rank is invariably severed from the dead body, and instances
have more than once occurred of the heart being cut out and eaten by
the conquerors. They are fond of the blood and raw flesh of animals.
<em>Láwar dára</em>, which is the liver and heart of a deer, cut into slices and
mixed raw with the warm blood, is esteemed their favourite dish.</p>

<p>The present form of government in all the states, except <em>Wáju</em>, appears
to be legal, fettered by a powerful aristocracy who elect the monarch: in
<em>Lúwu</em>, particularly, the sovereign possesses a title, with more pomp and
state attached to it than any other on the island, but with scarcely a
shadow of authority. In <em>Sedéndreng</em> he is the most despotic, which has
enabled him to become the richest and best armed prince in the island.
A species of feudal system prevails throughout, but it does not extend to
property in the soil. Each individual of a state considers himself the
liege subject of some petty chieftain, who is himself equally bound to a
more powerful one, and so on, by a regular chain, to the sovereigns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxcii" id="Page_mmxcii">[Vol II Pg xcii]</a></span>
<em>Góa</em>, (Makásar), <em>Bóni</em>, <em>Láwu</em>, <em>Sóping</em>, <em>Sedéndring</em>, or <em>Tanéte</em>, or to the
aristocracy of <em>Wáju</em>.</p>

<p>In each sovereignty there are two classes of nobility, called <em>Paseajáng'an</em>
and <em>Palélé</em>. <em>Paseajáng'an</em> are the barons of the state, and may be
considered in every respect as subjects, being obliged to obey all orders
they receive from the sovereign, whereas the <em>Palélé</em> are independent petty
chieftains (who have probably again under them both <em>Paseajáng'an</em> and
<em>Palélé</em>), who have attached themselves to a particular sovereign, but are
only obliged to do fixed feudal services, such as to assist with their followers
in case of war, to attend the public feasts given by the sovereign,
and to assist in building and repairing the palace of state. In <em>Sóping</em> each
<em>Palélé</em> is obliged to furnish and keep up at all times one effective soldier,
called <em>jua</em>, for the immediate protection of the sovereign.</p>

<p>When the sovereign wishes to give orders to his <em>Palélé</em>, he summons
him to his presence by a messenger who bears a <em>bila-bila</em>; the <em>bila-bila</em>
is a leaf of the <em>lóntar</em> with a number of knots on it, specifying the number
of days at the expiration of which the vassal is required to attend.
The <em>Palélé</em> receives it seated in the midst of his head people, with his right
hand on the handle of his <em>kris</em>, and as soon as he has got it rises, draws
his <em>kris</em>, and swears on it to be faithful to his sovereign. To neglect this
summons is a breach of allegiance.</p>

<p>The provinces under European authority are purely feudal; the Dutch,
as sovereign, considering themselves as sole proprietor of the soil, and the
regents, or feudal lords, being at all times liable to immediate removal and
dispossession, should they neglect to perform the feudal service required,
of whatever nature it may be.</p>

<p>The sovereign is chosen from the royal stock by a certain number of
counsellors, who also possess the right of subsequently removing him;
and such is their influence, that the sovereign can neither go to war or
adopt any public measure, except in concert with them. They have the
charge of the public treasure, and also appoint the prime minister. The
prince cannot himself take the personal command of the army; but the
usage of the country admits of a temporary resignation of office for this
purpose, in which case a regent succeeds provisionally to the rank of
chief, and carries on the affairs of government in concert with the majority
of the council. Women and minors may be elected to any office of the
state; and when this takes place, an additional officer, having a title
which literally means a support or prop, is appointed to assist.</p>

<p>In <em>Bóni</em> the prince is elected by the <em>Orang-pítu</em>, or seven hereditary
counsellors. In <em>Gúa</em> (<em>Makásar</em>) the prince is chosen by ten counsellors,
of whom the first minister, termed <em>Bechára Búta</em>, is one; this last officer
is himself appointed by the council of nine, termed the nine standards of
the country, but in the exercise of his office possesses very extraordinary
powers: it is said he can remove the sovereign himself, and call upon the
electors to make another choice. The inferior chiefs, or <em>Krains</em>, who
administer the dependent provinces, are appointed by the government,
and not elected by a council, although in the exercise of their office their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxciii" id="Page_mmxciii">[Vol II Pg xciii]</a></span>
power is in like manner limited; the number of the council varying in
different states. When the prince in council has decided upon war, the
assembled chiefs, after sprinkling their banners with blood, proceed to
take a solemn oath, by dipping their <em>krises</em> into a vessel of water, and
afterwards dancing around the blood-stained banner, with frantic gesture,
and a strange and savage contortion of the body and limbs, so as to give
the extended <em>kris</em> a tremulous motion, each severally imprecating the vengeance
of the deity against his person, if he violates his vow to exterminate
the enemy, to conquer or die.</p>

<p>The proportion of the crop which falls to the share of the landlord has
already been stated. In some districts a sixth, and in others a tenth,
belongs to the sovereign; but in general the landlord, the capitalist, and
the cultivator, may be considered to share between them the whole produce
of the land. The monopolies which the chiefs assume to themselves
have also been noticed. Besides these there are a few imposts in bazars,
which, with some other pecuniary emoluments, accrue to the chiefs, but
they are, for the most part, rather to meet their personal expenses than
to defray those of the state, and consequently hardly deserve the name of
public revenue.</p>

<p>The arms formerly used for offence by the inhabitants of Celebes were
the <em>súmpit</em>, or tube through which the poisoned dart is blown, the <em>kris</em>,
spear, <em>kléwang</em> (cutlass,) <em>bádi</em>, and <em>párany</em>: to them may now be added
muskets, musketoons, and small cannon. Those for defence were chain
armour (<em>baju ránti</em>) and two kinds of shields, the one long the other
round, made of very tough light wood, and bound together very strongly
by pieces of split rattan.</p>

<p>The Mahomedan religion is professed in all those parts of Celebes which
have any pretensions to civilization, and the <em>Koran</em>, of course, is the
standard of law and worship, as far as it is known. According to the
records of <em>Makásar</em>, the Mahomedan religion was introduced there about
the year 1603, by <em>Khateb Tungal Datu Bandang</em>, a native of <em>Menángkabau</em>
on <em>Sumátra</em>. Nearly all the inhabitants of the south-west limb are Mahomedans,
but of the centre and the other limbs of the island only a very
small portion have been converted. There are Mahomedan schools in all
parts of the south-west limb, but the Arabic language is only learnt by
those designed for the priesthood. They do not consider themselves as
belonging either to the sect of Omar or Ali, but as followers of the law of
the prophet, without regard to either. Circumcision is performed on
both sexes; on the males at ten or twelve years of age, on the females at
six or seven.</p>

<p>It has been related, that the change of religion on Celebes happened
just after the arrival of the Portuguese, who are said to have offered
Christianity at the same time that the Maláyus offered Mahomedanism.
The king of <em>Makásar</em> is said to have been doubtful which of these systems
he should adopt, till he consulted the wisest men in his dominions, who
advised him to embrace the religion of the <em>Koran</em> in preference to that of
the gospel, stating as an argument in its favour, that it had arrived first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxciv" id="Page_mmxciv">[Vol II Pg xciv]</a></span>
and that God would never permit error to arrive before truth. But this
does not appear on the records of <em>Makásar</em>.</p>

<p>The public feasts formerly held, sometimes for weeks together, appear
to have been for political rather than religious purposes: at present the
Mahomedan fasts and feasts are observed. Formerly the dead were generally
buried, but in some instances burnt. There is still to be seen in
<em>Lamúru</em> a burial-place belonging to the royal family, containing jars or
urns with the ashes of their ancestors, which are held sacred, indeed
almost worshipped, at the present day. The <em>Búgis</em> name for the places of
burial used before they were converted to Islamism is <em>Patúnan</em>, or the
place of burning. It is not known that any tribes of the <em>Turájas</em> burn
their dead at present: they are said to deposit them in excavated rocks
on the sides of hills, and to be so anxious to be buried among their relations,
that if a man of rank dies in a distant part of the country, the body
is salted to preserve it, and, in that state, carried back to his own residence.
Very little is known of these people by the inhabitants of the
south-western limb, but they are universally considered as the first inhabitants
of the island. They are a very fine race of people: the women
particularly so. It is said they will not suffer strangers or Mahomedans
to reside among them, and that the custom of procuring a certain number
of human heads previous to marriage is as prevalent among them as
with the <em>Dáyas</em> of Borneo, and the <em>Harafúras</em> of the Eastern Archipelago
in general.</p>

<p>Each state has its own system of laws, but they nearly concur in the
following principles. Each sovereign generally possesses the right of putting
to death any of his subjects, except the members of his own family.
Should any one of these commit a crime and escape into another territory,
he cannot be touched, but if taken in his own country he must be brought
before the <em>bechára</em>, who alone are capable of passing sentence on him.</p>

<p>Each petty state has its <em>bechára</em>, composed of the principal people, both
<em>Paseajáng'an</em> and <em>Palélé</em>. All disputes between its followers are decided by
it: it also judges and passes sentence in cases of theft, murder, and adultery,
and decides all causes respecting the legal right to property; but an
appeal may be made to the court or <em>bechára</em> of the principal state, the
members of which are called the <em>Kapála Bechára</em>. The decision of any
<em>bechára</em> is subject to the approval of the sovereign, where he is not himself
a party interested: indeed he may, in general, supersede the authority
of this court by deciding promptly, but it behoves him to attend
strictly to the <em>adat biása</em>, or ancient customs of the state, in his decision,
for the <em>bechára</em> has the power to remove the sovereign and elect a new
one. The same persons at all times decide on the fact and the law.</p>

<p>It is difficult to ascertain which of the dialects spoken on Celebes has
most claim to antiquity. I have already stated, that the <em>Makásar</em> and
<em>Búgis</em> are considered as the two principal languages of that part of the
island known to Europeans. The <em>Makásar</em>, the <em>Búgis</em>, and <em>Mandharese</em>,
which may be considered as dialects of the same language, use the same
character with some trifling variations. The <em>Turájas</em> or <em>Harafúras</em> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxcv" id="Page_mmxcv">[Vol II Pg xcv]</a></span>
Celebes have a fourth language, probably the most original, but it is not
known whether they are at all acquainted with writing.</p>

<p>Each nation considers its own the most ancient character. The <em>Makásar</em>
alphabet is less complete than the <em>Búgis</em>, which consists of twenty-two
letters, varied by six vocal sounds. The form of the character is
peculiar, and more nearly resembles that of the <em>Bátas</em> on Sumatra than
any other we know of. It is difficult to decide whether the <em>Búgis</em> or
<em>Makásar</em> language is the most ancient. Many words have the same
meaning in both, and many others differ so little<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> as to be evidently of
the same origin; but the <em>Búgis</em> has often six or seven synonymes, whereas
the <em>Makásar</em> has never more than two, and seldom more than one. Some
of the <em>Búgis</em> words bear strong evidence of Hindu origin, as <em>sóda</em> from
<em>sóna</em>, gold; <em>paráma</em> from <em>brahma</em>, fire; which is not at all the case with
the <em>Makásar</em>.</p>

<p><em>La Galíga</em>, the reputed son of <em>Sawíra Gáding</em>, is considered the author
of the history of <em>Sawíra Gáding</em>, which is a kind of heroic poem, and is
read in a chaunting voice, with a pause at the end of every fifth syllable.
The measure consists of a dactyl followed by a trochee, as Sāwĭră Gādĭng
to Mălămpōă, (<em>Sawíra Gáding</em> the great). He is the only author whose
name is commonly known; and all books, even the most modern, which
are written in the same manner, are called after him <em>Galíga</em>, although,
properly speaking, the term should only be applied to the history of the
heroes who are supposed to have lived previous to the seven generations
of anarchy which subsisted at <em>Bóni</em>. <em>Sultána Zaenab Zakeyat Udiu</em>, the
seventeenth sovereign of <em>Bóni</em> subsequent to the anarchy, is said to have
written an historical poem, containing the exploits of all the sovereigns of
<em>Bóni</em>, from the reign of <em>Máta Se Sámpo</em>, the <em>menúron</em> of <em>Matájam</em>, down
to her own time; but it is not to be procured on the western side of
Celebes. It appears, however, that every <em>Búgis</em> family of high rank possesses
a very authentic history of that period, collected from the records
of the court of <em>Bóni</em>.</p>

<p>The author of the <em>Rupáma</em> is not known, nor indeed is the name of any
<em>Makásar</em> author known. The <em>Rupáma</em> is considered by the <em>Búgis</em>, as well
as the <em>Makásars</em>, to be of equal antiquity with the <em>Sawíra Gáding</em>. Copies
of both these works have been obtained.</p>

<p>In the account given by Dr. Leyden, in his valuable paper on the Hindi-Chinese
nations,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> upwards of fifty literary compositions in the language
of this country are enumerated, most of which serve either to celebrate
the deeds of their national heroes, or are of an amatory character. Besides
these they possess codes of laws, or rather customs, said to be of
considerable antiquity. The <em>Koran</em> has been translated into the <em>Búgis</em>
language. The use of rhyme is much less frequent than among the <em>Maláyus</em>;
and it has been observed by Dr. Leyden, that "the melody of the
verse depends on the rhythm, and the measure of some of the historical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxcvi" id="Page_mmxcvi">[Vol II Pg xcvi]</a></span>poems has, in this respect, considerable similarity to some of the specimens
of Sanscrit verse." The <em>Búgis</em> songs are very numerous, and in
high estimation throughout the Archipelago.</p>

<p>They have no books on science, philosophy, or astronomy. The only
stars they are acquainted with, are Jupiter (called <em>Pelás</em>), the Pleiades
(called <em>Wórong Pórong</em>), Sirius and Orion (<em>Jáng'an Jáng'an</em>, or the Fowl),
the Great Bear (<em>Jonga Jong'aya</em>), Navis (<em>Belikaipon</em>), and Antares (<em>Lambáro</em>).
They navigate their <em>práhus</em> by these stars, some of which must
always be in sight, if the weather be clear.</p>

<p>The <em>Makásars</em> use the Mahomedan names for the months. The <em>Búgis</em>
divide their year of three hundred and sixty-five days into twelve months,
beginning on our sixteenth of May. Whether this division of the year
has taken place since the arrival of Europeans or not, is uncertain; but
it is more than probable it has, as, with all this correctness, it does not
appear they have any era; at least since the introduction of Mahomedanism,
the Hegira seems to be used. The <em>Búgis</em> names of the months,
and the number of days they contain, are as follow:​&mdash;</p>

<p>Some division of time into months and years must have taken place at
a much earlier date; as some of the earliest of the present line of kings,
and the length of their reigns, are particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>I have before stated that slavery is practised on the island, and that the
states not only supply slaves for domestic consumption (if I may use that
phrase), but for export and commercial traffic. There are examples of
whole villages becoming slaves, and there is scarcely a state or family of
rank on the island that has not its assortment of these degraded beings,
many of whom are reduced to this condition by the most cruel and insidious
means.</p>

<p>Of the thousands exported annually from <em>Makásar</em>, the greatest portion
consisted of persons who had been kidnapped by people acting under the
authority of the European Residents, or the princes of the country.</p>

<p>The sale of their subjects constituted one chief source of the revenue
of the Rajahs; and the factors at the different Dutch residencies traded
in slaves. It is reported of one factor that he exported nine hundred in a
year. The payment or contribution to be made to the Dutch, was either
measured in gold, silver, or slaves. In a treaty made between the people
of <em>Gúa</em> and Admiral Speelman, we find that they promised to pay so much
of the precious metals, or one thousand slaves. Those slaves that were
obtained by law or descent, were called <em>Díngen</em>; those kidnapped, <em>Páras</em>.</p>

<p>The respective prices for slaves at <em>Makásar</em> were as follow:​&mdash;

<p>It appears from the report of a commission appointed to inquire into the
abuses of the slave trade in Celebes, addressed to the council of policy,
and dated <em>Makásar</em>, the 21st September, 1799, that the Dutch government
of Batavia, from the year 1699 (the period of the first Dutch
settlement at <em>Makásar</em>), had sent repeated orders for the prevention of
abuses in the slave trade in Celebes; with what effect, the following
extract from the same report will shew.</p>

<p>"The abuses which have successively crept in, and the intrigues which
are now practiced to obtain slaves, are so manifold and perplexing, that
it would be very difficult for us to enumerate or to trace them. In attempting
such a detail with all the precision and attention possible, we
should still ignorantly omit some things, and depict others in too faint
and indulgent a light, the grounds of our information being often superficial
and precarious; for, it is to be remembered, that the enormities
which are committed in this trade conceal themselves in the dark, and
it is only by accident that some traces of them can occasionally be discerned.
For these reasons, the undersigned request that they may be
excused for confining themselves to the most common and notorious
abuses, which, being faithfully recorded, may still afford sufficient evidence
of the dreadful and detestable crimes which spring from avarice,
and of the frightful shapes in which she perpetually displays herself, instigating
and exciting the vengeful and blood-thirsty passions of the
natives, and creating a fertile source of trouble and mischief.</p>

<p>"The making of a slave transport, if properly viewed, consists in nothing
more than this:​&mdash;A person, calling himself an interpreter, repairs,
at the desire of one who says that he has bought a slave, to the
Secretary's office, and accompanied by any native, who, provided with
a note from the purchaser, gives himself out as seller. For three
rupees a certificate of sale, in the usual form, is immediately made out;
three rupees are also paid to the notary, two rupees put into the hands
of the interpreter, the whole transaction is concluded, and the purchaser
has thus become the lawful owner of a free-born man, who very
often is stolen with his (the purchaser's) concurrence and co-operation.
He does not, however, trouble himself about that, because the stolen
victim is already concealed where nobody can find him. The transaction
also very seldom becomes public, because never were found more
faithful receivers than the slave-traders. It is a maxim with them,
never, as they call it, to betray their prison; a phrase which we shall
presently have the honour more fully to explain. But what will be
thought of the value of those public instruments, to which the name of
Slave Transports is attached, when at times it is found that both purchaser
and seller are fictitious, and that they are united in one league
with the interpreter. By such means it is obvious, that the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxcviii" id="Page_mmxcviii">[Vol II Pg xcviii]</a></span>
property upon a stolen man may be acquired with as much ease as if
he were pinioned before the door or within the yard of the pretended
purchaser, and with no greater cost than the small sum of one rupee, or
something more, according to circumstances, which must be put into
the hands of him who gave himself out for the seller. To find a person
for this purpose does not require a long search, for it is a very easy
trade to pursue, and there are numbers of the most profligate of the
natives continually roving about who do nothing else, and maintain
themselves exclusively upon such small profits; even the slaves of the
inhabitants being bribed, suffer themselves, for a small fee, to be thus
employed. The victim himself, who is stolen and sold, is never examined,
nor do the Dutch or native interpreters at all concern themselves
about the matter; they are not much afraid of the risk of their
responsibility; so that, at any time, it were possible to prepare beforehand
as many transports as might be required.</p>

<p>"Let us further represent to ourselves this, our town of <em>Makásar</em>, filled
with prisons, the one more dismal than the other, which are stuffed up
with hundreds of wretches, the victims of avarice and tyranny, who,
chained in fetters, look forward with despair towards their future
destiny, and taken away from their wives, their children, their parents,
their friends and comforts, languish in slavery, helpless and miserable!
We may picture to ourselves the condition of one (and how often do
such instances occur) who perhaps saw his aged father lose his life by
his side, in attempting to rescue the pride and comfort of his declining
years, whilst the survivor, incapable of further resistance, is torn from
him, robbed irrecoverably of what is most precious to every human being,
and carried away, in a condition more dreadful than death itself, a
condition of despair and uncertainty, in which that moment only shall
produce a change, when he is resigned for a trifle to the arbitrary will of
a master, who has paid the stipulated price, and acquired the right of
placing him amongst the number of his domestic animals, treating him
at times no better than he would do those creatures.</p>

<p>"If we would lift up another corner of the curtain, a scene no less
afflicting presents itself. Here we discover wives lamenting the loss of
their husbands, children missing their parents, parents missing their
children, who, with hearts filled with rage and revenge, run frantic
through the streets and before our doors, to do all that the filial love of
children for their parents, the tenderness of parents for their offspring
can inspire, in order, if possible, to discover where their dearest pledges
are concealed. Often, very often, is all their labour and trouble in vain,
being obliged to return back hopeless and comfortless to their afflicted
friends and relations. Sometimes, indeed, the profoundest secrecy is
not proof against their indefatigable scrutiny, and if they do by any
chance learn where a father, mother, a son or daughter, a husband or a
wife, is kept in concealment, hope revives within their bosoms, and
absorbed in the prospect of becoming their deliverers and saviours,
every sacrifice is considered trifling, by means of which they can regain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmxcix" id="Page_mmxcix">[Vol II Pg xcix]</a></span>
possession of the objects of their anxious care. But, alas! these unhappy
people have not as yet reached the end of their sufferings; an
obdurate purchaser, deaf to all the pleadings of distress, will be prepared
coolly to make his advantage of it, and proportionally to enhance
the ransom of his victim, till, by extorting an exorbitant price, he may
plunge the unhappy relative from a moderate property into indigence,
or, which is still worse, burden him with debts, which, sooner or later,
will reduce himself, and perhaps his whole family, to slavery!</p>

<p>"It must not be thought, that when these wretched people have thus
carried their point, and when, to furnish the sum demanded, they have
sold their houses and goods, or even pawned themselves<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>, that, after
the payment of the ransom agreed on, the matter is finished. No! the
trader will not deliver up the pretended slave until he departs for
Batavia: and if we ask, why? it is, that his prison may not be betrayed;
that is to say, that it may not become generally known throughout
the country, what numbers of stolen people he keeps shut up within
his prison, and that the cry of vengeance against many execrable acts
that are concealed in the dark, may not everywhere be heard, by which
many villains would become notorious. A son is therefore only exhibited
to the afflicted father: he sees him in a pitiful condition linked
with fetters, and it is frequently at such a moment that the ransom is
agreed on. The grief wherewith a father's heart is pierced at such a
sight, the rapid succession of his emotions from grief and despair to
hope and longing, when contrasted with the deliberate calmness with
which a covetous purchaser knows how to take advantage of the poor
man's distress; the indifference, the obstinacy, with which he persists
in his bloody demand of each rix-dollar, each stiver, nay almost of
each penny; in a word, every thing that can have any relation to such
a striking spectacle, can be more easily conceived than described, and
we have said enough to exhibit the abomination of proceedings, which
cannot fail to have a most pernicious influence upon society.</p>

<p>"But it may be said, the laws and regulations speak in favour of the
oppressed. We have shown above, in what manner government have
endeavoured, from time to time, to provide against such abuses, and to
this we beg leave to refer; but where avarice is predominant, laws,
reason, rights, humanity, all that is sacred, are too often compelled to
yield. Besides, various obstacles conspire, which time and local circumstances
have engendered, so that in spite of the most salutary statutes
(which are indeed so far nominally in force) the evil cannot be
effectually checked; and experience has taught us, that the most rigorous
orders which government could devise, would be insufficient to
make a due provision against the increase of these abuses.</p>

<p>"Those, whose fate we have now hastily drawn, are not always stolen
by foreign nations at distant places. No: about and near the houses
of our own inhabitants, in our <em>kampongs</em>, within our own town, it very
often happens. A numerous gang of villains, known by the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmc" id="Page_mmc">[Vol II Pg c]</a></span>
bondsmen (<em>verpandeling</em>), with a number of whom every slave-trader is
careful to provide himself according to his means, are most useful instruments
in procuring slaves in the easiest and cheapest way; and
being instructed in all the arts of villainy, and eager for prey, they rove
about in gangs during the night and at unseasonable hours, and if successful
in overpowering some one, they carry the victim to their employer,
or to any purchaser, and it is very seldom that any thing more is
heard of it, than that such a one has lost his slave, or that such a native
is missing. The stolen man, woman, or child, is already chained and
shut up within the prison of some slave-trader, which is never visited.
The slaves for foreign markets are always carried on board at night;
and if a stolen person were either free-born, or the slave of an inhabitant,
he dares not make himself known as long as he is in his ravisher's
hands, for, in that case, they would kill him immediately, even were it
before the door of the person who wanted to buy him, whilst the robbers
would have no difficulty in getting out of the way, and beyond the
reach of justice.</p>

<p>"Those who are trained to this business, whether bondsmen or slaves
(for even amongst this latter class of people thieves of men are often
found), are very fertile in all kinds of intrigues to accomplish their ends;
for except casual victims, who sometimes fall by accident into their
clutches, a considerable time will often elapse before they succeed in
securing the object they have marked out for their prey, because the
devoted creature is frequently on his guard; and as it cannot be done
openly without great precaution, for he would certainly sacrifice his
own or their lives to preserve his liberty; they, therefore, lie in wait
for him a long time, endeavouring by indirect means to make acquaintance
with him, in order to gain his confidence, and then, we will not
say always, to conduct or allure him into the house of the slave-trader,
or otherwise, as is sometimes the case, to lead him to a remote spot, or
at least to some distance from his house, when he immediately finds
himself attacked by two or three of these ruffians, who have long previously
agreed with his pretended friends, and before he has time to put
himself into a posture of defence, or to take hold of his <em>krís</em>, it is already
wrested from him, and his hands are tied behind his back. To cry for
help would be immediately fatal to him, he is therefore compelled to be
quiet, and to suffer himself to be sold as a slave by the ruffians who had
previously arranged where to carry him.</p>

<p>"Why such violations are so seldom made public, and thieves of men
are so rarely detected, many sufficient reasons may be assigned. For
instance: the profound secrecy of the prisons; the clandestine manner
in which slaves for traffic are carried on board in the dark of the night;
the sinister manner in which the purchase is transacted and confirmed;
the facility with which the villains are able to escape, when after some
time the theft becomes notorious; the difficulty of making satisfactory
inquiry about a crime, of which but a few of the perpetrators and their
accomplices are generally within the reach of justice, whilst the stolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmci" id="Page_mmci">[Vol II Pg ci]</a></span>
person is still more rarely present, so that it generally happens, in such
a case, that the most guilty get off; the still greater uncommonness of
offenders of this sort being caught in the very act, so as to fall at once
into the hands of justice; and, finally, the secret protection which some
native petty princes, living upon plunder, afford to their subjects. All
these, and many other circumstances, combine to facilitate the practice
of kidnapping, which thus goes on almost undisturbed, and generally
unpunished!</p>

<p>"A rich citizen, who has a sufficient number of emissaries called bondsmen,
carries on his trade much more easily than a poor one does. The
latter is often obliged to go himself to the <em>Kámpong Búgis</em> or elsewhere,
to take a view of the stolen victim and to carry him home; whilst the
former quietly smokes his pipe, being sure that his thieves will, in
every corner, find out for him sufficient game, without his exerting
himself otherwise than indirectly. The thief, the seller, the interpreter,
are all active in his service, because they are all paid by him. In some
cases the purchaser unites himself with the seller, on purpose to deceive
the interpreter; whilst, in other cases, the interpreter agrees with the
thief and pretended seller, to put the stolen person into the hands of the
purchaser! What precautions, what scrutiny, can then avail, when we
reflect, that the profound secrecy of the prisons, and the strict precautions
in carrying the slaves on board, are equalled only by the licentiousness
with which the transports are fabricated?</p>

<p>"A distinction ought, however, to be made between such illegal and
criminal practices, and a more moderate trade in slaves, many of whom,
it is true, are stolen, but not in our vicinity, nor in the districts of the
Company. The remainder are generally such as, according to the separate
laws and customs of the native nations of Celebes, have in some
way or other forfeited their liberty, either in war, or for some misdemeanour,
or on account of debts. These are likewise higher in price,
so that the trader cannot have so much gain upon them; they may also
appear at broad daylight, an interpreter may with security answer for
them. Such slaves can be brought on board very quietly in the day
time; the frequency of murder, as in other cases, is not much to be
dreaded, and our town has considerably less danger to apprehend from
these than from the class before mentioned."</p>

<p>The report concludes by recommending specific measures, and expressing
an opinion, that "it would not be inexpedient, if, but for one year,
the exportation of slaves from hence were suspended."</p>

<p>In the following year, the residents received instructions from the high
regency, in which several of their predecessors were accused of having
"assumed a despotic sway over the natives, plundered those over whom
they had been placed to protect them, and of having even dared, with
the assistance of the native chiefs, <em>whom they have found means to debauch</em>,
to put the natives in irons, and to sell them as slaves."</p>

<p>Mr. Chassé, when governor of <em>Makásar</em>, much to his honour, attempted
to put a stop to manstealing in the neighbourhood of his residency. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcii" id="Page_mmcii">[Vol II Pg cii]</a></span>
did not, however, succeed to any extent. When the British arrived, it
appeared that numbers of plunderers were roaming about for the supply
of the slave market, which was still open; so that the inhabitants of the
villages adjacent to <em>Makásar</em>, never dared to approach, except in parties of
at least five or six armed men. An equal caution prevailed throughout
the country.</p>

<p>To enforce the British abolition laws, there was formed at Batavia, in
the beginning of the year 1816, a society called the <em>Java Benevolent Institution</em>,
and in the course of the year this society published an account
of its proceedings, containing, among other interesting matter, "Remarks
upon <em>Makásar</em>, &amp;c. compiled from the information of Lieutenant Owen
Phillips, assistant resident there." This paper concludes as follows:</p>

<p>"The laws recognized between the Dutch Company and the states of
<em>Bóni</em> and <em>Gúa</em> may be considered a fair criterion of their general spirit
and tendency. They were agreed to in an early period of the Dutch
establishment, when Admiral Speelman concluded a treaty with those
states, and they have not since undergone any material alterations.
The penalties therein prescribed were required to be paid in money or
property of any description, at the arbitrary rates fixed by the same
laws, and which appear on the whole to be extremely favourable to the
individual; debtors or convicted felons, in default of payment, becoming
bondsmen. But the temptation to corruption afforded by an
open market and an increased demand for slaves for traffic, introduced
a practice of condemning, first to bondage, and then fabricating for
three dollars a certificate of slavery; a practice which, although not
recognized in the laws subsisting between the European and native
powers, was yet generally known to prevail, and if not formally
sanctioned, was openly tolerated under the former system.</p>

<p>"Whilst these laws are administered in the native states by their councils
or <em>becháras</em>, the administration of justice in the Company's territories
was vested in the Regent, under the superintendance of the
<em>Drost</em>, but who has usurped the power of actually deciding, particularly
in cases where he is interested in the condemnations, from the right
which the judge enjoys, of a moiety of the property arising from the
sale of persons condemned to slavery, or in the appropriation of a
certain number of them to his own use! The abuses arising out of
these unlawful usurpations appear to have attained a great height in
1799, when the commission was appointed to inquire into them; but
(as in the case of restraints which had from time to time been imposed
by law) that inquiry did little more than recognize the right of control
over the actors and participators in such abuses; a right which could
readily and profitably be compromised by men who, from habit, were
actuated by little determined abhorrence of such crimes, and no steady
resolution to eradicate them. To this cause alone must be attributed
the difficulties stated by the commission to be opposed to the due execution
of the laws, and to the suppression of the enormities that were
generally practised; and although partial reforms were effected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmciii" id="Page_mmciii">[Vol II Pg ciii]</a></span>
according to the disposition and principles of the persons who presided
successively in <em>Makásar</em>, the enormous gains to be derived from the
toleration of corruption was a powerful obstacle to its removal: and
it may be said of the abuses and enormities detailed by the commission
in 1799, that although perpetuated with more or less aggravation, as
the controuling authority was more or less conscientious and vigilant,
no radical removal of them took place, nor were the suggestions of
that commission carried into effect, except partially within the town of
<em>Makásar</em>.</p>

<p>"On the establishment of the British government, the practice and
mode of kidnapping within the town of <em>Makásar</em> had, in some degree,
been restricted and ameliorated; but this did not extend to the country.
Some limitations had therefore been imposed on the connivance and
direct participation of the public functionaries; but bondsmen were
still generally employed as man-stealers, and the practice of concealing
in secret prisons, of assassinations to prevent detection, and of midnight
embarkations, were but little controlled or inquired into, as may
be sufficiently inferred from the laxity of the public tribunals, and
the rare instances of any infractions of these laws being punished by
them.</p>

<p>"The introduction of the prohibitory laws by the establishment of
the British government, naturally operated to cause a sudden and complete
suspension of the open traffic; and although individuals are still
clandestinely carried from <em>Makásar</em>, the number is so small, that the
utmost vigilance has hitherto been unable to convict the perpetrators,
especially as the numerous gang of bondsmen and man-stealers, though
compelled at present to resort to other avocations, are yet at the call
of corrupt employers, and live in the hope that occasion may again
offer of freely returning to their pursuits, without apprehension of any
consequences. This truth will be more generally appreciated, if we
explain the course through which these people are led to engage in the
desperate trade of kidnapping. The bondsmen, who are thus employed
by slave-traders, are generally dissolute adventurers from the
native states, who repair to <em>Makásar</em>, perhaps, with a little property
which they lose by gambling; their next resource is to borrow from
some one of the numerous Dutch or Chinese speculators (slave-traders)
a sum of money, and which is only to be had at the exorbitant interest
of fifty per cent, or, as expressed in the local terms, 'one <em>wang</em> per
month on the Spanish dollar.' A debt thus dissolutely contracted is
not likely to be retrieved by patient industry. But were such a disposition
to prevail, the opportunity is scarcely afforded, and the obligation
is generally allowed to accumulate until the debtor is about to pay
the price in his captivity. To retrieve himself from this dire alternative,
he has recourse to the trade of kidnapping, and the ready employment
he meets with, added to the sudden gains which he hopes to
acquire, stimulate him to repair his fortunes in this irregular and
desperate pursuit. Such are the bondsmen who are the active agents
of slave traders in <em>Makásar</em>; and while the abolition has had the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmciv" id="Page_mmciv">[Vol II Pg civ]</a></span>-fold
effect of diminishing their numbers and of checking their depredations,
it must be obvious that this salutary reform can only endure
whilst the spirit which produced it is fostered. The commission in
1799 forcibly depicted the utter incompetency of the most rigid prohibitions,
in restricting the barbarities which then prevailed: but there
is yet a stronger fact, which bears equally upon the traffic, on whatever
footing it might be re-admitted; it is, that the resources arising from
what were considered legal condemnations to slavery, would be totally
inadequate to supply the market under any probable limitations. As
the demand increased, the more frequent condemnations on frivolous
pretences would naturally ensue, if indeed such a practice in any degree
could be considered legal: but the temptations to open violence
arising from the numerous accessaries, and the direct or indirect participation
of public functionaries, added to the comparative cheapness
of stolen men, are such strong inducements to revive ancient abuses,
under an actual demand, that no hope could be entertained of controuling
them. On the other hand, the maintenance of the abolition laws,
as they have hitherto tended to correct in a remarkable degree the
monstrous practices which obtained, must, in their ultimate operation,
effectually reform, not only the habits and dispositions of the inhabitants
of <em>Makásar</em>, but check those frequent condemnations which, in
the native states, may be chiefly imputed to the advantages that were
generally made of them. To illustrate, in a familiar instance, the effect
of this amelioration brought about by the silent operation of the prohibitory
laws; on the first arrival of the English, the inhabitants of
the adjacent villages did not dare to come to <em>Makásar</em> in parties of less
than five or six men well armed. This was equally the case throughout
the country, as there was an open sale for almost any number of
people that could be stolen. The case, however, is now entirely
altered, at least within the influence of the British authority. Men,
women, and children, are now to be seen moving singly about the
country in all directions, without fear and without arms. Formerly a
man going on a hunting party, or a peasant to till his ground, went
armed as if going to war; at the present day numbers of people may
be seen in the paddy fields without a spear amongst them. I may add,
that these effects are not confined to the Company's provinces, but are
felt nearly throughout the states of <em>Gúa</em>, <em>Telu</em>, and <em>Turáta</em>, where there
can be no doubt that a few years would be sufficient to realize, under
the present system, a great increase to population, and the more important
introduction of commerce and civilisation.</p>

<p>"The principal pirate settlements are <em>Káli</em> and <em>Túli Túli</em>, situated on
the north-west coast. The depredations of these hordes are generally
carried on between Java and the Straits of Saleyer; their haunts are
the islands near Seleyer, also <em>Gúnuny Api</em>, and the isles at the entrance
of the Bay of <em>Sembáwa</em>, and in general the small isles included between
the coasts of Java to the west, Borneo to the north, and Celebes to
the east."

<h2>APPENDIX H.<br />

TRANSLATION OF THE MÁNEK MÁYA.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>Before the heavens and earth were created, there existed <em>Sang yang
Wisésa</em> (the all-powerful). This deity, remaining in the centre of the
universe, inwardly and earnestly desired of the Almighty Ruler to grant a
wish that he had. A dreadful conflict of the elements ensued, in the
midst of which he heard a repetition of sounds, like the rapid striking of
a bell. On looking up he saw a ball suspended over him, and on his laying
hold of it, it separated into three parts: one part became the heavens
and earth, another became the sun and moon, and the third was man, or
<em>mánek máya</em>.</p>

<p>All having made obeisance to the <em>Sang yang Wisésa</em>, he addressed himself
to <em>Mánek máya</em>, and said, "Hereafter thou shalt be called <em>Sang yang
Gúru</em>; and placing entire confidence in thee, I give up the earth and
all that is attached to it, to be used and disposed of according to thy
will and pleasure." Having spoken thus, <em>Sang yang Wisésa</em> vanished.</p>

<p>The earth being in great distress, unfixed and liable to be driven to and
fro by every gust of wind, anxiously petitioned of <em>Sang yang Wisésa</em> that
its situation and condition in the universe might be fixed. The sun,
moon, and sky, deeply affected with the distress in which the earth was,
all came to lend their assistance; a violent hurricane at the same time
arose, and, by their united influence, the earth became still and fixed, the
contending waters then receiving their saltness and disposition to turbulence.
The continual presence of the sun and moon occasioned perpetual
day. <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, empowered by the deity, then directed that
those two luminaries should show themselves alternately, relieving each
other by turns; the sun dispensing light and heat during the day, and at
the close thereof entering into the bosom of fire; the moon continuing to
light the earth by night, for fifteen days in a month, and descending in
due season into the bosom of the waters.</p>

<p>At the request of <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, the deity granted that he should
have nine male and five female children born unto him, without the
assistance of a mother.</p>

<p>One of the sons, called <em>Mahadéwa</em>, being furnished with one of the
daughters, called <em>Mahadéwi</em>, as a wife, was sent to preside in the east. He
was, moreover, provided with a fort and palace of silver, a sea of cocoa-nut
milk, and a white <em>pári</em> bird. His letters were <em>ha</em>, <em>na</em>, <em>cha</em>, <em>ra</em>, and <em>ka</em>,
(the five first letters of the Javan alphabet), and his day, <em>légi</em> (which signifies
sweet).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxiii" id="Page_mmcxiii">[Vol II Pg cxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>The second son, <em>Sang yang Sámbu</em>, was sent to preside in the south:
the daughter allotted to him for a consort was <em>Sangyána</em>. His <em>kráton</em> was
of copper; his bird was a <em>bhramána</em> kite; his sea was of blood; his letters
were <em>da</em>, <em>ta</em>, <em>sa</em>, <em>wa</em>, and <em>la</em>; his day <em>páhing</em>.</p>

<p>The third son, <em>Sang yang Kamajáya</em> (the most beautiful), was sent to
preside in the west: the daughter allotted to him for a wife was <em>Dewi
Ratéh</em> (which signifies the most beautiful female). His <em>kráton</em> was of
gold; his sea was of honey; his bird was a <em>kapádong</em>, or yellow minor;
his letters were <em>pa</em>, <em>da</em>, <em>ja</em>, <em>ya</em>, and <em>nia</em>; his day was <em>pon</em>.</p>

<p>The fourth son, <em>Sang yang Wísnu</em>, was sent to preside in the north:
the daughter allotted to him for a wife was <em>Sri</em>. His day was <em>wágé</em>; his
<em>kráton</em> was of iron; his sea was indigo; his bird was <em>gága</em>, or crow; his
letters were <em>ma</em>, <em>ga</em>, <em>ba</em>, <em>ta</em>, and <em>nga</em>.</p>

<p>The fifth son, <em>Sang yang Báyu</em>, was appointed to preside over the centre
of the earth: the daughter allotted for his wife was <em>Dewi Súmi</em>. His
<em>kráton</em> was of bell-metal; his day was <em>klíwon</em>; his letters were <em>ga</em>, <em>lang</em>,
<em>nia</em>, <em>ma</em>, <em>ma</em>, <em>la</em>, <em>pa</em>, <em>ya</em>, and <em>a</em>; his sea was of hot water; his bird was a
<em>gogek</em>.</p>

<p>The four remaining sons were appointed to preside in the north-east,
north-west, south-west, and south-east quarters, respectively.</p>

<p>The god of the north-east was <em>Sang yang Pretanjála</em>, and the letter
attached to him was named <em>b'ya</em>.</p>

<p>The god of the south-east was <em>Sang yang Kwéra</em>, and the letter attached
to him was named <em>narasúnya</em>.</p>

<p>The god of the south-west was <em>Sang yang Mahayákti</em>, and the letter
attached to him was named <em>gandéa</em>.</p>

<p>The god of the north-west was <em>Sang yang Séwa</em>, and the letter attached
to him was named <em>norwíti</em>.</p>

<p>These arrangements being made, <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> went under the earth
to put things to rights there. The earth consisted of seven regions, one
under the other, like so many folds. In the first region he appointed the
goddess <em>Déwi Pratiwi</em> to preside; in the second region, a god named
<em>Sang yang Kusíka</em>; in the third region, a god named <em>Sang yang Gáng'ga</em>;
in the fourth region, a god named <em>Sang yang Sindúla</em>; in the fifth, <em>Sang
yang Dasampálan</em>; in the sixth, a god named <em>Sang yang Manihára</em>; in
the seventh region, a god named <em>Sang yang Anta Boga</em>, and who was head
over all the others.</p>

<p>Then <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> returning from under the earth, and observing
that it was depressed towards the west, and elevated towards the east,
summoned all the deities to a consultation respecting what might be the
cause of this inclination. The deity of the west said that it was in consequence
of a large mountain that was towards the west, and whose
weight bore down the earth in that quarter. <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then
directed that the mountain should be removed from the west and placed
in the east, so as to preserve the earth in due balance. All the deities
were accordingly forthwith dispatched to effect the same.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, at the same time, got <em>Sang yang Wisésa</em> to create him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxiv" id="Page_mmcxiv">[Vol II Pg cxiv]</a></span>
a Vulcan or <em>Empu</em>, whose name was <em>Ramádi</em>. Of this Vulcan, his mouth
served to supply fire, his right and left hands served respectively to hold
and beat his work, while his knee answered the purpose of an anvil.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>Besides <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, <em>Sang yang Wisésa</em> created another degree of
mankind, viz.: <em>Sang yang Derma Jáka</em>, who, having humbled himself
before <em>Wisésa</em>, petitioned him to bestow on him a son, which was granted,
and his son's name was <em>Chátur Kanáka</em>.</p>

<p><em>Chátur Kanáka</em> having previously done penance, petitioned <em>Wisésa</em> to
grant him a son, which he did, and his son's name was <em>Sang yang Kanekapútra</em>.
This <em>Kanekapútra</em>, who was superior in abilities to all the other
created beings, being grown up, was sent by his father to do penance in
the ocean, who gave him at the same time a precious stone, called <em>rétna
dumíla</em>, fraught with the wonderful power of rendering its possessor insensible
to hunger, cold, thirst, &amp;c. and which completely fortified him
against the effects of water, fire, &amp;c. <em>Chátur Kanáka</em> also instructed his
son to remain quiet and silent during his penance.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The deities who were sent to remove the heavy mountain which weighed
down the west end of the earth, were so fatigued with the labour it cost
them, that they were all very thirsty. In looking out for wherewithal to
quench their thirst, they discovered issuing from the side of the mountain
a clear stream, of which they all drank and died shortly after, the
water being impregnated with poison.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> himself having come to the mountain, and being also
very thirsty, drank from the poisonous stream: perceiving, however, in
time that the water was not good, he immediately vomited it, and so
saved his life. The only bad effects of it was a blackness which remained
about his throat, and from which he received the appellation of
<em>Níla Kánta</em>. The water was called <em>chála kúta</em>, which signifies the most
potent poison.</p>

<p>On a further search, <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> discovered another stream issuing
from the summit of the mountain, and of which the water was of an aromatic
and excellent quality. The name of this water was <em>kamandálu</em>, and
was so called from its having the property of bringing the dead to life.</p>

<p>Instructed by <em>Wisésa</em>, <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> drank of the life-giving water,
and at the same time carried with him some of it, in order to give it to
those deities who had died in consequence of their having drunk of the
death-giving stream. On the water being applied to their lips they all
immediately revived.</p>

<p>What remained of the mountain on removing it from the west to the
east formed the hill called <em>Tempaka</em> (at <em>Chiríngin</em>, in Bantam).</p>

<p>In the course of the conveyance of the mountain towards the east, a
piece of it dropt off, and became the large mountain in Bantam, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxv" id="Page_mmcxv">[Vol II Pg cxv]</a></span>
<em>Gúnung Kárang</em>. Other pieces falling off became the mountains <em>Hala
Húlu</em>, near <em>Pajajáran</em>, <em>Gúnung Géde</em>, the mountain called <em>Chermái</em> (which
is in <em>Cheríbon</em>), and the <em>Gúnung Agung</em>, (which is in <em>Tegál</em>).</p>

<p>The fragments which continued to fall all the way along, on either
side of the large mountain, during its conveyance from the west to the
east, formed the two ranges of hills stretching along the south and north
coasts, and known by the name of <em>Gúnung Kéndang</em>.</p>

<p>Two large pieces fell off and formed the Brothers, called <em>Sindóro</em> and
<em>Sindári</em>, or <em>Súmbing</em>. The deities employed in transporting the mountain
stopped to rest themselves in that part of the country afterwards known
by the name of <em>Kedú</em>; and the perspiration which then ran off their
bodies was the cause of that country being so well supplied with water.</p>

<p>These deities seeing <em>Ramádi</em> above in the clouds, at his ease compared
with them who were working so hard, asked how he came to be there so
much at his ease? He replied, that he was ordered by <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>
to remain there and work for the gods. High words, and at last a battle,
ensued, in which all the deities were defeated. So great was the power
of <em>Ramádi</em>, whose mouth sent forth flame, and whose breath was fatal to
those exposed to its baneful influence.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> interposed his authority, and having appeased the combatants,
the deities returned to the work of carrying the mountain. More
pieces of the mountain dropped, and formed the mountains <em>Merápi</em> and
<em>Merbábu</em>, into which the volcanic fire they have ever since contained was
then breathed from the nostrils of the fiery Vulcan <em>Ramádi</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ramádi</em> then asked <em>Wisésa</em> to give him a son, which was granted, and
his son's name was <em>Bráma Kadáli</em>. <em>Bráma Kadáli</em> resembled his father in
every respect, and was equally powerful and formidable.</p>

<p>Other pieces of the mountain dropt, and formed the mountains <em>Láwu</em>,
<em>Wílis</em>, <em>Antang</em>, and <em>Klut</em>, besides a number of small hills. What remained
of the mountain when it had reached the east, was set down and formed
the <em>Gúnung Semíru</em> (which is in the country now called <em>Proboling'go</em>),
the height of which reached the sky.</p>

<p>Having removed the mountain from the west to the east end of the
island, the several deities presented themselves before <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>,
who then ordered them to take <em>téja</em>-grained wood, earth, and stones, for
the purpose of making him a heaven of the most transcendant beauty, it
being his intention to vie with the Almighty himself; and in order that
he might be on an equality with the Almighty, he gave orders for the
construction of a <em>báli márchu kúnda</em>, which should resemble the <em>âras</em> of
the most divine; and like unto the <em>Súrga Púrdos</em> he made the <em>Surga
Loka</em>. To resemble the <em>Yamáni</em> he formed a <em>káwah</em>; corresponding to
the <em>Wailul</em>, or hell of perishing cold, he made <em>Endut Blagdába</em>, or the
place of filth; similar to the bridge <em>Seratal mastakim</em> he made the bridge
<em>Ogalágil</em>. He at the same time made himself as many <em>jawátas</em> as the
Almighty himself had <em>malaikat</em> (or male angels), also 100,001 <em>widadáris</em>
(or female angels), the odd one being <em>Batárī Ráteh</em>. <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>
further provided himself with a consort, whose name was <em>Batári Uma</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxvi" id="Page_mmcxvi">[Vol II Pg cxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>All this having been accomplished, the <em>Jawátas</em> and <em>Widadáris</em> assembled
under the <em>báli márchu kúndo</em>, and began to drink of the <em>térta komandálu</em>,
or invigorating beverage, which soon made them quite happy.</p>

<p>While they were still quaffing, <em>Rémbu Chúlung</em>, one of the <em>Rasáksa</em> (who
are the dregs of creation) having observed them, descended from above
and joined the party. When one of the <em>Jawátas</em>, called <em>Chándra</em>, perceived
this, he made a motion to <em>Wísnu</em> to apprize him of it. Before
therefore the beverage, which the <em>rasáksa</em> had applied to his lips, had
time to descend into his stomach, <em>Wísnu</em> shot an arrow into his throat
and stopped his passage. The head only of the <em>Rasáksa</em> (being all that
experienced the effects of its immortalizing quality) re-ascended, and became
the devourer of the sun and moon (observable at eclipses); the
whole of the rest of the body perished. Hence originates the great noise
and clamour which is always made on an eclipse of the sun or moon, the
object of those who make it being to drive away the animal which on
those occasions attacks the luminaries, and thereby produces what are
termed eclipses. * * *</p>

<p>(The scene which follows is too indelicate to be inserted).</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> immediately dispatched all the deities to destroy it,
and to prevent its growing into any thing gross or unnatural.</p>

<p>The deities accordingly went forth and commenced their attack, darting
all their missile weapons at it. Instead, however, of suffering from the
effects of their weapons, it only increased in size, and forthwith began to
assume a shape, of which the weapons called <em>cháhra deksána</em> formed the
head, those called <em>lampang mang'gala</em> formed the two shoulders, and those
called <em>gáda</em> the rest of the body. The former being now complete, and
of a very terrific appearance, all the deities were greatly afraid and ran
away from <em>Sang yang Kála</em>, the name of the monster, as it continued to
pursue them. The deities fled to <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> for protection and
assistance, informing him of what had happened, and telling him, at the
same time, that the <em>Sang yang Kála</em> was advancing in order to inquire and
find out who was his father.</p>

<p>The <em>Rasáksa</em> immediately made his appearance, having eyes like the
blazing sun, hair long, lank, and clotted with filth and dirt, his body
covered all over with hair like a wild beast, and large tusks sticking out
of his jaws.</p>

<p>Thus disfigured, he stood before <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, and asked him who
he was? The latter replied, that he was a powerful being and the ruler
of many deities. "If that be the case," said <em>Sang yang Kála</em>, "then
must thou be able to tell me who my father was?" <em>Gúru</em> then said,
"I know thy father, and will inform thee who and where he is, provided
you comply with what I shall require of thee."</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Kála</em> assented, and then inquired what it was that <em>Gúru</em>
wished him to do. "That," said <em>Gúru</em>, "I will point out to you, and if
you fail to do it, I will instantly devour you. You must, in the first
place, however, make obeisance to me." While the <em>Rasáksa</em> was in the
act of prostrating himself before <em>Gúru</em>, the latter plucked two hairs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxvii" id="Page_mmcxvii">[Vol II Pg cxvii]</a></span>
his head: upon which the former opening wide his mouth, <em>Gúru</em> thrust
his hand into it, and wrenched out his tusks and the poison which was
at their roots. The poison he deposited in a small vessel, and of the
tusks he formed two weapons, called <em>limpung</em> and <em>neng'gála</em>, so heavy that
it required seven hundred men to lift one of them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then confirmed to the <em>Rasáksa</em> the name of <em>Sang yang
Kála</em>: after which, becoming greatly enraged with his consort, he seized
and held her by the toe, upon which she began to bellow, and was immediately
transformed into a female monster, receiving the name of <em>Dúrga</em>.
He then gave her to <em>Sang yang Kála</em> for a consort, and allotted them for
a place of residence the island called <em>Núsa Kambángan</em>, where they continued
to live very happily.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then ordered the deities, <em>Bráma</em> and <em>Wísnu</em>, to go and
destroy the forty children of <em>Rémbu Chúlung</em>, the devourer of the sun and
moon. They accordingly destroyed all the children except one, named
<em>Putút Jantáka</em>, whose severe penance alone saved him.</p>

<p>After this <em>Gúru</em> saw in his sleep an appearance like a rainbow, and
which seemed to be portentous of some great event. <em>Sang yang Támban</em>
being sent by <em>Gúru</em> to make inquiries respecting the nature and meaning
of this sign, which, from its being in the water, he termed <em>súba síta</em>, <em>Támban</em>
went under the water, and saw there a devotee, who, notwithstanding
his situation, was quite unwet from the water, and undergoing the penance
of remaining perfectly still and quiet.</p>

<p><em>Gúru</em> being informed of this, and feeling jealous of what the devotee
might gain by his penance, became very desirous of causing him to break
his vow: he accordingly sent a number of <em>Dewátas</em> and <em>Widadáris</em> to
tempt the hermit. On their reaching the spot where the latter was, they
were not asked to sit down, and were completely disregarded by the hermit.
<em>Bráma</em>, who was one of those sent, then observed to the hermit,
that such haughty and neglectful conduct was highly unbecoming, and
that if it proceeded from ignorance, on his part, of the rank of the persons
sent to him, he begged to inform him that they were the messengers
of the Great Deity, and ought to be attended to.</p>

<p>These words making no kind of impression on the hermit, who continued
obdurately silent, the deity, <em>Sang yang Séwa</em>, then advanced, and
addressing himself to the hermit, spoke thus: "Holy hermit, be not
offended with what <em>Bráma</em> has just said to thee. I come not to disturb
or annoy you, but merely to apply to you for the means of curing
the sickness of <em>Batári Uma</em>, who has been taken very ill." Neither
this, nor any other of the devices which the rest of the deities successively
had recourse to, succeeded in making the hermit break his silence.
The deities, however, being determined to do all in their power to
make the hermit break his vow of uninterrupted silence, <em>Sang yang
Sámbu</em> took a vessel of water and emptied it upon him, while others, at
the same time, began to belabour him with sticks. Notwithstanding
all this, the hermit persevered unshaken in his resolution of maintaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxviii" id="Page_mmcxviii">[Vol II Pg cxviii]</a></span>
a dead silence. Seeing this, <em>Sang yang Báyu</em> came up and began to
batter his head with stones, which, instead of doing any injury to
that usually tender part, were only broken themselves into many pieces.
<em>Bráma</em> had then recourse to fire, which he heaped about the hermit,
so that he was, for a considerable time, entirely concealed from the
view, by the vast flames thereof, and supposed to be completely destroyed.
When the fire had done burning, however, the hermit was observed to
continue in the same situation as before, uninjured by the destructive
element, and, like gold, only the more pure and beautiful.</p>

<p>Astonished and exasperated at all this, the deities then began to assail
the hermit with all their various weapons, viz. 1. <em>chákra</em>; 2. <em>kónta</em>;
3. <em>hardadáli</em>; 4. <em>neng'gála</em>; 5. <em>parátu</em>; 6. <em>límpung</em>; 7. <em>pasopáti</em>, and
8. <em>trisúla</em>. The body of the hermit proved invulnerable. The deities
then, quite confounded and ashamed of their failure, returned to <em>Gúru</em>,
and informed him of all that had been done.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then went himself to the hermit, and asked him what
it was he wished to obtain by his penance, telling him at the same time,
that if he was desirous of having beautiful and accomplished virgins, he
had plenty at his service. Receiving no reply, <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then said
to him, "I know what the object of this penance is, and I should possess
very limited power if I did not know every wish of thy heart. Thou
art ambitious of supplanting me in the power and rule which I hold in
heaven; but thou deceivest thyself. Wert thou to do penance for one
thousand years, while I should continue to enjoy myself in a series of
uninterrupted pleasures, thou wouldst never be able to come near to me
in power or glory; for after <em>Téja</em> or <em>Cháya</em> (which signifies light or
brightness), <em>Búmi</em> (the earth), and <em>Lángit</em> (the sky), I stand the next
eldest work of creation; and the power superior to these just mentioned
is <em>Sang yang Wisésa</em>, who is the oldest and greatest of all."
Upon this the hermit could contain himself no longer, but, bursting into
laughter, said, "Thou art wrong, and what thou hast said of <em>Sang yang
Wisésa</em>, is true of the Almighty himself only, whose displeasure thou
hast consequently incurred by what thou hast just stated. Know that
I am <em>Sang yang Kanekapútra</em>; and to prove to thee that I know better
than to believe what thou hast said of <em>Sang yang Wisésa</em>, I would only
ask thee who could have been the cause of those sounds which were
heard by <em>Wisésa</em> before the heavens and earth were. Without doubt
they were occasioned by a power older and greater than him."</p>

<p>On this <em>Gúru</em> was silenced, and had not a word to say. He then entreated
<em>Kanekapútra</em> to tell him who this eldest and most powerful being
was, proposing, at the same time, that he should go with him, and become
joint ruler over the deities in heaven. "These sounds," answered <em>Sang
yang Kanekapútra</em>, "were the voice of the Almighty, signifying his will
that there should be created things of an opposite nature to each other,
as male and female, above and below, father and mother, beautiful and
ugly, &amp;c. &amp;c.​&mdash;every thing created having its opposite, except thee and
me, who are one and the same."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxix" id="Page_mmcxix">[Vol II Pg cxix]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Sang yang Kanekapútra</em> and <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then ascended to heaven,
and seated themselves on the <em>Báli márchu kúnda</em>. After they had remained
there for some time, <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> perceiving a case belonging
to <em>Sang yang Kanekapútra</em>, to remain constantly shut, inquired of him the
cause thereof, and was told by him that it contained the most precious of
all precious stones, which had the wonderful power of making the possessor
of it feel neither hunger, cold, nor thirst, &amp;c. and which fortified
him against the effects of water, fire, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> heard this, he requested to have the stone; but
<em>Kanekapútra</em> told him it was of so subtile a nature, that it would pass
through the hands of innumerable people, and would never remain with
any one but him destined to be the possessor of it. <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>
asked <em>Kanekapútra</em> to part with the stone, and give all the other deities an
opportunity of getting it, provided it should not remain with him. <em>Kanekapútra</em>
then threw up the precious stone, and <em>Gúru</em> caught hold of it.
It not only passed through his hands, but also through the hands of all
the deities who successively caught and attempted to retain it. The precious
stone then falling down upon the first region of the earth, where
presides the deity <em>Pratiwi</em>, dropped successively through all the others,
without the presiding deities <em>Bagáwan Kusíka</em>, <em>Sang yang Gáng'ga</em>, <em>Sindúla</em>,
<em>Drampólan</em>, and <em>Manik Kóga</em>, being able to retain hold of it, till,
coming to the last region, <em>Anta Bógo</em>, the presiding deity, who was in
shape like a dragon, opened his mouth and swallowed it.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then asked <em>Sang yang Kanekapútra</em> what he should do
to become possessed of the precious stone? <em>Kanekapútra</em> replied, he must
go and search for it as far as even the seventh region of the earth. <em>Sang
yang Gúru</em> approved of this, but at the same time wished that <em>Kanekapútra</em>
should go himself, accompanied by all the deities. <em>Kanekapútra</em> accordingly
set off, and on his arrival at the different regions, was successively
told by the presiding deities, that the <em>retna dumíla</em> had slipt through
their hands, and had passed down into the seventh and lowest region.
When he came there, he and all the deities who accompanied him, were
kindly received by <em>Anta Bógo</em>. <em>Kanekapútra</em> then told <em>Anta Bógo</em> that
<em>Gúru</em> was desirous of having the precious stone, and would be greatly
obliged by his giving it up to him. <em>Anta Bógo</em> declined compliance, and
immediately his body became extended so as to encircle the whole of his
region. It is further reported that he had ninety nostrils. <em>Kanekapútra</em>
perceiving that <em>Anta Bógo</em> was making a display of the power he possessed,
gave orders for all the deities to enter his body by his various
nostrils, and to make search for the vessel called <em>chúpu mánek astagíni</em>, in
which the <em>rétna dumíla</em> was deposited.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Wisésa</em> seeing what had taken place, reprimanded the parties concerned
for their folly and mistake, and at the same time ordered that they should
all forthwith depart out of the body of <em>Anta Bógo</em>. He next desired that
the body of <em>Anta Bógo</em> should be carried away by the deities, in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxx" id="Page_mmcxx">[Vol II Pg cxx]</a></span>
manner in which they had formerly carried the mountain. On their way
with it to <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, the body decreased gradually in size, till it
vanished entirely.</p>

<p><em>Kanekapútra</em> was highly incensed against <em>Anta Bógo</em> for his provoking
conduct, and was just going to complain of it to <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, when,
to his surprise, he perceived <em>Anta Bógo</em> himself under the seat of <em>Sang
yang Gúru</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> seeing <em>Kanekapútra's</em> displeasure increase, he requested
he would not be offended with <em>Anta Bógo</em>, as his conduct was merely
intended for a little merriment. <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then desired <em>Anta Bógo</em>
to deliver up the <em>chúpu mánek astagína</em>, which he accordingly did.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Gúru</em> not being able himself to open the <em>chúpu</em>, handed it
over to <em>Kanekapútra</em>; but neither he nor any of the other deities, who
successively attempted to open it, could succeed. <em>Anta Bógo</em> was then applied
to: but he said, that so long as he had had the <em>chúpu</em>, it opened and
shut of itself, without his knowing how. Holding up the <em>chúpu</em>, <em>Sang
yang Gúru</em> then threw it down with great violence; upon which it broke
in pieces, and vanished from the sight. The <em>chúpu</em> and the <em>rétna dumíla</em>
which it contained then became, the former a <em>Báli simarakáta</em>, the latter a
virgin, to whom <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> gave the name of <em>Tesna-Wáti</em>, and who
continued to remain in the <em>Báli símarakáta</em> till she grew up. <em>Sang yang
Gúru</em> afterwards taking a fancy to this virgin, wished to make her his
wife. She consented, on condition of his giving her such proof as she
required of his divinity and power, and that was by his supplying her
with three things, viz.: 1. A suit of elegant apparel, which would last her
for ever without being in the least tarnished; 2. A meal which would
cause her never to feel hunger more; 3. A musical instrument called
<em>gatóplak</em>, of the most melodious sound. All these <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> promised
to get for her on her agreeing to prove faithful to him.</p>

<p>In furtherance of his intentions, he ordered the deity <em>Chítra lága</em> to go
to <em>Núsa Kambángan</em> and call <em>Sang yang Kála</em>. When <em>Sang yang Kála</em>
came, <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> desired him to bring his son, called <em>Kála Gamárang</em>,
in order that he might dispatch him in search of the three things required
by the virgin, <em>Tesna Wáti</em>.</p>

<p>To induce <em>Kála Gamárang</em> to exert himself in procuring them, <em>Sang
yang Gúru</em> told him, that if he should be successful, he would be rewarded
by the privilege of coming to heaven whenever he chose, without molestation
from the other deities.</p>

<p><em>Kála Gamárang</em> then took leave, bellowing and making a great noise, so
as to alarm and bring out all the deities, whom, as they stood in his way,
he insulted and disgraced by striking some, and spitting in the faces
of and treading upon others. Highly indignant at such base treatment,
the deities, one and all, pronounced a curse upon him, that he should
never be allowed to defile heaven with his presence, and that he should be
transformed into a wild beast.</p>

<p><em>Kála Gamárang</em> then proceeded to a place called <em>Táman Banjáran Sári</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxi" id="Page_mmcxxi">[Vol II Pg cxxi]</a></span>
where he saw <em>Déwi Sri</em> (the wife of <em>Wísnu</em>) bathing in the azure main,
(or <em>Segádra Nila</em>). Enamoured by the enchanting display of the naked
beauties of that lovely female, his whole soul was fired with such an irresistible
desire, and so rivetted and attracted was he, that he unconsciously
rushed forward towards her, when she, greatly terrified, and
leaving all her clothes behind, ran off with all speed to her husband.
<em>Kála Gamárang</em> pursued the lovely fugitive till she reached the abode of
her husband <em>Wisnu</em>, and being informed on inquiry of him that she was
his wife, <em>Kála Gamárang</em> demanded her of him. <em>Wísnu</em> consented to let
him have her, provided she herself would consent. The question being
put to her she refused to go to <em>Kála Gamárang</em>, who then said that her
not liking to come to him was all a pretence, and nothing more than one
of those tricks which the female sex are constantly in the habit of practising.
On <em>Kála Gamárang's</em> attempting to carry her away by force,
<em>Wísnu</em> whispered her to run off to <em>Mendang Kamúlan</em>, and enter and take
refuge in the body of the king's wife, called <em>Dérma Nastíta</em>. <em>Wísnu</em> at
the same time disappeared. <em>Kála Gamárang</em> followed, and continued to
pursue her over hill and dale, and through jungle and forest, till becoming
tired and exhausted, she was on the point of being overtaken, when
<em>Wísnu</em>, causing his weapon to be changed into the root end of a rattan,
it got entangled about the legs of <em>Kála Gamárang</em>, and threw him down.
Notwithstanding that, however, <em>Kála Gamárang</em> still attempted to pursue
her, when she, aware of the advantage she then had over him, cursed
him, and pronounced him to be a hog, which he immediately became.
<em>Kála</em> then attempted to stand upright, but he could not. Resolved, however,
not to desist from the attempt to obtain the object of his desire, he
said within himself, that he would follow and pursue her into whatever
recess she might betake herself. Coming to a river, he saw the image of
what he now was.</p>

<p>When <em>Sri</em> reached <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em> she entered the body of <em>Dérma
Nastíti's</em> wife, who was most beautiful. <em>Wísnu</em> at the same time went
into the body of the king himself, and assuming the title of <em>Prábu mang
ngukúhan</em>, became the first king of Java. <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> being informed
of the fate of his messenger, <em>Kála Gamárang</em>, sent again to the virgin,
<em>Trésna-Wáti</em>, to entreat her to become his. This, however, she positively
refused, on any other terms than those she had already made known to
him. Upon this, <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> began to embrace her. The resistance
she made, joined to the rough and violent manner in which he proceeded,
caused her to expire in his arms. He then sent for <em>Kanekapútra</em> to carry
her body to <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>, and there bury it in the wood, called
<em>Kéntring Kendayána</em>, which he ordered to be previously put in order for its
reception.</p>

<p>The body being buried there, from its head sprung up a cocoa-nut
tree, * * *. From the hands grew up plantain trees, from the teeth Indian
corn, from other parts <em>pari</em>, &amp;c. &amp;c. The <em>pari</em> was guarded
by * * * and over these three was placed a head called <em>Ráden Jáka</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sang yang Pretanjála</em>, the deity of the north-east, anxious to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxii" id="Page_mmcxxii">[Vol II Pg cxxii]</a></span>
where <em>Wísnu</em> was, ascended into the air, and having looked down and
seen some fine rice growing, he immediately descended in the shape of a
bird, and began to devour it. <em>Ráden Jáka</em> perceiving this, threw a stone
at the bird and frightened it away.</p>

<p><em>Kála Gamárang</em> (the hog) having ascertained where <em>Sri</em> was deposited,
went to the wood <em>Kéntring Kendoyána</em>, and began to eat of what grew
there. When <em>Wísnu</em> saw this, he changed his weapon from the root end
of a bambu into that of pointed bambu stakes, which being trod upon
by the hog, caused blood to issue. * * *</p>

<p>The birds which came to eat the <em>pari</em>, and which were frightened away
by those who guarded it, flew up into a tree, which, from the retreat it
afforded to the birds, received the name of <em>Arén</em> (<em>Lirénan</em>, signifying a
place of refuge). <em>Ráden Jáka Púring</em> then ordered the protectors of the
<em>pári</em> to make a flight of steps up the tree, and to lop off the branches. In
doing this, the juice which issued from the tree being tasted, was found
to be sweet and capable of making sugar, which was then first discovered.</p>

<p>Some of the juice of the tree being carried and presented to <em>Wísnu</em>,
was ordered by him to be taken to <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> by <em>Kanekapútra</em>.</p>

<p>On <em>Kanekapútra</em>'s opening the hollow bambu in which it was contained,
previously to presenting it to <em>Sang yang Gúru</em>, the fermented liquor flew
up into his face, and caused him, when he tasted it, to put out and smack
his lips with pleasure and satisfaction. <em>Sang yang Gúru</em> then ridiculed
him for his simplicity, and pronouncing in ironical terms his opinion
thereof, the words were irrevocable, and <em>Kanekapútra</em> then had his lips
turned up, his hinder parts pointed and projected, a gruff voice and a pot-belly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the children of <em>Pútut Jantáka</em>, the first was in form like a white rat
and about the size of a dog, and was named <em>Tíkus Jenánda</em>: he had an innumerable
host of followers. The second was in shape like a hog, and
was named <em>Demálung</em>: he also had thousands of followers. The third
was in shape like <em>Kutíla</em>, and had likewise many followers. The fourth
was like a buffalo, and was called <em>Maisa Dánu</em>. The fifth and sixth were
<em>Kála Sering'gi</em> and <em>Kála Músti</em>, and resembled the male and female <em>bánténg</em>,
or wild bull and cow. The next was <em>Ujang</em>, and was in shape like a <em>kídang</em>,
or small deer. The next, <em>Kirandé</em>, was like a stag. The next,
were like sea and land tortoises.</p>

<p>All were greatly distressed for want of food, and annoyed their parent
by constant craving for it. The father then told them to go to <em>Méndang
Kamúlan</em>, where they would find all sorts of produce; enjoining them,
however, to take nothing without first asking for it. The children, one
and all, immediately answered in an assenting voice, and forthwith repaired
to <em>Méndang Kamúlan</em>, where they arrived in the middle of the night,
and being very hungry began to help themselves to what they saw before
them, without leave or ceremony. The persons who guarded the <em>pari</em>
(<em>júru sáwah</em>) heard the noise they made, and were at a loss to know what
it was. At last one of them came out with a torch in one hand, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxiii" id="Page_mmcxxiii">[Vol II Pg cxxiii]</a></span>
large knife in the other. When the son that was like a hog saw him, he
ran towards him to attack him, and received a cut in the head, which, as
he was invulnerable did him no harm. When the <em>júru sáwah</em> found that
he could not cut the hog, he immediately assembled all his fellows, who
commenced an attack upon the hog, and whose numerous torches made
the night as light as the day. Unable, however, to hurt him, they went
with <em>Ráden Jáka Púring</em> to report to <em>Prábu Méndang Kamúlan</em> what had
happened. The king then gave orders for all his people to go with whatever
weapons they could muster, and use their utmost endeavours to kill
the animals which had got amongst and were destroying the various
plants. With the king at their head, all the people who could be assembled
went forth to destroy the noxious animals. When the latter saw the
host approaching, they made a vigorous charge and dispersed the enemy,
who were unable to make any impression on their invulnerable bodies,
but received themselves many wounds in various parts of the body. The
king then recollecting something prophetic of the event, instantly retreated
with all his people, pursued by the victorious animals to a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>The king then dispatched his younger brother, the <em>Júru Sáwah Ráden
Jáka Púring</em>, to his old friend at <em>Méndang Agung</em>, who was called <em>Andong
Dadápan</em>, and also to <em>Ké Géde Pengúkir</em>, who was along with the former,
to solicit their assistance in extirpating the wild animals, which had, as
they must well know, overcome the king and all his people.</p>

<p><em>Andong Dadápan</em> and <em>Ké Gedé Pengúkir</em> were found sitting. Another,
named <em>Ráden Séngkan</em>, then came up, as also <em>Ráden Jáka Púring</em> himself,
who kissed the feet of the two first mentioned, having his own feet kissed
in turn by <em>Ráden Séngken</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ráden Jáka Púring</em> then began to inform them of all that had taken
place; but <em>Andong Dadápan</em> told him there was no occasion to proceed,
as, from his divine power, he was perfectly acquainted with the circumstances.</p>

<p><em>Andang Dadápan</em> and <em>Ké Gedé Pengúkir</em> signified to their respective
sons, that they wished them to call their warriors, whose names were
<em>Wáyu yang</em> and <em>Chándra Máwa</em>. The first, who belonged to <em>Andang Dadápan</em>,
was black, short, stout, round-shouldered, pot-bellied, with a short
neck, large ears, whence exuded a waxy substance, red eyes, a projecting
forehead, a snub nose, with long hair hanging over his forehead. The
second, who belonged to <em>Ké Gedé Pengúkir</em>, was short, of an awkward
appearance, having a long neck and a small head.</p>

<p>When those two extraordinary persons made their appearance, their
masters placed them under the orders of <em>Jáka Púring</em>, and at the same
time furnished him with a short spear and a stick, instructing him, when
he unsheathed the former, to keep it always pointed towards the ground.
<em>Ráden Turúnan</em> and <em>Séngkan</em>, which were the names of the sons of the
two warriors, also presented <em>Jáka Púring</em> with a bambu cane, with which
they instructed him to beat violently, when he should be in need of their
assistance, promising that they would immediately be with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxiv" id="Page_mmcxxiv">[Vol II Pg cxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Jáka Púring</em> then returned to the king of <em>Méndang Kemúlan</em>, and presented
to him the two warriors, &amp;c. The king then ordered all his
people to prepare for an attack upon the wild beasts, which was not attended
with any better success than before.</p>

<p>The two warriors, who had remained behind drinking, the one cocoa-nut
water, and the other rice water, being perceived by the queen (<em>Déwi
Dérma Nastíti</em>), were reprimanded by her for skulking, while all the
others were engaged in fight, and were accordingly recommended by her,
in the event of their not choosing to bestir themselves, to return whence
they came.</p>

<p>Ashamed of themselves, the two warriors began to weep, and having
entreated her forgiveness, they repaired with the rapidity of lightning to
the scene of action. When they reached it, <em>Wáyu yang</em> had himself
washed with rice water, and the dirt which was scraped off his body was
formed into a <em>black dog</em>, with a streak of white extending from the tip of
his nose along the ridge of his back, to the extreme point of his tail.
This dog was called <em>B'lang Wáyung yang</em>. <em>Chándra Máwa</em> having had
his body cleaned with cocoa-nut water, the dirt which was got off it became
a <em>white cat</em>, with a corresponding black streak from the tip of its
nose to the end of its tail.</p>

<p>This wonderful dog and cat were then directed to go and attack these
destructive animals. Commencing with the hog, the dog, after having
dispatched him and all the more fierce and strong animals, killed the
monkeys, and others which he could not follow up the trees they ascended,
by the powerful sound of his voice alone; while the cat busied
herself in putting an end to the rats, and such other animals as she was
peculiarly calculated to destroy.</p>

<p><em>Kalamúkti</em> and <em>Kála Seréng'gi</em>, distressed and enraged on account of
the death of their brothers (the noxious animals), who had thus been exterminated,
petitioned their father, <em>Pútut Jantáka</em>, to permit them to go
and revenge themselves on the authors of such a dire calamity. This
being granted, these powerful personages, whose bones were as hard as
iron, their skin like copper, sinews like wire, hair like needles, eyes like
balls of fire, feet like steel, &amp;c. went forth, and in the strength of their
rage made a road for themselves, by tearing up trees by the roots, and removing
every other obstacle which stood in their way.</p>

<p>The two <em>Kálas</em> attacked them with such fury, that the warriors flew up
into the air, and then darting down, carried off the almost dead dog and
cat, which they then put down again in a place of safety at some distance,
where they washed their bodies with cocoa-nut and rice water, and rubbed
them with bambu leaves. In shaking themselves to dry their skins, a
number of hairs fell out of both dog and cat, and became respectively so
many more animals of the same species.</p>

<p>All of the dogs and cats thus produced commenced an attack upon the
<em>Kála</em>, but without being able to make any impression on them. Compared
to them, they were only like so many ants by the side of the mountain
<em>Merápi</em>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxv" id="Page_mmcxxv">[Vol II Pg cxxv]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Ráden Jáka Púring</em> perceiving that the dogs and cats were no match for
the <em>Kálas</em>, immediately began to beat with the <em>bámbu</em> which was given
him to use in times of distress. <em>Ráden Séngkan</em> and <em>Turúnan</em> forthwith
made their appearance. Being armed each with a rattan, seven cubits in
length, and of a most exquisite polish, they beat the <em>Kálas</em> till they were
nearly dead. <em>Wáyu yang</em> and <em>Chándra Máwa</em> then secured the two <em>Kálas</em>
with ropes, and tied them to a tree.</p>

<p>On recovering from the miserable state into which they had been
beaten, the two <em>Kálas</em> began to lament this unhappy fate. Their father,
<em>Pútut Jantáka</em>, hearing their cries, determined to attack the enemy himself.
Proceeding with <em>Ujong Randi</em>, he found on his way a large square
stone, measuring ten fathoms: throwing this stone high up in the air,
and placing himself under it, so as to receive it upon his head, the stone,
instead of breaking his head, was itself broken into several pieces.</p>

<p>At this mighty deed he became transformed into a large and frightful
monster. In this new shape he attacked the enemy, who being dreadfully
alarmed at this horrid appearance, betook themselves for protection to
their master the king.</p>

<p><em>Ráden Jáka Púring</em> then coming out and pointing his unsheathed spear
towards the ground, it immediately sent forth a huge snake, in size like
a tall tree, and whose poisonous breath was like the smoke of a crater.
This snake was a species of the <em>sáwah</em> kind.</p>

<p>On <em>Pútut Jentáka's</em> reaching the royal presence, he found that the king
no longer appeared in his former and assumed character, but had returned
to that of himself, viz. <em>Wísnu</em>. <em>Jentáka</em> was so much confounded and
alarmed at this unexpected and wonderful event, that he was greatly
terrified, and ran away to hide himself among the scarecrows in the rice
fields. The king pursued him for a short distance, and then returned
with all his people. On their way back one of the <em>jùru sáwahs</em>, called
<em>Kiai Túeh</em>, began to boast of <em>Jentáka</em> having run away from him, and the
ludicrous manner in which he spoke of <em>Jentáka</em> occasioned great merriment
among the party. While holding forth in his own praise, and in disparagement
of <em>Jentáka</em>, he happened to come against the scarecrow where
<em>Jentáka</em> was, upon which <em>Jentáka</em> immediately shewing himself, put on
such a horrible look as quite petrified <em>Kiai Túeh</em>, and made him drop
apparently dead with fear. The king being informed of this then came
up, when <em>Kiai Túeh</em> seeing the king, and being no longer afraid of <em>Jentáka</em>,
got up, and walked off. This circumstance occasioned all the people to
laugh very heartily.</p>

<p>On the king's approaching <em>Jentáka</em>, the latter addressed him thus:
"I beg your pardon for what has happened. I have no wish or intention
to be your enemy: on the contrary, I am ready to become your humble
slave, and to do whatever you command me." The king accepted his
proffered friendship and services, and told <em>Jentáka</em> that he would dispose
of him as follows, viz. that he should reside under <em>lúmbungs</em> (or granaries),
and live upon such quantities of rice as should exceed that which the
owner calculated upon having. That he, and all his family and posterity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxvi" id="Page_mmcxxvi">[Vol II Pg cxxvi]</a></span>
should also inhabit the troughs in which rice is beaten out, and the fireplaces
of kitchens, also the front courts of houses, of the highways, and
dunghills, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The king then commanded that all persons, after beating out rice, or
after washing it in the river, or after boiling it, should leave a small
quantity, as food for <em>Jentáka</em> and his family.</p>

<p>The snake of the <em>sáwah</em> species, above spoken of, having gone over all
the cultivated grounds which had been destroyed by the wild and noxious
animals, and caused them all to be restored to their former state, extended
itself along the ridges of the rice fields and died. The king hearing this
was greatly distressed, and on approaching to the place where the snake had
expired, instead of its dead body he beheld a beautiful virgin, elegantly
dressed out in maiden attire. The king was struck with her appearance,
and going up to her spoke thus: "Lovely damsel, my only life, behold
thy brother, who comes to carry you to the palace he has prepared for
you, and in which he will be ever happy to guard and protect you;
when there thou shall reign sovereign mistress."</p>

<p>The virgin, who was called the <em>Lúeh Endah</em> (or the most beautiful
damsel), replied that she felt much honoured by his handsome compliments
and kind intentions, and that she would be most happy and willing
to meet his wishes; but as a proof of the sincerity of his protestations of
love and affection, she required of him that he should come every morning
and evening to the rice fields, and that on his having done so she would
consent to be his wife. Having spoken to this effect, the lovely virgin
disappeared. The king was at first inconsolable for the loss of her, but
recovering himself, he returned to his palace with all his retinue.</p>

<p>The country became very rich and productive, living and provisions of
all kinds being very cheap and the people all good and happy.

<p><em><span class="smcap">Translation</span> of an <span class="smcap">Inscription</span> in the ancient <span class="smcap">Javan</span>, or <span class="smcap">Kawi</span> Character,
on a Stone found near <span class="smcap">Surabaya</span>, and sent from thence to Bengal, to the
Right Honourable the <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of <span class="smcap">Minto</span>.</em><a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p></div>

<p>(Date) 506. Verily know all the world, that the <em>Pandítas</em> wrote on
this object of veneration describing the greatness of the <em>Rátu</em>, and that
the whole is inserted on a stone prepared for the purpose.</p>

<p>When first this large stone was considered a place of worship, people
were accustomed to swear by it: it was held in great respect, and considered
a repeller of impurity. To this is added, with truth and sincerity
of heart, a relation of the perfection of the monarchy, the provinces of
which are flourishing. His empire is renowned for the excellence of its
laws, and his knowledge most evident and undoubted: the <em>Rátu's</em> name
<em>Srí Wíjáya</em>, and place of residence <em>Lorkóro</em>. Certainly he is firm who
gives stability to virtue. His <em>Pepáti</em> is named <em>Bráta Wismára</em>, celebrated
in the world: whose advice is constantly had recourse to by the <em>Rátu</em>, and
necessary to him like the Beryl of the ring to the stone, because he assists
him in the conduct of affairs, and is quickly heard by the <em>Déwas</em>. When
at war he can increase the arms an hundred-fold to annoy the foe. And
that <em>Páti</em> is admired by the women; but this does not withdraw him from
attention to the country, and the <em>Rátu</em> confides in the conduct of the
<em>Páti</em>, and the <em>Ratu</em> gave orders to make images. No other than <em>archas</em>
were made, fifty in number, all erect; and they are deified, being placed
to that end in order, on consecrated ground.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <em>Rátu</em> is not sparing of his own property, and continues seeking
the comfort of his chiefs. He arranges all kinds of pictures agreeable to
their respective stations in the apartment of his queen. It is related of
that <em>kadáton</em>, that figures of rhinoceroses are carved on the walls, which
are railed with iron and barred across; its floor most clean and shining,
a stream of water running along the foot of the wall, with a flood-gate to
open or shut exactly where it should be; and the chief of the watchmen
distributes the guard to their respective posts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Be watchful of such knowledge as is real. The virtue of good men is
like gold which is hoarded up; apparently they possess nothing, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxviii" id="Page_mmcxxviii">[Vol II Pg cxxviii]</a></span>
reality what they develop is sharpened by addition: they are spoken of
throughout their career as blameless until their death, their ashes are then
adorned and embellished, as well as held in veneration, and the virtues
these possess are very great and without fail. If difficulty should arise,
do you ask assistance with a heart pure and undefiled; and if you have
any urgent petition to make, do it with submission. Clothe yourself
entirely clean, throw off what is not so, and what you have to bring
forward let it be with propriety. When it is known to the deity what your
wishes are, they will be quickly complied with openly to your satisfaction,
and made to correspond with the devotion manifested. And the knowledge
of what is requisite in sincere supplication is this: to punish yourself;
to divest yourself of hearing; to reject evil-doing of all kinds; to
have your eye fixed on one; to seek the road to the bestower of benefits;
to desire without delay, and not to trifle. Yea, the formed stone which
is reverenced, is to be considered only a veil between you and the real
divinity. Continue to supplicate for whatever are your desires that they
may be known: when the blood will have stopped three times your object
will be gained; verily, it will be added to, there will be no obstacle to its
full completion. By one saying your solicitation is directly expressed, and
correctness of life is obtained. And what you say is like the sun and
moon: in proportion as reverence is paid to the deity, men know that
their supplication will be listened to, and the <em>Batára</em> become familiar and
much attached. Your existence will be as bright as the sun and its
splendour, which is evident, truly beautiful. When you die you will be
guarded and aggrandized, and not without companions. Such will be his
lot who seeks the good of the country, for he furthers the happiness of
the people.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Do you observe this course until you excel in it. Make figures of stone
like human beings, which may be supplicated; persons who reject them
will suffer sickness and ruin until their death, which will be most bitter:
on that account it is necessary to entreat and pray for the favour of the
<em>Déwas</em>. Stones situated in places of worship are ornamented with many
articles of state; they are feared by those who wish to ask forgiveness,
and cannot be destroyed.</p>

<p>It is related, that only persons who are stedfast in the acquirement of
letters, cause such as the following to be made (here follow fifteen cabalistic
characters, which are totally unintelligible): those will certainly
serve the purpose of your forefathers, who have been the medium of
existence; they are the veil which separates you from that which is
exalted, and also written on the stone. Give credit to them in a moderate
degree.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>First, let all pray to and seek the favour of the deity in this and the
next world, and each require an interpreter who will obtain his pardon:
but he must reject fickleness to arrive at a discriminating heart. Speak
with reverence to your parents, their existence is replaced by those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxix" id="Page_mmcxxix">[Vol II Pg cxxix]</a></span>
are named after them. In the place of worship, when the ornament of
good works is shewn, it is mentioned in the same manner as delight, as
established gratification. It is difficult to cause advantage to the workings
of the heart; your faith, which you received from <em>Sang yang Sudriya</em> and
<em>Sang yang Táya</em> is acknowledged by the extent of your ability, and is
different from other feelings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Different are the rewards of those who come to heaven; happiness is
bestowed on them; delightful their state; verily they have arrived in the
land of silver. Whatever your reward at your death may be fixed at,
when obtained it cannot be lost: all is settled, the whole is distributed,
as well as the certainty of death. Truly you are directed to a place which
is exalted, pointed out by <em>Déwas</em>, who preside at death and become your
guide; because the dead are mixed in a land which is wide and level, are
given occupations and quickly go, each flying to the first place until they
arrive at the seventh. Verily they at length come to the extremity with
those who accompany: there are none among them who have been terrified:
the existence of the body is dissolved and lost. There are none
acquainted with books who are terrified.</p>

<h3><em>On the Face of the Stone.</em></h3>

<p>The year of this inscription being made on a solid stone was 467, in the
season <em>Katíga</em>. It was made by a <em>Pandíta</em> skilful, and who performed
wonders; to relate, explain, and make known the greatness and excellence
of the <em>Rátu</em> (prince), in order that your actions too may speedily become
clear and manifest; yes, that will be your <em>kadáton</em>. That <em>Sri Rája</em>, ever
surrounded by majesty and his family, observes a correctness of conduct
grateful to the pure <em>Déwas</em>, and by <em>Mántris</em> exalted by the <em>Rátu Bráma
Wijáya</em>, celebrated in the universe for his eminence, whose empire is firm
and not to be shaken. Such is the <em>Rátu</em>; yes, he who caused to be inscribed
on a stone all these his actions, observant to the utmost of the
forms of worship, moderate in his complaints of distress, whose appeals
are correct and most true and without guile, and have enabled the slave
to associate with the divinity, without there being a difference between
them. He is my father, who is implored and who caused my existence:
do not trifle; there is no one greater than he. What remains to you to
solicit, mention it with humility; yes, that too is what mankind must
observe. Do you watch and observe the duties of mankind, and you will
certainly profit; reject entirely sayings which are improper and untrue,
and avoid theft, robbery, anger, boasting of prowess and false promises,
for they are despicable, and their effect, like the atmosphere, giving heavy
rain which overflows, to the accomplishment of wishes, improving the
cultivation, making all fresh and equally bright and sparkling; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxx" id="Page_mmcxxx">[Vol II Pg cxxx]</a></span>
wind of which is presently strong and cuts off the buds. If you ever
wish to fortify your soul, go to the summit of a mountain, which is the
place for earnest supplication in silence, awaken your firm and sincere
heart, let there not be any dregs of your nature; but let the soul assume
non-existence and pray. Be aware of the disorders of the demon of bad
actions, who inimically annoys and misleads; undoubtedly, if you conduct
yourself with firmness, you will approach to perfection, and seclusion
will truly be there. Let there not be a mixture of discontent of
mind. Cast away the veil however delicate it may be; truly it is better
conversing with letters which have been written; what they convey to
you will be most painful to the body, but your hopes will be accomplished.
Do not give place to the evil thoughts which have occupied the
minds of men and are most vexatious; fortify yourself so that you recede
not; remember well the three established powers of mankind. Commune
with the wise in words which are seen proceeding from the mouth; truly
faith is different from what is heard of your corrupt body, which is the
ornament of human life. Let the actions of superior men who seek stability
be examples to you like the <em>krangrang</em> ant; the indication which
you make cannot be disapproved, those persons certainly may be accounted
near to the wishes of the country. Sometimes clear, sometimes
obscure, yes, such indeed let your situation be, so that the train of your
actions may become most direct and manifest, as by day the sun lights all
places, so their benefit be not thrown away, and you may cast off care
and sorrow. Truly the departure of life is most uncertain. Human
nature, when it will not receive advice, is like a stony plain without
grass, animals will not approach, all remain at a distance from it. I will
teach you: pay attention and fail not to receive instruction, so that you
approach most nearly; but first purify your heart which pays reverence,
not reverence which is heard by the ear. Yes, that is indeed true devotion
which I have taught you, and without which there is no purity, for
a perfect heart is derived from the Deity. Words proceeding from the
mouth are vain to the utmost, their effect not to be depended on. The
devotion of a pure heart is like moonshine, not hot but cool and delightful;
the beauties you see in which the stars are scattered over as though
in attendance on the moon, adding to the grandeur of the scene. And
also a person becoming a <em>Rátu</em> commands his subjects and distinguishes
good people from bad, for the limits of this country are all under his
orders. The <em>Rátu</em> selects from his subjects such as are eligible to be his
associates, and they are four, who become the pillars of the state, and
cause its happiness and welfare; he thereby shews a pattern for future
<em>Rátus</em>. Further, too, as you have been given life, do not reject the precepts
of the <em>Sástra</em>, which have been diffused through the world by the
virtuous, but weigh them in your mind, for that is the duty of a slave;
bad and good are from your Lord. So the wisdom of man is extended
like the firmament, immeasurable even by the bird <em>garúda</em>, which knows
how to fly in the heavens, though he should arrive at the extremity of
space; such is human wisdom. Do not be surprised at people's conver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxxi" id="Page_mmcxxxi">[Vol II Pg cxxxi]</a></span>sation,
though it correspond not with the dictates of the <em>Sastra</em>; yes,
that is most injurious to morals. Even should one become a <em>Rátu</em>, if he
knows not this he certainly will not succeed, he will not arrive at the
height of his wishes; because the action of a vicious heart is different
from the inclination of a pure one, which is in attendance on its Lord.
And a living man should know the advantages of these places, which are,
the earth, the sky, and the space between; for to-morrow, when dead,
your body and soul will be there; before it knows the road it will change
its habitation into a living being; there, if you find enjoyment, you may
search for a place, because you have discernment from the heart. But a
man who is so while he lives, effects it by abstinence and moderation in
eating and drinking. Yes, in the time of <em>Rátu Dérma Wangsa</em>, when he
began to benefit the country, that <em>Rátu</em>, it is related in history of former
times, would not depart from his word, and all his subjects were devoted
to him. And when the <em>Rátu</em> sat in his <em>kadáton</em>, his conversation with his
wives was very sweet, as well as his playfulness with them. His wives
were therefore much attached to him, and by the <em>Rátu's</em> wisdom being so
great, he was sought after by women, and was very watchful in his attentions
to them: of that there is no doubt, and thus too the wisdom of the
<em>Pandíta</em> is like that of the bird <em>garúda</em>, in obtaining food without trouble
from the very great power and sagacity which it possesses; the same
arises from the <em>Pandíta</em>. Yes, the reason of letters having been formed
by the point of a knife is that you should recollect the way which is
correct, and that is no other than reverence to the <em>Batára</em>; yea, devoting
yourself to the <em>Batára</em> is the height of human excellence. While a man
lives, he should day and night ask pardon from the <em>Batára</em>. For what was
first written in letters, and they are a cause of eminence to him, was by
the <em>Pandíta Pangéran Aji Saka</em>; yes, he who has left his mark to the
<em>Rátus</em> of Java, for those <em>Rátus</em> made places of worship, named <em>Sangga Pamalungan</em>,
and placed in them drawings of their forefathers: but when
they prayed they petitioned the <em>Batára</em> only for their existence, that when
they died they should inhabit their places, quickly changing their bodies,
because their former bodies had returned to the pristine state, that is to
say, earth, water, fire, air. So says the <em>Sástra</em>.</p>


<h3><em>On the Left Side.</em></h3>

<p>And the powers of letters, which are forty-seven, keep those in your
mind, so that they be within you all of them. I will establish them in
such a manner that they can be brought forth by your three fingers; those
who are skilful may make good letters. Do not neglect the application
of letters, give each its proper place, for those letters are most useful in
the transactions of the people of this world during their continuance in
it. Thus the use of letters to the nations of the world is to open the
hearts of ignorant men, and to put in mind persons who forget; for I
give directions to men who can write, in order that the whole of the
knowledge I have in my breast may be known: and this I have taught
you, because that knowledge is the essence of the body and illuminates it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxxii" id="Page_mmcxxxii">[Vol II Pg cxxxii]</a></span>
And you who have wives and children to look after, do not make light of
it, for a woman, if she truly do her duty to her husband, is invaluable;
she is a printer of clothes, a spinner, weaver, sempstress, and embroiderer;
a woman such as this do you cherish, for it will be creditable to you.
If a married couple love each other, whatever they wish they can effect,
that is the way by which you can attain your wishes. So too a woman
towards her husband, even to death; yes, she follows to the <em>pasétran</em>
(place of depositing the corpse) or the place of self-sacrifice; this is
taught in letters which have been written on tablets; truly those writings
are like histories, which explain every kind of science. But the fate of
man cannot be learned or known by letters; such as a person's being
able to acquire profit, knowledge, poverty or distress: of these there is no
certainty. However, do not you reject the sayings of letters. It is your
evil inclinations that destroy your bodies; for he who first made war, his
magic was very great, because he could throw off the passions of mankind,
like <em>Arjuna</em>, whose power in war and in mounting his chariot was
celebrated, for he was guarded by all the <em>Dewas</em>; yes, he could become a
<em>tapa</em> (a devotee, released from the wants, &amp;c. incident to mankind) and
pray fervently. <em>Arjuna</em>, when he became a <em>tapa</em>, annulled his body, his
heart did not stray from his duty to the <em>Dewas</em>; his wishes were therefore
complied with until his death; yes, <em>Arjuna</em> was indeed favoured by his
<em>Dewas</em>. And on any one of your forefathers dying and ascending to
heaven, do you immediately make a picture to personify that forefather;
and do you adorn and provide it with all sorts of eatables, and respect it
as your forefather who has descended to you, and will administer to all
your wants: such will be the case with a person who pays respect to his
forefathers. At night burn incense and many lamps: truly <em>Sang yang
Jagat</em> (the omnipotent) and <em>Sang yang Suria</em> (the sun) will be favourable
to you; for <em>Sang yang Suria</em> is the enlightener of the world, and every
day gives light to darkness. A man who has arrived at the half of his
term of life conceives well the separation of his soul from its covering;
your existence is like that of the moon, that is to say, from the new to
the full, and from that to its extreme wane on the twenty-ninth day of its
age. When the moon is thus lost from the east, it will then certainly appear
in the west, and recommence the first day of its age. While you live
ask from those who know the setting of the soul; a person who knows
that is certainly discovered by his actions. But it is best losing that
covering by four causes, water, fire, air, earth; if it is lost by means of
those four, the body will certainly quickly be removed, in the same manner
as gold which is purified, verily, its colour will become like that which
is old. Thus the <em>Pandíta</em> makes preparations for prayer. The best mode
of praying is by familiarizing ourselves with seclusion, which is by excessively
torturing the body; but if you should have been much reduced,
your soul will not arrive at those three places. Should a man become a
<em>Rátu</em>, his soul is one selected by the <em>Dewas</em> which has been introduced
into a covering, and that covering is not a covering which has not been
favoured by the <em>Dewas</em>, truly a covering which has been elevated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxxiii" id="Page_mmcxxxiii">[Vol II Pg cxxxiii]</a></span>
<em>Dewas</em>, for its good fortune has been very great. The descending of that
good fortune from heaven is not like clouds dropping rain, which, if it
fall, does so equally on all vegetations. Look at mankind; if you contemplate
its state when living, its existence is no more than that of a
herb which shoots up on the face of the earth. Concerning your soul, it
is like dew, which hangs on the points of grass: such is its state.</p>


<h3><em>On the Back of the Stone.</em></h3>

<p>It is further related of the three particulars of his state, which it is
requisite should be the ornament of a man, as well as of a man becoming
a <em>Rátu</em>. Those three things are a handsome woman, arms, and a house;
the first, because a woman is the dispeller of grief from a heart which is
sad; the second, because arms are the shield of life; the third, because
a house is medicine to a fatigued body. Let not a man be at a distance
from the above-mentioned, for they are the ornament of a living man.
This stone is the means of facilitating the access to the <em>Dewas</em> of your
supplications, for human nature is feeble and very faulty towards the
Supreme. And moreover, if you have formed any wish in the world,
then ask assistance from that stone, and adorn that stone with all kinds
of perfumes and eatables which are most grateful. If you do so, certainly
the <em>Batára</em> will be ashamed not to grant you whatever you desire, because
the life and death of man are the same; but his body, to appearance,
is worthless when deserted by the soul, and remains of no further
use in the earth: it is better, therefore, that it should be lost, so that it
return to its original. It is different when the soul is there during life.
If you wish to seek for food there are many modes to adopt, so that you
gain a subsistence, such as becoming a blacksmith. There are some who
are goldsmiths; others who draw figures of different kinds; some practice
cookery; those who understand no trade gamble; some thieve;
some plunder. Yes, such as these are influenced by the passions, which
are violent in their action and make the faculties morbid. Of the things
forbidden by the <em>Sástra</em>, the first is deceit; the second, pride; the third,
hypocrisy: cast these away from you. If you are a good man, do not
make a habit of mixing with the bad; for those bad persons have been
marked by the <em>Dewas</em>, because they cannot do good. You do well in
associating with learned people, who have followed the sayings of the
<em>Sástra</em>; make those your inseparable companions and attach yourself to
them. But do you not despise the poor and the timorous, and do not be
ashamed before the bold and the rich; do not very much elevate yourself,
better you be humble amongst men: curb your passions, for your passions
are an enemy within you. So, too, it is with pleasure and pain;
they are like the <em>mayang</em> flower without fruit, truly as yet uncertain. It
is the same with a living person who has not yet arrived at the end of
life, he will be very much misled by his riches: there are poor who become
rich. Like the state of a fool who is unconscious of his real situation,
that fool suffers pain from himself, because his actions are of his
own dictating. In his own mind he asks, Who is there like me? I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxxiv" id="Page_mmcxxxiv">[Vol II Pg cxxxiv]</a></span>
a <em>gada</em> (a warlike instrument), who dares cope with me? Such a person
is like a mountain which thinks, "I am large! I am high!" Afterwards
it is trodden under foot and defiled by all kinds of animals, but is unconscious;
so too says the fool, but no one cares for him. As to the sign
by which to know such a fool, you have it from his harsh speaking and
obstinate heart; he is without politeness and has confidence only in his
own powers. And that fool, if he become great, uses an umbrella on a
moonlight night: surely, one who does so, has no shame, no sense; a
white ant seeking its food does not act in that manner. Let the wise man
observe the conduct of the white ant, its caution in searching for food;
even a large tree, an embrace in size, becomes consumed. So can men
do who are united, whose wishes are similar, for there is no performance
of living men so well executed as by unanimity. All great actions are
owing to the union of many men, not to violence; for if your conduct
be true and sincere, your heart, in whatever your wishes may be, will be
enlightened by the Supreme. And besides, if in like manner you pray
to and adore the <em>Dewas</em>, certainly the <em>Batára</em> and all the <em>Dewas</em> will bestow
favours on you. Such as I have mentioned are the precepts held out by
virtuous men of former times: different from the subject of animals being
brought up by men.</p>

<p>In case a man in the service of a <em>Rátu</em> be at length advanced to dignity
by that <em>Rátu</em>, and is given a village, if he fail to weigh how much he
should with propriety be in attendance on that <em>Rátu</em>, and this arise from
being engaged in his own pleasures, he must certainly lose his situation.
It is the same with a man being a <em>Rátu</em> who is not provided with scales,
and investigates matters too superficially to benefit his subjects; he is, in
truth, like a pond without water, which of course is entirely void of fish:
account him one who has received favour. And again, do you evermore
obey the commands of the <em>Pandítas</em>, and do not deceive your <em>guru</em>
(spiritual guide), or you will surely go to hell eternally. Better you obey
your <em>guru</em>: your excellence will descend to your sons and grandsons, who
will profit by your goodness. Oh! living man, do not fancy your life
permanent, although you are great, little, rich, or poor. When you have
arrived at the end of life your body will be corrupt, it cannot be otherwise:
yes, all are earth. When alive, people gather together wherewithal
to bury their body, so that it mix not with the earth, and that is only by
paying reverence to the <em>Batára</em>. All that live in the world are not like
mankind, who have been given wisdom and excellence by the <em>Batára</em>.
Although the <em>rátu</em> (king) lion is said to be the chief of animals, yet he is
held captive by man: the same with the <em>garuda</em>, the king of birds, which
resides in the air, it is likewise subject to the commands of man. It is
different with the sun, the moon, the earth, the sea, the air, the firmament,
the stars; they certainly are not under the orders of man, but they are
subject to be accounted good or evil in their course; like clouds which
discharge rain, and that in the rainy season are delightful to the husbandman.
But be it known to the cultivator, that he who superintends the
implements of tillage is the son of a <em>Dewata</em>, named <em>Sang yang Kalamerta</em>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxxv" id="Page_mmcxxxv">[Vol II Pg cxxxv]</a></span>
he is very good, for he protects all the cultivation in the country. It is
that <em>Sang yang Kalamerta</em> who, from the first, has caused terror to all such
subjects as do not obey the commands <em>Batára Guru</em>: because that <em>Sang
yang Kalamerta</em> has been empowered by <em>Batára Guru</em> to destroy first all
vicious persons; secondly, evil speakers; and thirdly, liars. These three
vices do you reject; and you will do well in asking forgiveness from the
<em>Batára</em>, so that you avoid the fury of the <em>Sang yang Kalamerta</em>.</p>


<h3><em>On the Right Side.</em></h3>

<p>And such is the case with merchants, who understand circulating
money, and can calculate on the return it makes for five times; such as
the profits of money laid out, and how much that will amount to which
has been laid out, and how much the loss on that money will be, and how
much the profit thereon, so that, by that means, they may be satisfied
during life. Concerning those men who seek wealth: before they commence
gaining all persons laugh at them; but when they profit, those who
before laughed approach and ask their favour. Persons who profit are
compared by <em>Pandítas</em> to flowers after a shower of rain, in appearance
very beautiful, but in existence not permanent. And let not a living man
discontinue supplicating his <em>Déwa</em>, so that the favours bestowed on him
by the <em>Déwa</em> may not leave him during life: but whether that living man
be a poor man or a <em>Rátu</em>, let every one seek to acquire what is permanent,
that by so doing there may be no other knowledge than that which is perceived
within the heart. A great man and rich man who is wise, must
commence with the road to knowledge, which is undeviating. Concerning
real knowledge, with all its excellencies and utilities, it is respected by
the virtuous: that real knowledge is certainly sent by the <em>Déwa</em> to
favoured men. And do you not indulge your passions, as is forbidden by
the <em>Sastra</em>; better had you preserve your heart pure, for that pure heart
will for ever be your companion. And do you not associate and communicate
with bad men, but remove to a distance from them. It is best
as much as possible, to curb pleasure and ill-timed laughter; putting a
check to them is far removed from a bad heart: the fault of a person
fond of ill-timed laughter is that he suffers pain. It is unfortunate that
man forgets such information as is worthy of being remembered, and recollects
such as is not worth remembering. In like manner, you eat food
which should not be eaten, and do not eat that which is wholesome. A
person acting thus is void of sense, and similar to a porter; although the
viands are very agreeable to you, if you load yourself with them immoderately,
the weight you carry will certainly distress your body. Moreover,
if you meet with any thing of such estimation as to be worth imitating,
do you immediately write it down, so that you thereby acquire a
good name, and men may look up to you, and to the end that the <em>Rátu</em>
may have confidence in you, because that <em>Rátu</em> can act well and ill; but
let the <em>Rátu</em> not neglect the commencement, middle, and end, for there is
nothing in the world of greater excellence than mankind; different from
the existence of a <em>Rasaksa</em>, whose actions cannot be spoken of; like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxxvi" id="Page_mmcxxxvi">[Vol II Pg cxxxvi]</a></span>
those of a fish in the sea, which no one knows except the Omnipotent,
who alone is acquainted with the truth thereof.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Translation</span> <em>of another</em> <span class="smcap">Javan Inscription</span> <em>of the same description</em>.</h3>

<p>Truly the reckoning of the year when this was composed was 1216,
named <em>Milir</em>, written on a tablet the fifth of the moon on its wane, the
mind tallying with the season, precisely in the <em>Wukun Manda Kung'an</em>.
It is a description of the <em>kraton</em> and its arrangements, put into writing in
the country of <em>Mauspati</em>, of which the chief is exalted, merciful, wise, and
discerning; at this period, the greatest in the world, and adapted to the
situation he fills and its duties; on that account, women say they are fond
of him: powerful, skilful, a sovereign whose commands to his subjects
are undisputed, unequalled in politeness, guarded by genii, and having a
large army, all-skilful in their profession when at war: the arrangements
of his troops superior, and they and their arms excellent; his army, too
celebrated. At that time those troops guarded well his country, and the
orders issued by his relations were correct. That <em>Rátu</em> never punished
his children: he was good, and did not inflict punishment on them.</p>

<p>It is related of the <em>Sri Maharája</em> that he intended going to the high
mountains: leaving his country and arriving at the declivity, the boundary
of <em>Gedung Peluk</em>, his army soon met the enemy, and engaged. So it
is related in history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That army of the <em>Sri Jaya</em> being established, the <em>Ratú</em> formerly considered
beneficial to the country, giving firmness to the country of <em>Kedíri</em>.
What the <em>Sri Jaya</em> says is certain; all the people are glad; a large and
faithful army is established there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Be cautious but firm; the <em>Sri Maharaja</em> cannot injure the descendants
of <em>Prabu</em>; great their wisdom, impatient their sway, extensive their
power. Young men fearless and bold; the army followed, and were taken
by the enemy, because the <em>Sri Nara Nata</em> so intended. <em>Sri Kerta Najura</em>,
when he died, died like a <em>Buda</em> man. Formerly, <em>Sri Jaya Katong</em> came
from <em>Gegelang</em>, and entered like a man in desperation; sent to <em>Kerta
Niaka</em> requesting assistance of foreigners, and desired them to advance in
front. <em>Sri Kerto Najara</em> went into that country, and assembled the arms
of the <em>Sri Jaya Katong</em>, with the son-in-law and brother-in-law of <em>Ng'uda
Raja</em> and the <em>Sri Nara Nata</em>. Of <em>Sri Nara Najura</em> and <em>Ng'uda Raja</em> they
were seated in the centre, their brightness shining in the halting place;
their symmetry like <em>Sura Denawa</em>, majestic as well as awfully powerful,
and their hearts at rest. Such was the truth. They were prevented by
the magic of fire; supremely powerful the <em>Sri Maharaja</em>; the enemy's
army was destroyed by fire. The <em>Yewang Derma</em> advanced and assisted
in the labours of the <em>Rátu</em>. <em>Kerta Jaya</em> was beaten and fled, his power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxxxvii" id="Page_mmcxxxvii">[Vol II Pg cxxxvii]</a></span>
destroyed, afterwards the whole army fled, and met the army of the
insurgents. A <em>Mantri</em> rallied the good army, that the <em>Mantri</em> might be
able to fight; the battle was commenced in <em>Sela Sringing</em>. The <em>Sri
Maharaja</em> coming to his ground, was firm at the foot of the mountains,
and he came to <em>Yewang Derma</em> to request food for his people and chiefs:
he got as much as he wished with an open heart. Thus may that army
continue until the end of time, until death, in the fulfilment of their
wishes.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX K.<br />

ACCOUNT OF BÁLI.</h2>


<p>To the east of Java lies the island of <em>Báli</em>. This interesting spot exhibits
the same mineralogical structure as Java, and probably at one period composed
a part of the same island. Possessing the same climate and a
similar soil, having mountains of a proportionate height, and streams
equally fitted for the purpose of irrigation, it enjoys the same degree of
fertility; but having an iron-bound coast, without harbours or good anchorage,
it has been in a great measure shut out from external commerce,
particularly with traders in large vessels.</p>

<p>Like <em>Madúra</em>, it seems naturally situated for being a tributary to Java.
But the most striking features in the character and institutions of its inhabitants
are owing to that long independence on the greater island and
its fortunes, which has preserved to them many traces of their original
condition, many of their distinctive laws and religious rites.</p>

<p>The natives of <em>Báli</em>, although of the same original stock with the
Javans, exhibit several striking differences, not only in their manners and
the degrees of civilization they have attained, but in their features and
bodily appearance. They are above the middle size of Asiatics, and exceed,
both in stature and muscular power, either the Javan or the <em>Maláyu</em>.
Though professing a religion which in western India moulds the character
of the Hindu into the most tame and implicit subserviency to rule and
authority, and though living under the rod of despotism which they have
put into the hands of their chiefs, they still possess much of the original
boldness and self-willed hardihood of the savage state.</p>

<p>Their general indifference to the oppression which they endure, their
good humour and apparent satisfaction, together with their superior animation
and energy, give to their countenances, naturally fairer and more
expressive than those of the Javans, a higher cast of spirit, independence,
and manliness, than belongs to any of their neighbours. They are active
and enterprising, and free from that listlessness and indolence which are
observable in the inhabitants of Java. To a stranger their manners appear
abrupt, unceremonious, coarse, and repulsive; but upon further acquaintance
this becomes less perceptible, and their undisguised frankness commands
reciprocal confidence and respect. Their women, in particular,
who are here on a perfect equality with the men, and not required to perform
many of the severe and degrading labours imposed upon them in
Java, are frank and unreserved. In their domestic relations their manners
are amiable, respectful, and decorous. The female character, indeed,
seems to have acquired among them more relative dignity and esteem than
it could have been expected to have attained where polygamy has been
long established.

<p>The conduct of parents to their children is mild and gentle, and it is
requited by unreserved docility and obedience. To their chiefs they show
a respectful deference: among themselves they stand on a footing of
equality, and feeling no dependence pay little homage. The abject servitude
of Asia has not proceeded further with them than necessary obedience
to indispensable authority. Their prince is sacred in their eyes,
and meets with unreserved obedience; but their minds are not broken
down by numerous demands on their submission, nor are their manners
polished by the habit of being frequently with superiors. An European
or a native, therefore, who has been accustomed to the polite and elegant
manners of the Javans, or with the general courtesy of the Malayus, is
struck with the unceremonious, rude, and uncivilized habits of the people
of <em>Báli</em>.</p>

<p>In the arts they are considerably behind the Javans, though they seem
capable of advancing rapidly. They are happily not subjected to a frame
of government so calculated to repress their energies, or to waste their
resources. They are now a rising people. Neither degraded by despotism
nor enervated by habits of indolence or luxury, they perhaps promise
fairer for a progress in civilization and good government than any of their
neighbours.</p>

<p>They are strangers to the vices of drunkenness, libertinism, and conjugal
infidelity: their predominant passions are gaming and cock fighting.
In these amusements, when at peace with the neighbouring states, all the
vehemence and energy of their character and spirit is called forth and exhausted.
Their energy, their modes of life, and their love of independence,
render them formidable to the weaker states in their neighbourhood,
and secure them against all attacks from any native power in the
Indian Archipelago. What they now are it is probable that the Javans
once were, in national independence, as well as in religious and political
institutions.</p>

<p>The island of <em>Báli</em> appears to be divided at present into seven different
states, each independent of the other, and subject to its own chief.</p>

<p>The population of these states is estimated to amount in all to above
eight hundred thousand souls. This estimate is formed from the numbers
of males whose teeth have been filed, which in the different states stood
in round numbers as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

</table><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxl" id="Page_mmcxl">[Vol II Pg cxl]</a></span></div>

<p>As the operation of filing the teeth immediately precedes puberty, this
list of course excludes all males who have not arrived at that period, as
well as all females whatever. From the early age at which marriages are
contracted, those who have undergone the operation may for the most
part be considered as having entered into family connections<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>, and a
calculation of four to a family will give the same result. This great
population has doubtless increased since the abolition of the slave trade.</p>

<p>Of this heptarchy, <em>Klóngkong</em> is admitted to be the most ancient sovereignty.
Its princes are said to have originally emigrated from Java, and
a period is recorded when the whole island of <em>Báli</em> acknowledged their
authority. Even still they retain evidences of their former dignity, and
traces of their former influence. Among the regalia are still preserved a
<em>kris</em>, and other articles that belonged to <em>Majapáhit</em>, and the other princes
of the island recognize them as the stock from whence they sprung,
though they limit their fealty to general respect, and jealously maintain
their own independence.</p>

<p><em>Báli</em> is generally supposed to have been originally peopled from different
parts of Celebes. The first person who is said to have established the
religion and government which still exist, was <em>Déwa Agung Kátut</em>, son of
<em>Rátu Browijáya</em> of <em>Majapáhit</em> in Java. The cause of his quitting Java is
related by the Balians as follows.</p>

<p>"The father of <em>Browijáya</em> was informed by his head <em>Bramána</em>, that it
was written in a sacred book that after the expiration of forty days the
title of <em>Rája</em> of <em>Majapáhit</em> should be extinct: to which the Raja gave
such implicit credit, that at the expiration of that time he caused himself
to be burnt alive. His son, not daring to disobey the sentence of the
book, removed to <em>Báli</em> with a number of followers, and established his
authority at <em>Klóngkong</em>, taking the title of supreme sovereign, which
title still continues hereditary in the Rajas of <em>Klóngkong</em>."</p>

<p>The inhabitants of <em>Báli</em>, like those of Java, are principally employed in
agriculture. The fertility of the island may be inferred from the number
of people maintained on so limited a spot. Rice is the chief produce of
the soil, and of course the chief article of subsistence.</p>

<p>From the mountainous nature of the country, advantage cannot so
easily be taken of the periodical rains for the purpose of the rice irrigation,
but the lands are irrigated by an abundant supply of water from
streams and rivers. In some places, as in <em>Kárang Asem</em>, two crops of rice
are obtained in one year; but over the greatest part of the island only
one. In the dry season the <em>sáwahs</em> yield a crop of maize. The natives
reckon from fifty to sixty fold of increase in the rice cultivation no
extraordinary produce. The women are not employed, as in Java, to
plant the <em>pári</em>: their assistance in the field is only required to reap it.
The implements of husbandry are of the same simple construction as
those on Java, and nearly similar in form.</p>

<p>Bullocks of the <em>Bánteng</em>, or wild breed, and of very fine quality, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxli" id="Page_mmcxli">[Vol II Pg cxli]</a></span>
almost invariably used in husbandry. The price of a pair of oxen of this
kind, fit for the plough, is generally about six Spanish dollars, and seldom
exceeds eight. The ordinary price of a <em>pikul</em> (133¼ pounds English) of
rice, is about three-fourths of a Spanish dollar.</p>

<p>The tenure by which land is held differs widely from that which exists
at present in the native provinces of Java. The sovereign is not here
considered the universal landlord; on the contrary, the soil is almost
invariably considered as the private property of the subject, in whatever
manner it is cultivated or divided. It may be sold, let, pledged, devised,
or otherwise disposed of, at the option of the proprietor, and without any
reference to the will of the superior. The divisions of this property are
generally very minute, and the mode of measurement not very defined,
and there are instances of great irregularity, even in the application of
the same mode of measurement.</p>

<p>The measure of land is expressed by the quantity of seed required to
sow it, and said to be so many <em>tánas</em>. Some proprietors possess fifty
<em>tánas</em>, while others hold not more than one or two. The private estate of
the elder Raja of <em>Bliling</em> did not exceed a few hundred <em>tánas</em>, nor did that
of the younger much surpass it.</p>

<p>But though the prince is not considered as actual proprietor of the land
of his dominions, he receives a certain share of the produce in the way of
tax. This tax is either paid in a small Chinese coin, called <em>képeng</em>, or in
kind, at the rate of about five <em>tánas</em> of produce for every <em>tána</em> of seed
sown.</p>

<p>Though in the lower districts the food of the people is universally rice,
in the higher and more mountainous parts they subsist principally on sweet
potatoes and Indian corn. The principal animal food that they use is
swine flesh, which is found in great abundance. The price of a grown
hog seldom exceeds a dollar, and scarcely ever amounts to a dollar and
a half.</p>

<p>The habitations of the Bálians differ from those of the Javans, in being
generally constructed of mud walls and surrounded by walls of baked or
unbaked bricks; in consequence of which, and the peculiar formation of
the entrances and doorways, the principal towns are said to resemble the
Hindu towns on the continent of India.</p>

<p>The arts are little practised. Though the island produces cotton of
the most excellent quality, and in great abundance, the natives have not
generally learned the art of painting or printing the cloth, which they
manufacture from it. The women here, as on Java, are the manufacturers
of all the cloth used by their husbands or families. Their principal
manufacture is in <em>kríses</em> and warlike instruments; they make fire-arms,
and ornament the barrels, but purchase European locks.</p>

<p>The principal exports are rice, birds'-nests, coarse cloths, cotton yarn,
salted eggs, <em>dínding</em>, <em>gámbir</em>, and oil: the principal imports are opium
(which the inhabitants are unfortunately much addicted to), <em>káyu pélet</em>,
betel-nut, ivory, gold, and silver. The Bálians dislike a seafaring life,
and hold the profession of a merchant in disrepute. Their fairs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxlii" id="Page_mmcxlii">[Vol II Pg cxlii]</a></span>
markets are few and little frequented. The trade that was at one time
carried on with the greatest success was the traffic in slaves. The usual
price of a male slave was from ten to thirty dollars, of a female from fifty
to one hundred. This disgraceful traffic, it may be hoped, will soon
be entirely annihilated. While it existed in its full vigour, all prisoners
taken in war, all who attempted to evade the laws by emigration, all insolvent
debtors, and a certain class of thieves, were subjected to the sad condition
of slavery. These laws still subsist, and are enforced, as formerly,
for the purpose of procuring the home supply; but the diminution of the
foreign demand must limit exceedingly their exercise, and in a short time
ameliorate the state of the unhappy individuals who had suffered by them<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.</p>

<p>But the most interesting character of the Bálians arises out of the
frame of their government, the code of their laws, and the system of their
religion. I have, in one part of this work, particularly described, and in
others repeatedly alluded to, the traces of Hinduism on Java; and if these
traces had not been decided and manifest in themselves, their interpretation
would have been rendered manifest by what occurs in Báli.</p>

<p>In Báli not more than one in two hundred, if so many, are Mahomedans,
and the great body of the people profess the creed and observe
the institutions of a religion which has become extinct in the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxliii" id="Page_mmcxliii">[Vol II Pg cxliii]</a></span>Archipelago. On Java we find Hinduism only amid the ruins of temples,
images, and inscriptions; on <em>Báli</em>, in the laws, ideas, and worship of the
people. On Java this singular and interesting system of religion is
classed among the antiquities of the island. Here it is a living source of
action, and a universal rule of conduct. The present state of <em>Báli</em> may
be considered, therefore, as a kind of commentary on the ancient condition
of the natives of Java. Hinduism has here severed society into
casts; it has introduced its divinities; it has extended its ceremonies into
most of the transactions of life; it has enjoined or recommended some of
its severest sacrifices, such as the burning of a widow on the funeral pile
of her husband: but yet the individual retains all the native manliness of
his character and all the fire of the savage state.</p>

<p>By this system the Bálians are divided into four casts: 1. The <em>Bramána</em>,
2. <em>Rusi</em> or <em>Satria</em>, 3. <em>Wisia</em>, and 4. <em>Sudra</em>. The princes of the island are
generally, but not always, of the <em>Bramána</em> cast: the present Raja of
<em>Bliling</em> is of the second class. The government is despotic, there being
no check on the will of the chief nor any sharer of his power<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>. He is
assisted in his internal administration by a head <em>Parbákal</em>; and in the
general affairs of his government, the management of foreign correspondence,
and the superintendence of his foreign relations, by an officer
called <em>Ráden Tumúng'gung</em>.</p>

<p>The system of village government is established here as on Java. The
constitution of each village is the same. The head, or chief, is termed
<em>Parbákal</em>, and the assistant <em>Kalían Témpek</em>: these officers are invariably
selected from among the people of the village which they are appointed to
govern. The office of <em>Parbákal</em> is considered hereditary, if the successor
is competent; and on a vacancy occurring, the <em>Parbákal</em> recommends the
successor of a <em>Kalían Témpek</em>.</p>

<p>Under the head <em>Parbákal</em>, who is termed <em>Parbákal Rája</em>, are several
inferior <em>Parbákals</em>, as assistants to that officer in conveying his orders
to the heads of villages; and under the <em>Ráden Tumúng'gung</em> is placed
a similar establishment, consisting of about a hundred persons, with the
rank and title of <em>Kalían Témpek</em>.</p>

<p>Many of the <em>Parbákals</em> of villages in <em>Bliling</em> have the title of <em>Gústi</em>,
which descends in their families, and which serves to distinguish them as
nobles. These probably originated in their conduct in war. The command
of the military is at present vested in a chief of the <em>Bramána</em> cast,
styled <em>Rája Bángen Senapáti</em>; <em>Bángen</em> being the district which contains
the principal Braminical establishment. He seems to receive honours and
respect next to the Rajah himself.</p>

<p>The heads of <em>kampongs</em> in which foreigners reside are termed <em>Pang'gáwa</em>;
and in speaking collectively of the heads of villages, the Raja uses
the term <em>Papang'gáwa</em>.</p>

<p>The administration of justice is generally conducted by a court, composed
of one <em>Jáksa</em> and two assistants: in addition to whom, in the determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxliv" id="Page_mmcxliv">[Vol II Pg cxliv]</a></span>
of any cause of importance, several <em>Bramánas</em> are called in.
Their decisions are guided by written laws. The civil code is called
<em>Degáma</em>, the criminal code <em>Agáma</em>. Before these courts three or four witnesses
are required to substantiate any criminal charge. Their witnesses
are examined on oath, and people of any cast are competent to take
such oath and to be so examined. The form of administering the oath
requires of the person who takes it to hold a bason of water in his hand,
and after repeating, "may I and my whole generation perish, if what I
allege is not true," to drink the water.</p>

<p>The form of procedure requires the prosecutor or plaintiff to be heard
first on oath: his witnesses are next examined, then the prisoner or defendant
and his witnesses, after which the court decides on a general view of
the whole of the evidence submitted to its consideration. No torture is
employed to procure evidence: mutilation is unknown. The usual punishments
are death, confinement, and servitude. The laws, in some instances,
are severe, in others lenient. In the execution of the punishment
awarded by the court there is this peculiarity, that the aggrieved party or
his friends, are appointed to inflict it: for though the judge steps in between
the prosecutor and person whom he pursues, so as to restrain the indiscriminate
animosity of the one and to determine the criminality of the other,
the Bálians have not advanced so far in the refinement of criminal justice,
as to consider criminal offences in the nature of offences perpetrated against
the state, and punishable by its officers.</p>

<p>Theft and robbery are punished by death inflicted by a <em>krís</em>; murder and
treason are punished in some cases by breaking the limbs of the convict
with a hatchet, and leaving him to linger some days in agony till death ensues.
Adultery is punished with death in the man and perpetual servitude
to the prince in the woman. This severity restrains the crime; but in the
small state of <em>Bliling</em> there occur sometimes several trials for it during the
year.</p>

<p>The Raja must confirm every criminal sentence before it is executed, and
every civil decision that involves the servitude of the party. Confiscation
of the culprit's property follows capital punishment only, the amount of
which is divided between the prince and judges. In other cases there is
no confiscation.</p>

<p>The laws of <em>Báli</em> differ from those of Java with respect to marriages
and divorces. In the former island, divorces are permitted under no
circumstances whatever; in the latter, almost every caprice is sufficient
to procure one. In <em>Báli</em> the husband generally buys his wife by paying
a sum of money to her parents: thirty dollars is the common price. If
unable to pay this sum, he becomes, as in the patriarchal times of scripture,
the servant of the party to whom he thus becomes indebted, and resides
along with his wife in the house of his father-in-law. His services
are received in diminution of the dowry; and if he acts so as to please the
family of his wife, the exaction of it is either in part or in whole remitted.</p>

<p>Without entering into any theory concerning the history of the religious
system of <em>Báli</em>, or any detailed comparison of it with systems in India, the
following notices may be thought interesting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxlv" id="Page_mmcxlv">[Vol II Pg cxlv]</a></span></p>

<p>The inhabitants, as before stated, are divided into casts, named <em>Bramána</em>,
<em>Sátria</em>, <em>Wísia</em>, and <em>Súdra</em>. The <em>Bramánas</em> are of two descriptions, <em>Bramána
Séwa</em> and <em>Bramána Búda</em>. The former are most respected, and refrain
from eating all animal food, except that of ducks, goats, and buffaloes:
hogs' flesh and that of the cow are forbidden. The <em>Bramána Búda</em>
eat indiscriminately of animal food.</p>

<p>The <em>Bramána Séwa</em> are said not to perform worship in the temples: this
is left to the lowest orders, generally the <em>Súdras</em>. The worship of the lower
orders, as performed in the temples, cannot be called Hindu. In these
temples, which are very numerous, mud figures are placed, representing
the tutelar deities of each particular country.</p>

<p>The <em>Bramánas</em> of all descriptions are held in great respect, and never condescend
to pay compliments to any person whatever. The respect in which
they are relatively held, seems to be in proportion to the age of the
person, and his supposed learning and accomplishments. A <em>Bramána</em> may
eat from the hands of another of a similar age, but not from those of a
junior.</p>

<p>The <em>Bramána</em> are said not to worship idols, nor do they perform public
worship in the temples, but in their private houses only.</p>

<p>A <em>Bramána</em> may marry a woman of an inferior order, but the offspring
of such a marriage is called <em>Bujánga</em>, which forms a distinct class.</p>

<p>There is in <em>Báli</em> a class of outcasts, called <em>Chandálas</em>, who are not permitted
to reside in villages; are generally potters, dyers, dealers in leather,
distillers, and retailers of ardent spirits. The dancing women are of the
<em>Wisia</em> and <em>Sudra</em> castes.</p>

<p>A <em>Bramána</em> cannot be in any servile occupation. He cannot sit on the
ground, nor perform obeisance to any other class.</p>

<p>The religion of <em>Báli</em> has been considered as of two descriptions, that of
<em>Budh</em> and that of <em>Bráma</em>. The Budhists are said to have come first to the
country. Of the <em>Bramánas</em> of <em>Séwa</em> nine generations are said to have passed
over since their arrival. The name of the principal <em>Bramána</em> of the caste of
<em>Séwa</em>, who first settled on <em>Báli</em>, is said to have been <em>Wútu Ráhu</em>: he came
from <em>Telingána</em>, and on his way is said to have touched at <em>Majapáhit</em>.</p>

<p>The Rajas of <em>Báli</em> are generally of the <em>Satria</em> caste; but this does not
always hold.</p>

<p>From information obtained at <em>Bliling</em>, it would appear that the greater
part of the population of <em>Báli</em> follow the worship of <em>Séwa</em>. The Budhists
are said to be rare, and the names of three districts only could be stated,
where the Budhist religion is supposed to prevail.</p>

<p>The sacrifice of the widow on the funeral pile of her husband is frequent.
All classes may perform this sacrifice, but it is most common with the
<em>Satría</em>. Force is said never to be had recourse to on these occasions. The
number of women who sacrifice themselves is extraordinary:​&mdash;the father
of the present Raja of <em>Bliling</em> was followed by no less than seventy-four
women. The dead body is usually preserved in these cases for many
months, and even for a year. The corpse is preserved by daily fumigations
with <em>benzoin</em>.</p>

<p>The bodies of the dead are burnt, except in the case of children before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxlvi" id="Page_mmcxlvi">[Vol II Pg cxlvi]</a></span>
they have shed their teeth, and of all persons dying of the small pox: as
in the latter case the body cannot be preserved, and it is usual, even with
the lower orders, to keep the body for two months. Among some, however,
it is said to be usual to throw the dead bodies into the sea.</p>

<p>The flesh of the cow is eaten by all except the <em>Bramánas</em> who have led a
life of austerity: these refrain from eating even rice, and live wholly upon
roots and fruit.</p>

<p>The Budhists are said to be so little scrupulous in their diet, as to eat
not only the flesh of the cow, but even that of dogs and all other animals.
Milk is never used as an article of food.</p>

<p>These particulars respecting the religious observances of the Bálians were
obligingly communicated to me by Mr. Crawfurd, who visited the island in
1814. In the following year I visited <em>Bliling</em> myself; but my stay was too
short to obtain any very detailed information on this interesting particular,
further than a collection of their different manuscripts, which have been
brought to this country, and already adverted to under the head of Javan
literature.</p>

<p>On inquiring into the rank of their deities, they replied at once:</p>


<ul><li>The first is <em>Batára Gúru</em>.</li>
<li>The second <em>Batára Bráma</em>, emblematical of fire.</li>
<li>The third <em>Batára Wísnu</em>, emblematical of water.</li>
<li>The fourth <em>Batára Séwa</em>, emblematical of air.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides these they have several other deities, not however termed <em>Batára</em>,
as:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><em>Déwa Géde Segara</em>, the deity of the sea.</p>

<p><em>Déwa Géde Dálam</em>, emblematical of death.</p>

<p><em>Déwa Géde Báli Agung</em>, the deity in whose temple (which is
near the <em>kadaton</em> of the Raja), the common people on particular
days pay worship.</p>

<p><em>Déwa Géde Gúnung Agung</em>, a deity still more generally worshipped,
and to whom all the Rajas and people of <em>Báli</em> pay
adoration.</p></div>

<p>The deity <em>Mahadéwa</em> is known and mentioned in the religious books, but
is not an object of worship.</p>

<p><em>Batára Gúru</em> is considered as the highest object of worship below the divinity.
<em>Sang yang Túng'gal</em> (the <em>Lord who is one</em>).</p>

<p>I shall close this account of the religion of <em>Báli</em> with the following literal
translation of an account of the Hindu religion, furnished to me by an
intelligent Mahomedan, a native of the island.</p>

<p>"The religion of <em>Búdh</em>, as it exists on <em>Báli</em>, is divided into <em>Sakálan</em> and
<em>Niskálan</em>. The first regards all worldly concerns, such as the orders of
the prince, the laws of the land, &amp;c., including the common affairs and
transactions of life; the second comprehends all the duties and ceremonies
of religion, the conducting of which is in the hands of the <em>Maperwíta</em>,
or learned Brahmins called <em>Padénda</em>.</p>

<p>"The different kinds of worship attached to this division of the religion,
are those of <em>Batára Permisti Gúru</em>, <em>Batara Naráda</em>, <em>Batara Sang yang
Túng'gal</em>, and all his descendants; of all of whom images are made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxlvii" id="Page_mmcxlvii">[Vol II Pg cxlvii]</a></span>
some of gold, some of silver, some of bell-metal, and some in iron; and
to whom are dedicated temples and places for the reception of their images
on <em>Gúnung Agung</em>, <em>Gúnug Bátu</em>, <em>Gúnung Baturkahu</em>, and <em>Gúnung Predung</em>;
but it is <em>Gúnung Agung</em> that is the famous place for them; and those
figures are the objects of worship to all the princes of <em>Báli</em>.</p>

<p>"When there happens to be a <em>mabántan</em>, which signifies a festival on
some grand occasion, all the Rajas, with their families, descendants, and
subjects, repair to <em>Gúnung Agung</em> and invoke all the deities, the <em>Maperwíta
Bramána</em> being summoned to attend and conduct the ceremonies.</p>

<p>"On occasions of less importance, those images only of the deities
which are behind their houses are worshipped, a <em>Maperwíta Bramána</em>
being called to attend and officiate.</p>

<p>"At the <em>Pembákaran</em>, or place where the bodies of the princes are
burned, there are also figures of the different deities, in places made for
their reception.</p>

<p>"Marriages (<em>mabandángan</em>) are sanctified by their being borne witness
to by the <em>Maperwíta Bramánas</em>, as well as all the deities who are invoked
on the occasion.</p>

<p>"On the new moon, and on the eighth and twenty-third of the month
all the deities are worshipped, every one joining in the ceremonies.
Should any of the Rajas attend on those days, he of the greatest rank,
and power orders the attendance of the <em>Maperwíta Bramánas</em>. Great
offerings being made to the deities, thousands of people are afterwards
fed with their consecrated fragments. On these occasions the <em>Maperwíta
Bramána</em>, called <em>Padénda</em>, administers to the people holy water,
which they both drink and perform ablutions with.</p>

<p>"On the day of the new year, the deities are worshipped, ablutions
performed, and offerings made. Cloths and money, &amp;c. are offered twice
a year, <em>Bramána Padénda</em> attending and invoking the deities.</p>

<p>"On the day <em>támpak klíwon</em>, the <em>Bramána Padénda</em> performs prayers,
using holy water.</p>

<p>"When it is <em>támpak wáyang</em>, which means the new year <em>wáyangs</em>, offerings
are made and placed at all the outer doors, but no worshipping
takes place.</p>

<p>"At the annual festivals of <em>támpuk kándang</em>, there are offerings made on
account of all the different animals.</p>

<p>"There is also the fast of <em>Nyualátu</em>, which lasts a day and a night,

some curiosity, as being the first individual of the woolly haired race of Eastern Asia who has
been brought to this country. It is known, that on the Malayan Peninsula, in Luconia, Borneo,
and most of the larger islands of the Eastern Seas, there are occasionally found in the mountainous
tracts a scattered race of blacks entirely distinct from the rest of the population. Some have conceived
them to be the aborigines of these countries; others considering them as of the African
race, adduce them in proof of an early and extensive intercourse between Africa and these
islands. I shall content myself with observing, that they appear at the present day to form the
bulk of the population of Papua or New Guinea. The following remarks upon the individual
now in England, whom we sometimes call Papua, and sometimes (more to his satisfaction) Dick,
were obligingly communicated to me by Sir Everard Home, Bart.
</p>
<p>
"The Papuan differs from the African negro in the following particulars. His skin is of a
lighter colour, the woolly hair grows in small tufts, and each hair has a spiral twist. The forehead
rises higher, and the hind head is not so much cut off. The nose projects more from the
face. The upper lip is longer and more prominent. The lower lip projects forward from the
lower jaw to such an extent that the chin forms no part of the face, the lower part of which is
formed by the mouth. The buttocks are so much lower than in the negro as to form a striking
mark of distinction, but the calf of the leg is as high as in the negro."</p></div>

of Papua by Don Jorge de Meneges (about the year 1528 or 1533) who, in a calm was hurried by a
strong current with extraordinary rapidity to the eastward, until he arrived at a country inhabited
by a race as black as negroes, or the natives of the southern coast of Africa, from the Cape
of Good Hope to Mosambique; they visited the king on shore, who was as black as the others.

<p>
The monsoon detained Meneges here some months, during which time he had a friendly intercourse
with the natives, who became very familiar, supplying him in barter with what he wanted;
but they informed him that in the interior there were men who eat human flesh.

<p>
"Here," says he, "our people saw both men and women as white and as fair as Germans, and
on asking how those people were called, they answered 'Papuas,' and on account of the little
knowledge which we had at that time of the country, we concluded that they were islands.
But from what we afterwards understood, this must be the country which Marco Polo, the
Venetian, calls Lechac, and which he says is very rich in gold."

<h2>APPENDIX L.<br />

<em><span class="smcap">Proclamation</span>, declaring the <span class="smcap">Principles</span> of the <span class="smcap">Intended Change</span> of
<span class="smcap">System</span>.</em></h2>


<p>The Right Honourable Lord Minto, previous to his departure from Java,
having adverted to the general system of the administration, and of the
internal management established under the former government of this
island, was pleased to suggest and recommend such improvements, as
upon correct information, and an adequate knowledge of the state of
society amongst the native inhabitants, might be deemed conducive to
the advancement of individual happiness and of public prosperity.</p>

<p>With a view to promote so desirable an event, the Honourable the
Lieutenant-Governor in Council nominated a Committee, of which Lieutenant-Colonel
Colin Mackenzie was president, who, with the zeal,
talent, and industrious research which characterize that officer, obtained,
with the aid of the members of the Committee, authentic statistical
accounts of this island; while the fund of valuable information, thus
acquired, has been increased from other respectable channels of communication.</p>

<p>The Honourable the Lieutenant-Governor in Council has, therefore,
after the most mature consideration, deemed it advisable to establish an
improved system of political economy throughout this island, with the
intention of ameliorating the condition of all its inhabitants, by affording
that protection to individual industry, which will insure to every class of
society the equitable and undisturbed enjoyment of the fruits of labour;
and while it is confidently expected that private happiness and public prosperity
will be advanced under this change of system, such alterations and
amendments will be hereafter adopted, as experience may suggest, or the
improving habits and manners of the body of the people may seem to
require.</p>

<p>The following principles form the basis of the new arrangements, and
are made public for general information.</p>

<p>1. The undue influence and authority of the native chiefs have been
restricted: but government will avail themselves of their services in the
important department of the native police, which will be arranged upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcxlix" id="Page_mmcxlix">[Vol II Pg cxlix]</a></span>
fixed principles, adapted to the habits and original institutions of the
people. A competent provision in lands and in money has been allotted to
such chiefs, and it therefore naturally becomes both their duty and their
interest, to encourage industry and to protect the inhabitants.</p>

<p>2. The government lands will be let generally to the heads of villages,
who will be held responsible for the proper management of such portions
of the country as may be placed under their superintendence and authority.
They will re-let these lands to the cultivators, under certain restrictions,
at such a rate as shall not be found oppressive; and all tenants
under government will be protected in their just rights, so long as they
shall continue to perform their correspondent engagements faithfully;
for it is intended to promote extensive industry and consequent improvement,
by giving the people an interest in the soil, and by instituting
amongst them an acknowledged claim to the possession of the lands, that
they may be thus induced to labour for their own profit and advantage.</p>

<p>3. The system of vassalage and forced deliveries has been abolished
generally throughout the island: but in the Batavian and Preangen Regencies
such a modification of the former arrangements has been carried
into execution, as it was found practicable, under existing circumstances,
to introduce; and provisionally the Blandong system will be continued to
a certain extent in the central Forest Districts.</p>

<p>4. To encourage the cultivation of so important an article of export as
coffee may become, when the trade of Europe and America may be
thrown open to free competition, government have stipulated to receive
any surplus quantity of that commodity from the cultivators, at a reasonable
and fixed rate, when a higher price for it cannot be obtained in the
market.</p>

<p>5. To extend free trade and commerce, and to promote a spirit of enterprise
and speculation amongst the inhabitants, the Bhoom farms have
been abolished, the duties upon the principal articles of export have been
taken off, and it is intended to modify and amend the custom-house regulations
before the 1st January next. The toll-gates and transport duties
of the interior have been diminished as much as possible, and in the gradual
progression of improvement they will be finally abolished.</p>

<p>6. Every facility will be afforded towards obtaining teak timber for the
construction of small craft, and of such additional tonnage as, upon the
improved system, will be undoubtedly required.</p>

<p>7. Government have taken upon themselves the exclusive management
of the salt department. It appears, that the inhabitants in most parts of
the island paid a very irregular and exorbitant price for this necessary
article of consumption; while the system adopted by the farmers was
radically vicious, and equally oppressive and vexatious to the people, as it
was detrimental to the immediate interests of government.</p>

<p>Such an improved system for the supply of salt will be immediately
adopted, as may appear advisable; and in this and every other arrangement,
the government propose the advancement of the interests and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcl" id="Page_mmcl">[Vol II Pg cl]</a></span>
happiness of the people at large, and the promotion of the public prosperity
of this colony.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX L. No. II.<br />

REVENUE INSTRUCTIONS.</h3>

<p>The Honourable the Lieutenant-Governor in Council having taken into
mature consideration the state of the Land Revenue of this Island, and
being impressed with the necessity of establishing one uniform, equitable,
and adequate system for its assessment and realization, has been pleased
to direct that the following instructions be sent to the Residents, Collectors,
and other officers, to whom are consigned the charge of the
several provinces under his authority.</p>

<p>1. It is the object of government to separate, in a great measure, the
revenue from the judicial branches of the internal administration, it
being deemed that a more lucid and simple arrangement of the public
business will be formed thereby; and that the relieving the residents
from a part of their at present too extensive and complicated duties, will
ensure so much easier and better execution of the remainder, as fully to
counterbalance any additional expense that may be incurred by the adoption
of the measure.</p>

<p>2. For this purpose it has been resolved, that collectors shall be appointed
immediately to the various districts, whose office shall consist in
the sole and entire superintendance of the land revenue, and to whom
therefore shall be made over by the Residents the complete charge of that
department, with all such papers, documents, &amp;c. as are in any way connected
with it.</p>

<p>3. In some instances, however, from strong local, political, or other
reasons, it is considered advisable, that several branches of the public
duty remain still vested for a time in the Resident alone. As this necessity
shall cease, care will be taken, by the introduction of separate collectors,
to attain uniformity. But, in the mean time, it is particularly enjoined to
such Residents as are continued in this double capacity of revenue and
judicial superintendants, to take due care that these several branches be
not blended in the execution, but that each part of their duty be discharged
according to the department to which it belongs, and that their
several proceedings be recorded in their proper departments only, distinct
from all others.</p>

<p>4. A similar line of conduct will be observed in the maintenance of the
establishments necessary for carrying on the business of these several
departments; these establishments being kept as much apart, and as
much confined to their distinct details, when the duties of collector and
judge and magistrate are exercised by the same person, as when there are
different officers appointed for the superintendance of each.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclii" id="Page_mmclii">[Vol II Pg clii]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Those Residents, therefore, to whom will still be entrusted the collection
of the land revenue, will consider the following instructions to
collectors as addressed to themselves in that capacity. Each collector
shall forward to government a list of such establishment (with the salaries
to each individual that he would recommend) as he deems adequate to
carrying on the business in his head office, where the general papers,
accounts, &amp;c. will be prepared, and which will be conducted under his
own immediate inspection.</p>

<p>6. This establishment may consist of one native assistant and such
number of writers (Javans and English) opasses, and other servants, as
may be necessary. This native assistant ought to be a man of rank,
respectability, and information, that he may be at once competent, by his
knowledge of the manners, characters, and habits of the native inhabitants,
to assist the collector in advising measures best suited to each
occasion, and by the estimation in which he is held by the people, to lend
a considerable aid in carrying those measures duly into execution.</p>

<p>7. His salary may amount to from one to two hundred rupees per
month, or a quantity of land equal to such sum may be allowed him rent
free.</p>

<p>8. It may be advisable to employ for this situation some of the Bopatis,
Patehs, or Tumunggungs, who have been, but are not now, in the actual
service of government. This, as salaries or pensions are, in many instances,
already allowed in the manner of sinecures, may prove a considerable
saving to government; and, at the same time, the having a duty
annexed to their present receipts, which will carry with it a considerable
degree of authority and consequence, may be more pleasing to many, than
the idle enjoyment of a sum of money, for which they must feel that they
are at present making no adequate return.</p>

<p>9. For the outer establishments, those necessary for carrying on the
details in each village or division, it is not intended to create any new
officers; those at present entertained, and who have as yet very well executed
the double duties of police and revenue, being deemed the most
competent and best fitted for continuing to manage the business of these
several departments.</p>

<p>10. It is not the additional expense which would arise from the appointing
a new description of revenue officers, that is alone considered in
this arrangement. The formation of a distinct revenue establishment
throughout the interior is, on many other accounts, deemed an innovation
that would be attended with considerable trouble, that would prove less
pleasing to the inhabitants themselves, and that would not be nearly so
adequate to the management of the collections, as the collection of the
combined establishment at present existing.</p>

<p>11. The head inhabitant of a Javan village has, from immemorial usage,
been considered to have vested in him the general superintendance of the
affairs relating to that village, whether in attending to the police, settling
the minor disputes that occur within its limits, or of collecting its
revenues, or more often its services. For this purpose, his office has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcliii" id="Page_mmcliii">[Vol II Pg cliii]</a></span>
elective, and the powers he exercises entrusted to him by his fellow
inhabitants.</p>

<p>12. A writer, priest, and other subordinate officers and servants, completed
its regular establishment. From harassing wars, long oppression,
feudal tyranny, and European innovation, it is true that, in many parts of
the country, scarcely a vestige remains of that species of constitution;
but it is universally acknowledged that such was once its pure form
throughout the island, and such is it still existing in many places.</p>

<p>13. This simple mode of village administration Government cannot but
admire and entirely approve of; and deeming it at once the best suited to
the genius of the people, and as promising to be the most conducive to
the interest of the ruling power, they have resolved that such system
shall be acknowledged and encouraged, by every means in their power,
throughout the provinces under their authority.</p>

<p>14. The head inhabitant therefore (whether recognized under the
name of the Petingi, Bukul, Lura, Kuwu, Mandor, or otherwise), according
to the custom of the country, shall have entrusted to him the management
of the revenue concerns of his village; a duty which his personal
influence, and minutely intimate acquaintance with the situations and
concerns of the several inhabitants of it, will render him better than any
other qualified to discharge. He shall furnish such accounts and statements
as he may from time to time be required to do; and shall obey
such orders as he may receive directly from the collector or his assistant,
or from the officer of the division in which his village is situated.</p>

<p>15. These officers of division shall likewise be continued in the double
capacity of superintending both the judicial and the revenue proceedings
within the limits of their official range. This practice, indeed, is consonant
with the immemorial customs of the country, and deemed most
calculated to render benefit in the conduct of either department.</p>

<p>16. By the judicial regulation lately enacted, the officer of division has
been empowered to settle such minor disputes as may be considered
as belonging to the revenue branch, such as the determining contested
boundaries, trespass, irregularity in the dispositions for irrigation, &amp;c.
and by extending this authority so as to empower him to take regular
cognizance of all transactions respecting revenue collections, and to inspect
whenever he pleases the several village accounts, it is deemed that
his office will become one of very great utility; serving, in future, by its
records, to refer to on every occasion, when it may be wished to ascertain
the precise nature of any permanent property or local usage within
the division.</p>

<p>17. To them, therefore, shall be considered in every way subordinate
the heads of villages; and it is trusted that they will prove a most useful
check on them.</p>

<p>18. The officers of division shall furnish to the collector all such papers
as may be required, and shall diligently execute any orders that they may
receive, either from him or from his native assistant.</p>

<p>19. Respecting the salaries for these inferior servants of government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmcliv" id="Page_mmcliv">[Vol II Pg cliv]</a></span>
they have already been in most instances fixed; certain allotments of land,
rent free, or sums of money monthly, being given to them.</p>

<p>20. The money salaries of those servants who are connected with the
Resident, shall be continued to be paid by him as they are at present.</p>

<p>21. The allotments of land shall fall under the collector's superintendance,
and he shall set down among the charges of collection, sums of
money equal to what would be the monied rent of those lands were they
not free. For this purpose, they shall be assessed, and regularly entered
among the other lands in the general lease of the village: but the collection
of this assessed rent shall not be actually made; it shall only appear
in the accounts, as that it had been realized, and paid to the several officers.</p>

<p>22. For the other officers attached to the collector, namely, those in
his head office, some it is concluded will be paid by portions of land
being made over to them, others by monthly sums of money. The
accounts of the former will be settled as already mentioned. The salaries
of the latter will be drawn for by bills on the Resident, who will continue
to be the sole treasurer of the district.</p>

<p>23. The collector will accordingly forward to him the several sums of
money he may receive in his collections, whenever they amount to five
hundred rupees.</p>

<p>24. It is trusted that the placing the heads of villages and officers of
divisions, in some measure, under two authorities, to whom they must
separately report, will not be attended with any eventual evil or confusion.
When these arrangements become well matured, and the exact limits of
their several duties clearly defined, the subordinate officers will not find
any difficulty in their execution. For the attainment of this desirable end,
however, much must depend upon the conduct of the Resident and collector.
They are placed in these districts, not as persons who are to
serve in any way as checks upon each other, but who are required to act
together for the general good; mutually to assist each other to the extent
of their power, and by preserving between themselves a good understanding,
to carry on better their respective duties.</p>

<p>25. Should, in any case, a disagreement of opinion arise on any subject
between them, a reference will be immediately made to the Honourable
the Lieutenant-Governor, who will without delay pass on it his decision.</p>

<p>26. It need hardly be observed, that the collectors will possess no
magisterial authority whatsoever: application will be regularly made by
him to the Resident, as judge and magistrate, whenever it becomes necessary
to call on that officer for aid in either capacity, whether to punish the
misconduct of servants, or to realize by civil suit any part of the dues of
government. The process to be observed, in either case, will be precisely
similar to what is prescribed where the two parties in the suit are private
individuals: government by no means wishing to enjoy themselves any
better security of right, than that which they would ensure to the
meanest of their subjects, nor to possess a greater facility of redress than
is provided by their regulations to be offered to any individual who shall
consider himself as aggrieved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclv" id="Page_mmclv">[Vol II Pg clv]</a></span></p>

<p>27. As the first step towards the introduction of an adequate system of
internal administration, it becomes positively necessary that government
should be furnished with the fullest and completest view of the actual
resources of the country.</p>

<p>28. The minutest details must be collected, arranged, and considered,
before any system can be properly reduced to practice, or any assessment
can be justly made.</p>

<p>29. But when once this body of information is obtained, the business
of the revenue settlement will become comparatively light, and will be
able to be proceeded with on the clearest and most equitable principles.
It will serve too, on all future occasions, as a complete collection of the
most valuable data to which to refer back for any purpose, or on which
to ground any measures that may, in future, be deemed advisable. The
obtaining this, government are fully aware, must be a work the most
laborious: but placing the fullest reliance on the zeal, industry, and
talents of those officers through whom they expect to derive such information,
they look forward with confidence to its accomplishment in a
manner as complete, and in a period as short as is possible, where
inquiries are to be made at once so minute and so extensive.</p>

<p>30. It must be considered too, that however heavy, at first, this compilation
may prove, it will ultimately most materially save both the time
and trouble of the collectors. Daily occurrences will constantly require
that information which it is now desired should be at once obtained; and
by possessing such a standard for conducting the business, a simple
reference to it will very often be sufficient, when otherwise there would arise
a necessity for instituting inquiries of the same nature, numberless and
troublesome, on every new, however trivial, occasion. Every collector,
in short, who is anxious to perform well the duties entrusted to him, must
wish to be in possession of such a mass of information as is now proposed
to be collected.</p>

<p>31. The best mode to be adopted will be as follows:</p>

<p>The collector, attended by his native assistant, and such servants as are
necessary, must himself proceed to the chief station in each division,
where he will cause to be assembled the head inhabitants of the several
villages contained in it. To these he must clearly explain the nature of
the information desired; and through their means it is expected that it
will be obtained without difficulty.</p>

<p>32. Whenever it may be necessary, the collector will visit the village
itself, and on the spot cause such inquiries to be made as are requisite.</p>

<p>33. The officers of survey, lately attached to the Residents, will accompany
the collectors through this tour, and give such professional aid as
may be desired.</p>

<p>34. They will make one general survey of the whole collectorship,
forming therefrom a map, on an uniform scale of one English inch to an
English mile: in this the limits of each village and of each division will
be accurately defined, and the direction and situation of forests, rivers,
roads, mountains, &amp;c. will also be correctly delineated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclvi" id="Page_mmclvi">[Vol II Pg clvi]</a></span></p>

<p>35. By this general plan, the collector will know exactly the amount of
land to be accounted for by each village; and the several lesser sums, as
they will be thus brought together, will serve to prove the truth of the
aggregate statement.</p>

<p>36. These surveyors will further take any such lesser surveys or
measurements as they may be directed to do by the collectors.</p>

<p>37. The papers to be furnished by each village are three; forms for
which are the enclosures marked A, B, and C. Some observations are
necessary in explanation of these.</p>

<p>38. From the detailed papers of cultivators, and householders not
cultivators, will be framed the general account of the village. The reason
for separating the inhabitants into these two classes is obvious. It is
wished that the exact resources of the country may be seen at one view,
to know what part of the population are actually employed in the cultivation
of the soil, and to learn in what way the remainder are disposed
of. It is also considered but just, that to equalize in some measure
the payments from all ranks of people, a tenement tax (or more properly
a small rent for the ground on which their houses stand) should be levied
from those who contribute nothing to the land rents.</p>

<p>39. But as the extension of this through all the petty villages might be
deemed vexatious, and as, in reality, in those very small communities the
payment by any party is virtually a payment by the whole of the inhabitants,
it is resolved that such tax shall not be levied there. But there
is no reason for including in this indulgence the inhabitants of towns;
these, as in some places already ordered, should by means of such tax
contribute their just share of the payments to government.</p>

<p>40. The assessment and collection of this shall form part of the collector's
duty. The principle on which it must proceed will be to divide the
houses into three classes, according to their size and the general circumstances
of their owners.</p>

<p>41. These will be assessed according to the class, at three, two, or one
Javan rupee per annum; and where, in any instance, from the indigence
of the householder, even this small payment could become a hardship, the
collector shall not include him at all in the assessment. This measure
will secure a considerable revenue to government, and by experience in
some districts already, it is known that it will not be considered as
vexatious or unjust by the inhabitants: they will deem it no hardship to
pay so small a sum annually, to be secured in the unmolested possession
of the ground and enclosure in which their houses stand: more especially
now that they are freed from all forced deliveries and services, without
adequate payment either to government or to the native chiefs, and are
left at liberty to enjoy the fruit of their labour.</p>

<p>42. The paper C. requires few observations: it explains itself. Every
householder shall have a number given to him; for in registering names
alone, very great confusion may arise, not only by the same being possessed
by numerous individuals, but by the singular practice which frequently
occurs among the Javans, of persons, from the most capricious motives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclvii" id="Page_mmclvii">[Vol II Pg clvii]</a></span>
assuming new appellations. The number being once fixed on each, there
will be no difficulty in always identifying them.</p>

<p>43. In the paper B., for the same reason above given, a number will
be added to each individual cultivator's name; that is, to each who will,
in the detailed system to be carried into effect, become an actual renter of
land from government.</p>

<p>44. With respect to the quantity of land, of produce, or of money, as
it is most desirable that there should be one uniform standard for the
whole island, to which every other measurement, weight, or currency
may be reduced, a circular letter has been written, dated 11th February,
1814, on the subject of currency, weights, and measures, and the collectors
will be in future strictly guided by that, keeping their accounts only
in the terms therein authorized.</p>

<p>45. In estimating the produce, the average of several former years will
be the surest criterion. All sawah lands will be considered solely as to
what quantity of paddy they might produce. Where other species of
cultivation occurs, it shall nevertheless be estimated only with reference
to this standard, or what might have been the value of the crop had the
land been sown with rice.</p>

<p>46. In similar manner, the tegal lands (under which description are
comprehended all lands not subject to irrigation) shall be estimated, in
their produce, at what would be the quantity of maize from them were
that the sole crop.</p>

<p>47. These two kinds of cultivation are the most usual throughout the
island for these descriptions of land, and will be easy to form an assessment
where these two are only considered. The profit or loss, in substituting
other crops, must be the sole concern of the individual cultivators.</p>

<p>48. In the value of the produce, the prices for both the paddy and the
maize must be taken as they exist in the cheapest season of the year, and
actually procurable on the spot.</p>

<p>49. By assuming other rates than these, as for instance, the prices the
articles may bear in periods of the year when a greater scarcity prevails,
or at what they would sell were they disposed of in large towns, a false
estimate will be taken; and depending on such contingencies, a failure in
the realization of the assessed revenues might frequently occur.</p>

<p>50. In the remarks that may be made opposite to each cultivator, if
necessary, any circumstance may be entered that may be deemed by the
collector deserving of mention;​&mdash;but principally will fall under this
column the statement of such reasons as entitle the individual to a remission
of rent, such as the being an officer of government, a pensioner, &amp;c.
The general account A. will throw into one view the whole resources and
actual state of the village.</p>

<p>51. Each of these villages must have a number given to it by the officer
of division.</p>

<p>52. On the principles of complete survey, even the smallest quantity of
land must be accounted for; and the general division into such as are or
are not in use, naturally suggests itself. These are again subdivided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclviii" id="Page_mmclviii">[Vol II Pg clviii]</a></span>
other classes. The "cultivated land" will be formed by bringing together
the totals of the paper B.; "free land" will include generally all
such as are at present enjoyed by the village inhabitant, free of assessment,
as the area of the village itself, with its gardens, commons, &amp;c.
The "coffee grounds" still remaining in the possession of government
will be next entered; but it will be the duty of the collectors to let these
out, where they can, like other lands, to be converted to whatever purpose
the tenants may please.</p>

<p>53. The extent of the "teak forests" must likewise be given; and to
this will follow what are termed "government lands," that is, generally,
whatever is held by them for their own or the public benefit, exclusive of
the two foregoing classes. In the "general remarks" it will be necessary
to advert to the particular nature of this entry, specifying what lands
have formed it.</p>

<p>54. Of "lands not in use," the most important part is that which
specifies what are capable of being cultivated. The several qualities of
these cannot in every instance be quite correctly defined; but as far as
practicable, it is desirous to arrange them in the manner pointed out, that
is, into the two general descriptions of <em>Sawah</em> and <em>Tegal</em>. Next will
follow lands decidedly "unfit;"​&mdash;and finally, what are termed "jungle
lands;" these are such as do not produce teak. "In the general remarks,"
it will be necessary to take notice of this latter class, specifying, as far as
possible, to what kind of land they belong, whether by clearing they
might be susceptible of cultivation, or are naturally unfit for it. The
remaining heads in the paper need no observation: they explain themselves,
and will be at once filled up from the accounts B, and C.</p>

<p>55. Each officer of division shall, from these village accounts, frame
one general one of the district under his authority. The form is shewn
in the paper D. The only additional information to be furnished by him
in it, is the quantity of lands lying waste and uninhabited, which have not
been portioned out into villages; and in the "general remarks" subjoined,
it will be necessary to advert to these, pointing out their nature,
and the reasons for their being in such desert state.</p>

<p>56. Each division shall be regularly numbered.</p>

<p>57. The account marked E. is intended to give to government one
general view of the whole collectorship; at once showing into how many
divisions it is portioned out, and in each of those how many villages there
are, the general population under its several descriptions, the total amount
of land, what quantity of it is cultivated, how much is capable of being
so, the estimated value of the entire produce, the riches of its inhabitants,
which are chiefly comprised in the number of buffaloes and horses possessed
by them, &amp;c. &amp;c. And attached to these, any such observations
may be made as may suggest themselves to the collectors.</p>

<p>58. The collection of papers thus framed, will, it is deemed, put government
fully in possession of all the information they require.</p>

<p>59. On the first attempt by the British power to introduce an amended
system of land revenue through this island, from our paucity of informa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclix" id="Page_mmclix">[Vol II Pg clix]</a></span>tion
on the subject, and the extreme caution with which it was necessary
to proceed, it was thought requisite to have recourse to an intermediate
class of persons between the actual sovereign and the cultivator of the
soil, or to let out the whole lands of each village to its principal inhabitant.</p>

<p>60. But by this mere grant of lease, it was not by any means understood
that any acknowledgment was made of proprietary right to the soil
existing in those heads of villages. It was simply a step, arising from the
necessity of the occasion, from the impracticability of at once entering
upon a more detailed plan, and which at the moment of its adoption was
meant to be considered as temporary, to be no longer adhered to, if, on
the acquisition of further knowledge, a more particular system of management
should be deemed advisable.</p>

<p>61. The nature of landed tenure throughout the island is now
thoroughly understood. Generally speaking, no proprietary right in the
soil is vested in any between the actual cultivator and the sovereign; the
intermediate classes, who may at any time have enjoyed the revenues of
villages or districts, being deemed merely the executive officers of government,
who received those revenues only from the gift of their lord, and
who depended on his will alone for their tenure. Of this actual proprietary
right, there can be no doubt that it originally vested solely in the
sovereign; but it is equally certain, that the first clearers of the land
entitled themselves, as their just reward, to such a real property in the
ground they thus in a manner created, that whilst a due tribute of a
certain share of its produce for the benefit of being well governed was
paid to the sovereign power, that in return was equally bound not to disturb
them or their heirs in its possession. The disposal of this government
share was, therefore, all that could justly depend on the will of the
ruling authority, and consequently the numerous gifts of lands made at
various periods by the several sovereigns, have in no way affected the
right of the actual cultivator:​&mdash;all that any government could alienate
was merely its own revenue or share of the produce. This subject has
come under full discussion; and the above result, as regarding this island,
has been quite satisfactorily established.</p>

<p>62. The continuance, therefore, of the village system becomes only a
matter of consideration, on the grounds of whether it is more beneficial
than any other to government, or most likely to be conducive to the
general prosperity and welfare of the mass of the population.</p>

<p>63. No doubt, however, remains on the mind of government on this
question. The agency of the intermediate renters is considered as quite
unnecessary to be adopted in future. It is deemed, that such a plan of
settlement will leave the interest of the bulk of the people entirely at the
mercy of a set of numerous petty chiefs, who, however well they may
have hitherto conducted themselves, would certainly, in such case, possess
an ability of injury and oppression, against which the ruling power would
have left itself no adequate means of prevention or redress, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclx" id="Page_mmclx">[Vol II Pg clx]</a></span>
cannot therefore be permitted, consistently with the principles of good
government.</p>

<p>64. It has, therefore, been resolved, that this intermediate system be
entirely done away, the government determining to act, in future, through
its immediate officers, directly with each individual cultivator, and to
stand forward, in short, the sole collector and enjoyer of its own revenues.
On every view, indeed, of the subject, the <em>tiang-halit</em> (or as it is
termed in Western India, where it is understood to have been advantageously
introduced, the <em>ryot-war</em> settlement) is considered as that which
will at once prove most satisfactory to the people, and most beneficial to
the government.</p>

<p>65. In the period that has elapsed since the first settlement, a sufficient
knowledge has been obtained, by the most scrutinous investigation into
the whole minutiæ of the revenue affairs of the country, to render government
now fully competent to carry into execution that more detailed plan,
which it was always in their contemplation to introduce, as early as might
be practicable.</p>

<p>66. The several collectors will therefore take suitable measures for carrying
into effect the desired change, as soon as this may, from local or
other circumstances, be possible.</p>

<p>67. Of course, the expiration of the former leases must, in every
instance, be awaited; but the several preliminary steps may be proceeded
in without further delay. On no account must such leases be renewed.</p>

<p>68. As the term of the greater part of them will be closed by the
ensuing <em>puasa</em>, and as the business of the assessment and survey, as above
ordered, may with great advantage be carried on together, the principles
on which that settlement will proceed will be briefly laid down here.
Much however must be necessarily left to the discretion and judgment of
the officers to whom its conduct will be entrusted, and on whose zeal,
industry, and ability, this government fully relies.</p>

<p>69. As a general rule for the guidance of the collector, he shall continue
in possession all such persons as he finds actually holding and cultivating
land, and shall receive them as the renters from government in
the new settlement. Even though such cultivators shall not be able to
adduce proofs of any real property in the land, yet long occupancy, improving
culture, and general good conduct while in its possession, are
deemed to be claims of no weak nature, and certainly constitute a right,
in equity and sound policy, of being considered preferably to any others,
who have no such claims; and this right government is determined to
respect.</p>

<p>70. It must, however, be clearly understood, that no positive rights of
any nature will be infringed by this settlement. Every claim to property
in land must be freely heard, and fully inquired into, by the collectors;
and it is necessary, in doubtful cases, to submit the claim for the decision
of the Honourable the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>71. There have been, it is known, in many parts of the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclxi" id="Page_mmclxi">[Vol II Pg clxi]</a></span>
grants from the sovereign of lands in perpetuity, which are regularly
inheritable, and relative to which the original documents still exist. Of
these some have been made for religious purposes, others as rewards
or provision for relatives or the higher nobility. These alienations, as far
as it was justly in the power of the sovereign to make them, will certainly
not be set aside. Equity and good faith forbid it; but they equally
enjoin, that the extent of these alienations be clearly defined, and that the
rights of others be not compromised by them. The government share,
where granted away, will not be claimed, for this affects the government
alone. But there are certain other rights, those of the cultivators, which
cannot be admitted to have been in the slightest degree affected by such
grants; and in the enjoyment of them, therefore, they must be duly protected
by the government. Such proprietors of revenue, as they may be
termed, shall in short be allowed to act, with regard to the cultivators,
only as government themselves act toward theirs; that is, receiving a
fixed share of the produce: but whilst that is delivered, neither exacting
more, nor removing any individual from his land.</p>

<p>72. On these subjects it will become the duty of the collector to be
particularly careful and circumspect; to hear all claims, but to admit none
lightly, giving to each the fullest investigation prior to acknowledging
their validity.</p>

<p>73. When the collector shall have thoroughly acquainted himself with
the actual state and resource of each village, he shall proceed, as quickly
as he can, to the assessment of the land revenue, to be realized, not from
the village generally, but from each individual cultivator inhabiting it.</p>

<p>74. The head of the village shall be considered as the officer of government
to be employed in the collection of the revenue; for which a
certain portion of land shall be allowed to him. In consideration of this,
and possessing, as he will, due powers for its realization, he shall be considered
as responsible for its whole amount. By this means, every
advantage of the general village settlement will be obtained, without any
of its evils.</p>

<p>75. It must be observed, that all allotments of land, whether as pensions
or salaries, are to be made only provisionally; and in such grants
the government share will be all that is to be affected by them.</p>

<p>76. One lease shall be made for the whole village, according to the
form laid down in the enclosure F.</p>

<p>77. This will give to each individual a full knowledge of his rights,
and of what are the only dues to be expected from him by government.
No extortion or injustice can then exist, without being liable to instant
detection and punishment. To attain still further this end, it is ordered,
that a copy of this lease be lodged with the officer of division, and
another be kept for public inspection in the village office.</p>

<p>78. The head of the village shall also give to each renter an exact
account, according to the form in enclosure G.</p>

<p>79. By this the renter will know exactly the state of his affairs, and the
examination of these lesser papers will at once discover any fraud on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclxii" id="Page_mmclxii">[Vol II Pg clxii]</a></span>
part of the village officer; for he most, on each receipt of money or
kind, mark it in their accounts.</p>

<p>80. The officer of division will, in like manner, acknowledge on the
back of the general lease the several sums received by him from the head
of any village. The receipt of kind collections will, in the same way, be
acknowledged at the collector's office, when they are delivered in.</p>

<p>81. The manner of assessing the government share will proceed, as far
as practicable, as follows:</p>

<p>82. As the inferior descriptions of land require greater labour in their
cultivation, and as the actual quantity of produce left from each for the
use of the renter, is wished to be nearly the same, a different rate in
assessing must be observed for each.</p>

<p>83. The following is considered as the fairest scale for fixing the
government share from each species of land, and ought to be referred to,
as much as possible, as the general standard:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="government share from each species of land">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="0"><em>For Sawah Lands.</em></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1st sort,</td>
    <td>one-half</td>
    <td>of the estimated produce.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2d,</td>
    <td>two-fifths</td>
    <td class="tdc">ditto.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3d,</td>
    <td>one-third</td>
    <td class="tdc">ditto.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="0"><em>For Tegal Lands.</em></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1st sort,</td>
    <td>two-fifths </td>
    <td>of the estimated produce.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2d,</td>
    <td>one-third</td>
    <td class="tdc">ditto.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3d,</td>
    <td>one-fourth</td>
    <td class="tdc">ditto.</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>84. It must be expected, that less than this will be levied in many
places for some time to come. Various reasons will induce a low rental
being established at first, as the energies of many impoverished and long
oppressed districts are to be brought forth by every encouragement that
government can give; but when cultivation has reached what may be
considered as its state of perfection, and the settlement is completely
matured, the above must form the general rates of assessment.</p>

<p>85. Government think it necessary also explicitly to declare, that they
will be satisfied when the land revenue shall be productive to them in
these proportions, determining, at no future time, to raise that scale;
that the inhabitants, being thus exactly acquainted with what will form
the utmost demand on them, and resting in full confidence that government
will not exact any thing further, may, in that security, enjoy their
possessions in undisturbed happiness, and apply their utmost industry to
the improvement of their lands, assured that, while they conduct themselves
well, that land will never be taken from them, and that the more
productive they may be able to render it, the more beneficial will it be to
themselves.</p>

<p>86. The head of the village will deliver his money collections to the
officer of division, in such instances as may be directed by the collector;
but all payments in kind must be made actually into the collector's office
at the head station, the expenses of bringing it falling entirely on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclxiii" id="Page_mmclxiii">[Vol II Pg clxiii]</a></span>
renters. This is done chiefly with a view to discourage such species of
payments, government wishing to receive, as far as practicable, their
revenues in money alone. In ordering this, regard has also been had to
former custom, the contingent under the Dutch administration having
always been thus delivered in.</p>

<p>87. The option of kind payment is still left to the renter on many
accounts; in consideration, partly, of the present scarcity of specie
throughout the country, partly as being agreeable to their ancient usages,
which will always be paid the greatest attention to; but chiefly, as by
leaving this double mode of payment open, the assessment, both in this
and future settlements, will be able to be proceeded with on the justest
and best principles. Enhancement or remissions will be equitably regulated
by it; and, in short, by keeping the actual produce always in view,
the shares of the government and of the cultivator must always preserve
their due relation towards each other.</p>

<p>88. <em>Pari</em> or rice, however, are the only two articles to be received.
Maize is considered, in estimating the produce of the tegal lands, to produce
the justest assessment; but this must be invariably commuted for
a money rent on fair principles. To sawah landholders only will the option
of <em>pari</em> or rice deliveries be given. As cultivators, in most cases, hold
some of each description of land, this distinction will not be felt as a
hardship.</p>

<p>89. To guard against any failure in the estimated revenues, the value
of the produce will be calculated at the sum which it commonly sells for
in the village itself, immediately after the gathering in of the harvest;
and the money commutation will proceed on this principle. The renters,
therefore, will obviously be encouraged to pay money preferable to kind;
but should they nevertheless give in the latter, the head of the village
must, if he can, turn it into specie, so that the estimated value be
obtained. Should, in spite of these precautions, any quantity of <em>pari</em> or
rice arrive at the head station, the collector will deposit it in the storehouses,
and report in what manner he is of opinion it can be most advantageously
disposed of. Generally speaking, government wish to derive
no extra profit from this branch of their revenues, and will approve of
immediate sale, in every instance where the assessed price can be obtained.</p>

<p>90. As arrears are to be as much guarded against as possible, remissions
of rent must sometimes be made. The mode of regulating these
will be as follows. When such calamity of season or other cause, occurs,
as may be supposed to entitle the cultivator to indulgent consideration in
some deduction of rent, a report must be made by the head of the village
before gathering the harvest, and the collector will then order the officer
of division, or send some trusty servant from his own office, to survey the
crop, and inquire into the causes of its falling short of the estimate.
Such orders will afterwards be issued, whether remitting any part or the
whole of the dues of government, or enforcing their strict collection, as
may be deemed necessary. Whenever a real, unavoidable suffering has
been sustained, a remission of rent must be granted, government deem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclxiv" id="Page_mmclxiv">[Vol II Pg clxiv]</a></span>ing
it far preferable to conciliate their subjects by every reasonable favour,
and even to submit to a slight loss, than to disaffect them by the continual
harassing which the strict exaction of heavy arrears must occasion. Nor
will, indeed, any real gain accrue from being thus always unrelenting;
for, in most cases, the liquidation of the debts they may have incurred
will only be effected by the sale of buffaloes, horses, and other property,
on the possession of which must entirely depend the good performance of
their future engagements; so that, in fine, by resorting to this measure,
the debt may be discharged, but very frequently the cultivator will be
lost.</p>

<p>91. As the first settlement, according to this amended system, cannot
be expected to attain as accurate an assessment as is desirable, it is not
deemed advisable that the leases to be granted should exceed the period
of one year.</p>

<p>92. From the nature of the foregoing instructions, the collectors cannot
fail to observe the importance and extent of the obligations imposed on
them by the office intrusted to their charge. It is not enough that the
government lay down the principles of a benevolent system intended to
introduce the practical freedom which has been bestowed on all the nations
subject to the honourable Company's dominions; it is with them that
the application of these principles is entrusted, and to their temper, assiduity,
judgment, and integrity, that the people have to look for the
enjoyment of the blessings which it is intended to bestow upon them.
They have, in short, the national character, as well of their own personal
reputation, to support; and while the Lieutenant Governor in Council feels
it unnecessary to rouse that spirit of public virtue in which it is the pride
of a Briton to excel, or to advert to the shame that must follow a neglect
of these important duties, he deems it proper to remark, that his most
vigilant attention will be given to the progress of the great work which
has been commenced, and that it will always afford him the highest
gratification to bring to public notice, and reward the examples of industry,
honour, and integrity, which he constantly expects to meet with.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX M.<br />

<em><span class="smcap">Memorandum</span> respecting <span class="smcap">Weights</span>, <span class="smcap">Measures</span>, &amp;c.</em></h2>


<p>The weights and measures not only differ, both nominally and essentially,
in the several districts of Java, but are often subject to such
varieties, even within the same district, that the greatest confusion in
accounts, and endless peculations, are almost inevitable. The native
denominations and divisions are blended with the Chinese and European,
and even the latter have been made to vary so much, that it is difficult
to refer them to one common standard. The uncertainty of the native
measures has, however, been considerably removed, by the reference
constantly had by the Chinese to the weight of the article, instead of the
bulk, which is the usual measure of the Javans.</p>

<p>The measure of weight which may be considered as the most general
standard throughout the country, is the Chinese <em>kati</em>, equal to about
1¼ lb., or about 20 ounces avoirdupois; 100 <em>katis</em> make a <em>pikul</em> of 125 lbs.
Dutch, or 133⅓ English, 30 <em>pikuls</em> or 3,000 <em>katis</em>, being 3,750 lbs. Dutch.
The Dutch standard <em>koyan</em>, however, is only 3,400 lbs., and in general is
considered equal to a last, or two tons; but this weight, by which the
rude produce of the country is generally calculated, is subject to innumerable
varieties. In order to cover the wastage, it was the rule of the
government that there should be one rate for receipt of goods, and another
for their delivery. This varied according as the article was perishable or
otherwise, or to the degree of peculation established by usage. This
applied to all measures and weights by which goods were received and
issued at the government stores, and the rates were different in different
districts. A <em>koyan</em> among private individuals at Batavia is generally considered
as 27 <em>pikuls</em>, equal to 253 <em>gantons</em>, or 2,700 <em>katis</em>; at <em>Semárang</em> as
28 <em>pikuls</em>, but by the natives generally as 30 <em>pikuls</em>. The <em>koyan</em>, however,
by which the contingent was formerly delivered to government, at <em>Demak</em>
was no less than 4,250 lbs. Dutch.</p>

<p><em>Pári</em>, or rice in the husk, is generally calculated by the <em>amat</em>, and in
some districts by the <em>sáng'ga</em>. When the <em>pári</em> is reaped, which is invariably
done by snapping or cutting each separate straw a few inches below
the husk, the sheaf or bundle as it accumulates is laid in the left hand,
between the thumb and middle finger: the quantity which can be thus
held is termed <em>sa agem</em>, which is therefore equivalent to a handful. Three
of these make a <em>pochong</em>, a quantity which can be clasped between the
two hands. The sheaf is then bound. Afterwards, when the grain and
straw are dry, two of these <em>pochongs</em> are bound together in one larger
bundle, which is termed <em>gedeng</em>. Four <em>gedengs</em> make one <em>bawon</em>, and five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_mmclxvi" id="Page_mmclxvi">[Vol II Pg clxvi]</a></span>
<em>gedengs</em> one <em>sang'ga</em>: three <em>bawon</em> make one <em>wuwa</em>, and two <em>wuwa</em> one
<em>amat</em>; the <em>gedeng</em> is sometimes four, five, and even sometimes nine
<em>katis</em>.</p>

<p>In the <em>Semárang</em> districts alone, the <em>amat</em> varied from 200 to 600 <em>katis</em>
in weight. In the western and <em>Sunda</em> districts <em>pari</em> is measured by the
<em>chain</em>, of which there are the common and the mountain <em>chain</em>, the one
being equal to 4,000 lbs. Dutch, the other about 1,000 <em>katis</em>. The <em>kati</em>,
however, is the usual measure.</p>

<p>Land measure is by the natives regulated in general by the <em>bawat</em>, a
measure of length, formed of the staff stick of the <em>payong</em>, or umbrella,
which the <em>Bópati</em>, or native chief of a province, receives on his investiture.
The length of this stick, when drawn from the umbrella, is termed
a <em>changkal</em>, and is from nine to twelve feet. The principal divisions of
land are into the <em>bahu</em> and <em>jung</em>. Four of the former make a <em>jung</em>; but
these not only differ in size according to the length of <em>changkal</em>, but the
situation of the land and the nature of the soil; the <em>jungs</em> of rich land,
and in the vicinity of the principal towns, being much smaller than the
poor lands situated at a distance. The endless varieties of these measurements
it would be tedious to detail. One <em>jung</em> in the <em>Semarang</em> districts
is equal to three others, to five, to six, seven, and even so many as ten,
in other parts. From this perplexing inequality of measurement arose
formerly, in many instances, the comparative disproportion of the cultivator's
contributions to the state, as each <em>jung</em> of every size was assessed
with the payment of a fixed contingent. In many instances the <em>jung</em> was
rather to be considered the measure, not so much of the land as of its
produce.</p>

<p>The advantage of reducing these vague and uncertain measures to some
fixed standard, had in some degree attracted the attention of the Dutch
government, during the administration of Marshal Daendels, who directed
that the lands in several districts should be measured according to an
average <em>jung</em> of two thousand square rods or <em>changkals</em> of twelve feet
Dutch. This measurement being generally known as the government
<em>jung</em>, although it had only been very partially introduced in one or two
districts, was made the standard in the recent agricultural survey of the
country; and although it was not deemed advisable to introduce at the
moment an entire change in the local usages of each district, the public
officers were directed to refer to it on all occasions; and in the statistical
and other returns, the local measurement of the place has accordingly been
invariably reduced to this standard. The government <em>jung</em> of two thousand
square <em>changkals</em> of twelve feet English, is equal to 6<sup>74</sup>⁄<sub>121</sub> English acres;
and the government <em>amat</em>, by which the produce is weighed, being fixed
at two thousand <em>katís</em>, is equal to two <em>pikuls</em>, or 266⅔ lbs. English.</p>

<p>In reducing the coins circulating in Java into English money, in the
course of this work, the Spanish dollar has been considered as equal to five
shillings English, and the <em>rupee</em> to half a crown. In the local currency of
Java, ten copper doits make one <em>wang</em> (a small silver coin), and twelve
<em>wangs</em> one <em>rupee</em>.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
